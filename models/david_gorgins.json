      "text": "five four three two one boom and we're live thanks for doing this man I appreciate it hey thank you for having me I appreciate that he's the only guy I've ever had in the studio where when I showed up you were working out that's what I do mask my life that's my life it's pretty crazy though I mean how much time did you have when you got here I got here about an hour early oh yeah okay so I got here shirt off doing chin up hilarious I think if I camera out in time for you song I wanted to take some pictures well maybe next time next time well catch you after the show you are a guide that for a lot of people you sort of embody the idea of hardening your mind and figuring out a way to do things that most people think are impossible all right let's you've sort of become that guy over your life and you've become that guy for a lot of people including me online we've talked about you on the podcast a ton of times so having you in here has been it's very exciting to me I appreciate that thank you how'd you become that guy you know what I grew up not that guy yeah so a lot of people put a title on me they want to they see me now they see me now as the guy that with his shirt off who can do 4030 pull-ups in 17 hours you can run tours in five miles in 39 hours who can do all this crazy [ __ ] but what they don't understand is they don't understand the journey that it took me to get to this point and what got me to this point was I was just the opposite everything the day I was that guy who ran away from absolutely everything that I got in front of me but not many people knew that I had two people at the like the real me was like this very scared insecure stuttering got beat up by his dad all this kind of stuff and I built this fake person that walked around like my [ __ ] didn't stink you know you know that yeah so that was that's kind of how I did it and I do the process of time I realized that I was lying to myself and lying to people but that it's a fascinating journey though because you are that guy now Ryan you genuinely are legit badass right at one point in time you were a legit terrified person yes so what was the process like how did how did you step forth well it's a it's a long process right um I my dad beat the [ __ ] I mean was growing up we I was the first black baby born in this hospital called Millard Fillmore in Buffalo New York my dad owned skating rinks he owned bars he ran prostitutes from Canada to Buffalo New York my dad was a big-time pimp big-time anything bad about a person big-time hustler he was American you know that I'm with them Denzel Washington he was that but not that bad right yeah he wasn't that big but that's what it reminds me of he was that kind of guy and beat the [ __ ] out of me did she help you no I love my mom there was an instant one time when my mom got knocked out on top of stairs and they drug her down the stairs by her hair at six years old I'll never forget this in my mind I was always afraid my whole life I was afraid but I had this [ __ ] voice this this conscience that would always be battling me said hey you got to get up and do something I didn't want to do [ __ ] you know I was just afraid but I would that that voice would forced me to get up and my dad you know I try to beat him up whatever at six and I get my ass kicked so this went on for several years and I have a big time learning disability can my dad didn't believe in us going to school so my dad it was about the business the skating rink in the bar so this game you open about seven o'clock at night and this is when time I was able to walk so about five you know four or five six years old eight nine and I go to the skating rink it's ten o'clock at night and I worked the skating rink until 10:00 at night and then we would scrape the gum off the floors and we cleaned the whole skating rink up and then my dad at the office and my brother and myself asleep in the office and my mama go upstairs and worked the bar until three o'clock in the morning and then they cleaned the bar up so after all that [ __ ] was done with going to school really happened so when I went to school I was all kind of you know my learning disability I had social anxiety I was just a jacked up kid from living in this tour at home from the outside looking in we live in the all-white neighborhood and then we would travel to the ghetto of Buffalo New York with the skating rink was that so we you know we worked around mostly blacks and I lived around mostly White's but no one knew what was going on the house that on 201 Paradise Road yeah it's crazy but um my mom got courage to finally leave him when I was by 8 years old we moved to a small town in Brazil Indiana and that's when the real war started for me and Brazilian is a small town great people a lot of great people and I say that because like people get offended and I'm gonna get to the point where they get offended there was about maybe 10 black families at about 10,000 people in the town and in 1995 the KKK marched in the 4th of July parade so this was a not every bar was racist there's a lot of good people some the best people I knew was there but there's also a lot of racism there so me being one of the few black kids net you know in the area you know it kind of haunts you I had stuff on my notebook you know [ __ ] we're gonna kill you on my Spanish notebook they had that on my car [ __ ] this is early 90s and so even though I sold it didn't hurt me it was jacking me up so all the insecurities I have when I was a kid with my father I moved into this area here and it just got worse and worse and worse and it [ __ ] haunted me and that voice that talked about it kept talking louder and louder and louder I was doing nothing about it and I decided to make moves and I cheated all through school and it's kind of humbling to talk with my stories sometimes in this um it's also embarrassing but it's real it's who the [ __ ] I am is what I am is what created me and copy from the fourth grade to the to my junior year in high school on every assignment and I want to get in the military I'm gonna join the airforce and the guy gave me an as vapp test as I could water down SAT and I couldn't copy on it because the guy beside me how to test a test B they got him I write he had test C so I looked the copy on this test and I couldn't copy on so I got like a 20 and I wanted to be an Air Force pararescueman it's guys that jump out of airplanes and save down pilots it's a it's a special operator in the Air Force and my squirt was so horribly low that is we take it again and he said hey I got an 18 the second time even worse I need to get a 50 out of a 99 and so a mom and I for a while we lived in the government subsidized apartments seven dollars a month and also food stamps and we slowly moved up to a $230 a month place but at the time you know we you know pretty poor but um my mom afforded enough money for me to go to see a tutor one one hour a week so for four hours a month it had six months to study from our last test I can only take the best you know the answer to test three times and I studied my ass off and passed it I got in the Air Force and realized there was more things in front of me I was afraid of water terrified the water and I've learned how to swim but what gets everybody in this training in all special ops training is the water confidence where they try to pretty much drowned your ass you know all of our lives we've been breathing and they take that from you and they want to see how comfortable you are in the water and there's a 1% african-americans in Special Operations and I didn't know anything about African like a lot of them are negative buoyant which I am because the bone density I struggled but I'm six weeks into the program there was about 25 guys left of about 150 I was there and I was never I didn't gonna sleep for six weeks of the program and I wanted to quit so badly but I quit everything in my life I copied through school I want to prove people wrong and so here I am in this Air Force program start to get a little more confidence but this water was kicking my ass and six weeks in the program the doctor gave me a blood test and must have sickle-cell sickle cell trait not the anemia but I still killed people but so they pulled me out training for a week and when you go from being very uncomfortable in that water situation and then now you're comfortable and I'm sitting back watching the guys drown I'm not you know I'm not part of the activities anymore for this week I don't want to get back in that damn water again so the fear overcame in all my insecurities for my dad from this small town from everything started coming back and even though no one knew how [ __ ] up I was kind of create this other person tough I live with this [ __ ] all time so mean I wouldn't go back in that water the doctor called me a backup I thought to get like a like a medical kick out of the military so no quitting for me they kicked me out so I can have some pride the doctor said no I'm kidding you know we could put you back in the training and I was like [ __ ] but after a week I'm like you know what I missed one week there's only three weeks left there's a good chance you know I could tough this [ __ ] out and go on but I went back to the CEO and the commanding officer of the program and the sergeant said hey you gotta start from day one because you missed you know that that week of training and I broke I broke I couldn't imagine going back through that again so I made up a lie and I said man there's sickle-cell things really scaring me it was the [ __ ] water it wasn't sickle cell and and I pretty much quit even though they gave me a medical and I quit so um from the age of 19 days of 22 I went into the job called tack pee where you control fast movers behind enemy lines cool job but there's no water I was afraid of water so I've avoided it and I gained 125 pounds in that time frame I went from 175 to almost 300 to 297 was my heaviest and I started finding things that was comfortable and the more things I found comfortable the more uncomfortable my mind was because that voice I was telling you about it always was there I was trying to avoid that conscience I wanted to be left alone from that conscience and it wouldn't leave me alone so I got out of the Air Force and I started working for a job called ecolab respray for cockroaches at 24 and I'm spraying at different staking sheiks Red Lobster whatever from 11 o'clock at night at 7 o'clock in the morning and what changed I came home and watch this Discovery Channel show class 224 I came home from Steak N Shake I sprayed it down last get a big ol large 42 ounce shake walk across the street and get a box of mini doughnuts from 7-eleven you never drive home for 45 minutes this big old fat guy who yeah I worked out but I was fat I didn't run didn't PT I just hit the gym so I'm driving home turn the TV on and what comes on Discovery Channel so and that's what everything changed for me I was taking a shower I walked out heard these guys and I watched the show and it made me reflect big-time on the piece of [ __ ] that I am and I'm exactly what people said I was going to be so so what was on this show that really struck home it was um I saw these guys going into water so I was terrified of it I can't even express have you ever had a big fear and I know a lot of fighters have fears and stuff like that but they get over them but all of us have these fears that you just don't want to [ __ ] face and um I have a lot of them had a lot of them and that's what created the person who's in front of today and we'll get into that but I'm just a scared [ __ ] is what I was and but I was watching these guys going through hell week class 2:24 and these guys ringing the bell quitting dropping their helmet down rolling out a lot of guys is leaving and it made me reflect on my fears my insecurities and I saw real men when I thought were real men who were staying who were overcoming adversity who were overcoming all these different things that I had blamed so many [ __ ] people in my life my dad my mom for not being there when I was 14 years old my my mama's would get remarried to this great guy he got murdered and then I moved back to a small town in Brazil and and I everybody was a blame my learned disability my my skin color you know me being everything and so I sat there for a while and I was like man I gotta [ __ ] I got it no one's gonna [ __ ] come to help me no one's gonna [ __ ] come to help me his [ __ ] me against me period and I'm so I had to man up and I said first thing I started doing is facing every [ __ ] fear I have no matter what the [ __ ] it is man and these things would keep me up and that no one people who are here in this [ __ ] day they will never really understand and grasp when you face these things and so many things how they keep you up and haunts you at night I think there's a lot of people out there that know what you're talking about I mean and so that's what it did and I had two options to either be that 300-pound guy who spray for cockroaches and thousand dollars a month and at 24 years old knowing we're not 50 [ __ ] years old I can reflect on this and think about what God never became or I can totally just sack it up and fail and fail and fail entire succeed so I started calling recruiters up I said we'll be a [ __ ] Navy SEAL and every recruiter so there's a weight and height so they weigh weight and height limit to get in the military and I was 6 foot 1 and to 97 and I had prior service which was a big deal so I called all these recruiters up and all of them said hey how tall are you bla bla they got into conversation and see if I even qualified and by the time I got to my weight phone we were hanging up pretty much like hey you know what call somebody else you know try to get in the reserves so I tried to get in the reserves and I called this guy named Steven salad your recruiter up and he said hey come on in he saw me put me through the weight standard all the sort of stuff and to get into the class I had to get into how to lose 106 pounds in less than 3 months so I was like [ __ ] that I can't do that I grabbed my chocolate milkshake and went back to Ecolab I'm going back to work man this is my life so in this job you look you know you're looking for cockroach she's looking for rodents and stuff like that and this next morning or this next night I went to work and I hit the all-night cockroaches too much I hit the mother lode of cockroaches and this restaurant got full of cockroaches and rodents and everything else and I sat there and said this is my life I said this is my life you are exactly who the [ __ ] that this is it and I said this ain't gonna be it for me so in that restaurant I quit my job left my canister in that restaurant my spray canister got back in my ecolab truck and I went home and I started working out like somebody I was I became the most obsessed person on the planet Earth that was basically I had to invent a guy that didn't exist I had to invent a guy that can take any pain any suffering any kind of judgment be called [ __ ] be called whatever the [ __ ] in the world and be understanding the [ __ ] room and said go [ __ ] yourself I had it built the I had to build this callous mind and I built it to suffering I built it to downright [ __ ] just crushing myself if it was raining outside three o'clock in the [ __ ] morning feeling the first instinct is don't go out there and do [ __ ] my instinct was we gotta [ __ ] go out there anything that was [ __ ] horrible in my life that I would normally say no that was inhumane that most people I had to go do it and I started callous in my mind at this point in my life and I lost the weight I lost the weight and I went back to recruiter I got into that class and I went through three Navy sohail weeks in one year only God ever be in three hell weeks in one year after my knowledge the first one I didn't make it through the next two I did and that I just didn't stop anymore from there and I started realizing through this through this process that the [ __ ] mind is what you created and I started opening different doors that I didn't think we're even there they didn't think even existed and the more doors are opening up the more I start realizing that my potential is damn near endless and it changed my whole mindset so I went from David Goggins and I created Goggins and that journey is a priceless journey that is hard for me to explain to people because it sounds so quick and easy that guy's lost this weight and I went through three healthiest I went to Ranger school went to Delta Force Lexus whatever it is it was brutal it's a brutal journey every [ __ ] day and if ever less what are you happy if anybody knows my life story and I try to give you a just a snippet of it where I'm at two days in front of Joe Rogan telling you my life to get through what I became to get to where I'm at now there's nothing but pride I have for myself that I can't really I can't really show people because I have this face and a space that they see like are you happy what's wrong with you I'm driven I'm obsessed and that's what you see that's it people need to hear this story this is a this is an exciting story for people because there's a lot of people out there that feel trapped and they feel stuck and they feel like they can't do anything this is who they are you're a guy who felt that exact same way but figured out how to not be that person and be a person you would admire how did you what were the first steps like you had some slips before right because you you quit because of the water thing right but then when you went back the second time and you decide you're going to lose all that weight and you quit that job did did you was it just straight forward from there or whether there's some days where you just failed and then you picked it back up again so my first run when I decided to lose the weight I was like I said 297 I was about thirty two percent body fat and I went my idea was to run four miles for my first run I didn't know how bad it's gonna [ __ ] hurt me I used to run before I was fat and I was like [ __ ] it I can do this I ran a quarter mile and walked home I walked home and sat on my couch and cried I miss my mom's house who was about 40 about maybe 20 minutes down the road and cried and getting her couch saying I can't [ __ ] do this I don't know what I'm gonna do I just got somebody pregnant my life was this [ __ ] I was making $1,000 a month my rent was 8/10 a month and my mind just kept [ __ ] with me and kept [ __ ] you're not good enough man this isn't for you man these guys are best mother [ __ ] on the planet Earth you not that and what it was and it's kind of funny I was obsessed with rocky rocky one in particular and when I was a kid I come home every day and I watched his [ __ ] show rocky and I was fast forward with the little VHS tapes to round 14 round 14 [ __ ] me up like nobody's business why this song came on right so when I bought the pull-up record I listened to the song for 17 hours it's two minutes and 13 seconds and I'm able to visualize and dream like nobody's business and I know that I can create a vision that many people can't and I work for it so the vision I had was when Apollo Creed beat the [ __ ] [ __ ] out of Rocky beat the [ __ ] out of him he's kept fighting he was a dumb fighter couldn't read couldn't [ __ ] on me couldn't read couldn't write just punchy everything about him and rocky beaches are probably [ __ ] using that corner everybody was saying stay the [ __ ] down and him getting up him getting up Apollo Creed raised his arms up in the [ __ ] air turn around thought he won the fight he turns around and sees this guy getting up and it was the face of Apollo Creed that changed my life the face of Apollo Creed it was like just by that [ __ ] getting up not winning just by him getting the [ __ ] up Apollo Creed was his champ his best rocky had taken his soul had literally taken his soul his his head goes down he looks down like Ruth what the [ __ ] are you I wanted to be that not Rocky I want to be the guy that people looked at I don't keep you've liked me or didn't like I don't care but said this [ __ ] is gonna keep coming after whatever the [ __ ] is in front of them I wanted that I wanted that I wanted that worse than anything in the world so that is I kept picturing me falling down and getting up and every [ __ ] that called me [ __ ] I was dumped even myself even myself I wanted to feel something besides two feet I wanted to just go to distance and that going a distance pushed me to a point of where now I go way past the distance so you go the first day you run a quarter-mile and you walk back home and you're you're upset how do you how do you move forward so basically idea was I came home and I had a talking milkshake I sat down and I gave up I said it saying go [ __ ] happen Mac I lose 106 pounds and I came and go a quarter a [ __ ] mile I started being able to take negative [ __ ] and be happy and this whole I say what if a lot it sounds corny and it sounds weak but it's true one of the recruiters said there's not many black Navy SEALs in fact I was a thirty six african-american seal in history is in overseas because the [ __ ] water you know I mean people get mad at me it's [ __ ] true just get over it and so I was like man what story would it be if my [ __ ] fat dumb lying to be people insecure ass can overcome this [ __ ] and that would if mentality like that that dreamer mentality just would always fuel me it was just ruin man what if I can be but if I can be a seal man what if I can go from wearing a quarter of [ __ ] mile now I run 205 miles what if I can go but just what if I can go in and what if how would that feel if I'm graduating kind of get at that graduation thing I was talking about 224th like the video I said then I'll watch this command officer stood up and he said to the graduation guys you're graduating buds like eighteen of them he said we live in a society where mediocrities often rewarded and we don't to say something about these men detest mediocrity and I wanted to be a man that the test mediocrity you know it got me a lot of trouble in the SEAL Teams and going forward in my life because I just I started looking down on people for not going hardest [ __ ] [ __ ] and I started to create different things but that's for a different day but I just believe that it you know my whole mind changed that is a problem that a lot of people who work hard to have you get angry at people who don't work hard to the point where you you know you want to insult them you want to you want to smack them and it's really because you're scared of seeing that yourself yeah that's probably the truth that's probably the truth so I guess a lot of times my life I would see people and it part was a direct reflection of who I was and I would get mad at them but reflections probably just be getting mad at myself yeah that's for me 100% when I when I see people they're half-ass some things I get terrified of seeing that in myself and I get mad at them right and it's uh it's not a good way to handle it no you know but it's it's natural because you're just terrified of seeing that trait right and it cost me so you come back mmm you do the quarter-mile right you walk back home how do you regroup so what I did I sat down then I put rocky in I got my milkshake put rocky ice you know what I was big-time in Rocky and platoon why platoon I love to see people who were getting beat down and this there's there's scenes there's scenes that this drove me and people in my hell weeks you know I was in three of them always hear me singing these songs these songs humming these songs in torturous situations when you're when everybody's quitting this [ __ ] code I would be somewhere gone somewhere [ __ ] gone if somewhere [ __ ] darkest [ __ ] there's a scene of platoon when Elias Wimborne and shoots Elias and you know they think Elias is dead and the choppers are taking off and charlie sheen's ask him you know Tom Berenger where's Elias reason lies Willem Dafoe I found him back there dead somewhere and through the woods the Viet Cong has chasing he lies through the woods and the shoot him in his [ __ ] back and all he wants to do is get to the [ __ ] chopper he's getting shot in his back he's getting up getting something face getting up and you see this guy just fighting I love the [ __ ] guy who just [ __ ] fights and so I put these things in as reminders that you're gonna have to [ __ ] suffer man this [ __ ] point two-five man this is man you're gonna have to [ __ ] suffer to go from this fat insecure [ __ ] to one of the best guys on the planet Earth this journeys could take something that is going to be incomprehensible to most people and these different visualizations how I visualized myself talked it became so nasty and dirty that I wasn't liked the fact that I went point to five so it became from being defeated to like man all right [ __ ] maybe you know maybe tomorrow and go point seven-five you know it just became this different mindset I turn negatives into positives so I would I would take it like who would even think about doing this so I would sit in my couch saying who at 297 who can't [ __ ] swim that great who scary the [ __ ] water we have the [ __ ] balls kind of balls to [ __ ] man up quit a job and go and it put everything on himself so it's how I started talking to myself and put myself in a whole different category and that was fueling me the next day and I just kept using that as fuel and fuel no one would do this [ __ ] no one do this [ __ ] you're the best [ __ ] around you're the best [ __ ] ever live and I had the guys kept fueling me with them with the right kind of message that I needed to hear that was never telling myself and through time became reality to myself so you start out on the first day and then do you start running again the second day yeah the second day was right back after again but I start realizing I can't run that for right so what I did was I became damn near a professional cyclist with the miles I put it on the bike so I never we never watched TV I had to be doing something so I was riding the bike I rode a bike a lot to lose the first initial kind of weight cuz it took my bones were just hurting so bad my bow is broken and I learned to get over that also and I tried to swim a lot I weren't a great swimmer but putting fins on kind of equalized my body I wasn't so negative buoyant so I started fitting a whole bunch and I spent hours in the pool hours in the pool trying to get more and more comfortable not because I was going underwater I was so scared of the water that I had to live in the water I had to become one with the water so going to the pool used to scare me so I went to the pool an awful awful lot and then the bike got easier I was able to run more I went from like one mile one mile was a great accomplishment two miles and then from 2 to 3 was a big one I went from 3 to 6 and then like they have a warning order that they give people to get ready for buts and the whole thing was running 6 miles five days a week and that was my goal and so I just kept I failed I go back to scratch I use some positive motivation I have like one day where I like [ __ ] defeated but I started realizing this a part of the process this is a part of the journey I had to realize this is part of my process versus just saying like I used to I'm just not good enough if I'm not good enough we always say that [ __ ] that's not good enough and then we try something else I'm gonna [ __ ] make myself good enough and that became my mentality I'm gonna make myself good enough and so I misunderstood a lot but that's that's all it came down to I made myself good enough and the days I couldn't run that far the next week I would do two a days so on the running if I ran a quarter-mile I weighed a [ __ ] couple hours it haunt me bother me I try to run a half a mile next time same day you can do more than this if I had to walk ahead and walk it just became just a process of grinding and grinding and grandees not even a good word for it it's not even a good word for it and just just going further and further and then when I got through running I go to the bike I go to the pool if I got tired somewhere my legs are tired I go to the gym and I develop this crazy workout where I was doing volume like two-three hundred reps of like very lightweight people I said how you know how come you have any like loose skin my workout routine the gym became sick it became sick I was just doing two three hundred reps four hundred reps on like chest just like for one simple exercise the best press and a racket get back on it just rep it out trying to burn as many calories I can't build that muscle mass and ice became just became obsessed with it so when you're doing this are you worried at all about repetitive stress injuries or the fact that your body's not conditioned for this and you're basically taking your body where you had abused it right and now you're you're forcing it to live like in an elite athlete right I didn't care I didn't know any better I didn't think about it wow I didn't I didn't know that working out that hard would [ __ ] you up I did it [ __ ] you up oh yeah yeah that's one reason I'm with you three Hill weeks so I don't talk about a lot but um the stress of my life getting to 24 calls me have some serious so as issues I know anything about this [ __ ] there's so as muscles what we use history hip flexor muscle and basically under stress it starts to tighten up and I was I started for from the time I was in third grade time I was in seventh grade white blotches on my skin I was just I was in that case and so the insides of me are also getting [ __ ] up so in this process my soul has mostly got real tight to my t12 I can show you the bump on the back of my head after this show is over but I had I started growing this [ __ ] like large tumor or looking bump on the back of my head from my body compressing so I'm six foot one but my muscles were like five foot nine because I just started just the muscle tightness for my so ass going to my t12 I was just getting tighter my quads everything getting tired from just stress just stress in my life so the more I stressed my body with the workouts my lower body became out of balance so I had a bunch of stress fractures bunch of injuries going through buds and how I got through buds was they gave me my third time was my last time going through hell week I basically put a black sock on at four o'clock in the morning and I would get duct-taped I had a numerous stress fractures on both of my legs because my my body was literally like coming in on itself in my legs like I was I was pronating it really bad and putting stress on my stress on my shins and so I would put duct tape I would duct tape my feet and I would show you the top of them where I have pressure ulcers they're the size of quarters from you know how the ankle joint so the foot goes to the shin and how you move this where the tape was so tight it just created a nice ulcer right there and I just uh just kept going through it so you just use that tape to just support your ankles right so I basically cast myself and for the first 30 45 minutes the pain was excruciating but then it would go numb and I would go numb and then I saw I got through Wow did that do any long-term damage oh yeah I've been out for five years so I retired from the I did 21 years in military this time in the Air Force and I did about 16 years in the Navy how old you 43 she looks like you're 30 that's good that's good you really you look very young for your age whenever I'm stressed I get after it I think I fixed was ever bothering me so I basically over the last five years everything I've done in my life I did it be very unhealthy I've never talked about it I just kept going and it cost me pretty much I was choking my insides out adrenal issues tons of general issues thyroid issues anything with the endocrine system pretty much shut down on me a lot my organs were pretty much shutting down and I went from a guy who could run 205 miles to a guy who couldn't get a bed and the doctors were trying to search what was wrong that's why I figure out the psoas muscle no one figured it out and I hit it by accident so I I've missed two days of stretching out in five years and so what happened was all this should I did to myself this dress I under physical mental all kind of [ __ ] it just choked me out from the inside and doctors put me all kind of medication and the medication started doing the exact opposite it was kind of sure I was on um DHEA I was on some different things for my estrogen different things for my I was on anything to do with your with your endocrine system thyroid medicine get God I was on quarters all kind of [ __ ] to get my stuff I'd like just lump in my throat from like the heart was always I couldn't run down the street my body was just jacked up couldn't sleep my hope I was just down shutting down I could give you a lot more than that but just give me example I was [ __ ] dying and so I couldn't do anything I went from a guy who was this guy to a guy who can't do [ __ ] and doctors like I don't know what's wrong with you me you know your labs or this is it PTSD is it what's going on I knew what any of that [ __ ] so I sat in the bed one day and I realized man my life is over this is it but it gave me time to reflect on everything I'd accomplished I've never taken time to reflect on the kid I was to the man I am now so honestly the time I wasn't working out it was the best time I live because I got a chance to really reflect back and be proud of who I became guy never took time to do that it was like one after another get the [ __ ] after get after it get after you ain't good nothing my [ __ ] get after it get after it and I'm I got halted so anyway this process went on for a while more medication this isn't working that's not working no doctor can figure it out I'm like [ __ ] it I saw this doc about eight years before this happened he was like hey man you're so [ __ ] tight I've never seen anybody in my life as tight as you you need 50,000 hours of stretching he's doing some crazy number I like whatever stretching the you know it stretch stress is bad for you so you thought stretch was but that's just bad for you why did you think that I read some article you know a man [ __ ] [ __ ] stretching man I worked out so hard I don't have time to stress man I was 150 miles a week I was biking to work man I was getting after it man I was working a full-time job and stretching and doing that so my body was literally getting tired and tired not just from what I was doing but there's all cuz you ran this nut wasn't that man and so I said no I'm gonna try to stretch out so I don't do anything for like ten minutes or you know I don't do to a six-minute abs [ __ ] so I start stretching out one hour hour and a half long story short man I shaved my head unless every morning and that bump doesn't the back of my [ __ ] head I started realizing it was shrinking for some [ __ ] reason I don't know why because I shaved my head back and I was like it's getting smaller smaller that bump got healthier I got smaller that bump got I was like oh hold up [ __ ] what's going on that so whereas muscle started getting more and more stressed out more more relaxed and over a period of five years I'm the best shape in my damn life right now from stretching out Wow that's all it was I went from like I came in counting medications I was on now I'm on a very low dose thyroid pill period do you ever do yoga all the time man all the time and I if I were to tell somebody one thing right now man that's so as muscle and getting that hip flexor opened up because we're all stressed the [ __ ] out it was it's almost worse than others it changed my life yeah how do you say Nick Gregorius how do you say his last name the Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt from England the Greek fella he has a great quote about yoga he said yoga is a martial art you do against yourself yep it's a great way of putting it a hundred percent so what it feels like when you're in there right hundred percent and so you how many years ago was this it was five years ago anything and how long was there a period where you couldn't work out at all there was about so I always try to do something but I couldn't run hardly though I could run maybe half a mile and all that hard [ __ ] would happen in my heart would get a fit and I'll cast off what happened and I started just stretching and also I tried to pull ups every now and then but everything was just I didn't have the energy I didn't have anything I mean nothing was processing right for me so do you think that you just broke in your body you pushed it too hard hundred percent sat back in that bed that night and I had a lot of time to reflect us you know what I was actually kind of proud of myself in a very sick twisted way I even though people would understand it I had to do what I had to do and you know and I did it like I didn't tell you how I got into ultrarunning you know there's a lot of things that so I I pushed extremely hard I went way beyond what I thought was capable like my first ultra race I did I was uh I was heavier I was in Iraq you know the marcus luttrell lone survivor I was in buds I was in three hell weeks as you know as I said many times and I knew a lot of guys that died in the operation now I was at freefall school with marking the trail who is his twin brother during the operation wet wings wear market rosin on a survivor I knew market real well and I was about 200 some odd pounds and I didn't run hardly at all at this time I was a seal but I was like a bodybuilder and I did it elliptical trainer 20 minutes on Sunday all I did so I did [ __ ] that cardio stuff I was never about it until this happened so that happened and I was like man I gotta find a way to raise money for these families so I googled the I I found a foundation the Special Operations Warrior Foundation and I googled the 10 hardest races in the world I knew nothing about ultra running the first I'd ever run was 20 miles at one time and so what came up was the bad water 135 135 mile run through Death Valley in the summertime I thought was a [ __ ] stage race I know people can run her 35 miles at one time had no idea was imminent stage race would you run like 20 miles I'll camp out and then run 20 more to get her 35 miles right so I wouldn't alter runner to know ultra runner was I called the race director up Chris Kaufman of the bad water spinning he said are you an ultra runner and I was like I don't know what that is he goes have you run 100 miles in 24 hours or less I was like no but I said I'm a Navy SEAL I was in 3 Heloise I was arranged I gave him some resume he didn't give a [ __ ] he said I don't care you got qualified for my race and the deadline was up in two months for this bad water race and basically he said there's two more races you can do to qualify and I might consider you my race we select top 90 athletes in the world and you know even all true runner but I like your cause like what you're doing he said uh I come up on a Wednesday and he goes there's a race on Saturday in San Diego San Diego one day when you run around a one-mile track for 24 hours Samiha miles you get if you get 100 24 hours I will consider you in my race I did the math 14 some minute mile [ __ ] it I can do that dumb [ __ ] thinking I'll tell you that right now it was rough worst pain I've been in my entire life or this race so I have my wife that time she's not my ex-wife we go to Walmart get a blue lawn chair Ritz crackers in my licks that's what I'm gonna have for a hundred mile run so show up at the start line this race it was a you a national championships it's like the best ultra runners compete against each other to Sydney miles you can get in 24 hours and I'm this big bodybuilder looking guy but there's do it like them I would say I was at least 230 at least it may have been more than jacked yeah oh yeah I was ripped to [ __ ] up I'm a big ol chest out date I was I was jacked up there's a picture I mean he definitely didn't look like someone who could run a home run no not at all so basically I start running and I get to about mile 40 mile 50 and I'm feeling pretty good I get to mile 70 and it was the worst pain of my life i sat down this blue lawn chair at Mile 70 and my the rich crackers after mile 20 became wrist cracker bong sky wasn't hydrating correctly I don't know what to do I was drinking mile Plex for my nutrition because I couldn't eat these rich crackers have very minimal water if any at all and I was just dying so I sat down this blue lawn chair as I was watching lies runners go around in this circle and I was all dizzy and lightheaded hadn't gone in the bathroom it's been about 12 hours I went 70 miles about 12 hours which is good and I looked at my ex-wife now and I was like I am [ __ ] I started seeing like three of her and once my body stopped my mind just went off and I had to go to the bathroom and the bathroom is like it's like 20 feet away from me if that not Cooney and so I sat there and pee blood down my leg and start crapping up my back and for 30 miles to go I am my feet were broken I was just in the worst shape because once you stopped running not running like that I mean I didn't run in almost a year I was just doing body building stuff and 20 minutes on the elliptical trainer no running at all I probably ran no [ __ ] no [ __ ] no more than 50 miles the whole year that wasn't my thing I want it to be like jacked you know I didn't want to be cardio guy I want to be ripped big Navy SEAL guy and um in the day before this race is funny this guy named Joe Burns who put me through my hell weeks a SIL guy he's one of the hardest guys out there he was in the gym the Friday before I did this race and he was doing a full body squats deadlifts power cleans I get my own you know he he's a guy that proved me to do this race you know he gave me the approval to go do this race and signed off on it so I'm in the gym I went in there did a full-body hardcore squats deadlifts and everything with this guy because I knew he was gonna come watch me in this race so I've always been about all right man you're gonna see me coming here and Jack this weight and the more you watch me do a hundred mile run we can think about that so basically I paid for it so at my so he came out there with my favorite thing chocolate you know mini doughnuts because he knew my story of my past life and brought the six minute doughnuts out there and I'll have my hat pulled down and at Mile 70 men it was torturous and with blood down my leg and 30 miles to go I started reaching the cookie jars man I started pulling off all kind of stuff I reached in my mind and a lot of us when we have bad times in life even the hardest person where we forget how badass we are during that hard time I have a thing where I take a couple seconds to reflect on I hang on man you've meant to been through this you've been through that you overcame this overcame that I don't ever close my mind to the fact that this can't be done and I knew I had to get up I need nutrition I need hydration I need to get stop being dizzy so that's the first thing I did I didn't panic gonna have 30 more miles to go to get I start about the process slowly but surely I was able to stand up and I was literally hobbling around this track we're just walking no running at all I couldn't run my feet were in the worst pain it's the worst pain I've been in my entire life nothing in any training is even a comparable to this last 30 miles and what happened was my ex-wife looked at me and she's like man you're this we agreed I'm not gonna make the time I was going way too slow and at that time at mile 81 something clicked that I'll never probably be able to do again where my mind body spirit soul everything disconnected and my mind knew I wasn't [ __ ] around anymore it knew it wasn't gonna quit it knew that guy was dead and buried and gone and I was gonna die out here on this [ __ ] Walmart for whatever reason why I was gonna get through this [ __ ] I didn't give a damn it made no there was no [ __ ] crowds there was no trophy at the end there was I wasn't even in a race in my mind there was it was nothing it weren't about nothing there was no nothing it was a bunch of people who didn't know who the [ __ ] I was it was me against me and I used all these different dark places to start bringing out light and just [ __ ] going deeper and deeper in it running the next 20 miles around 101 miles and I ran the next 20 miles ran at about a 1030 pace and I did 101 miles in 18 hours and 56 minutes sat back down that blue port-a-potty now my chair that got from Walmart and that's when the body realized I was done and this great feeling came over me but also the worst pain in my life I that's when I took a humongous [ __ ] on myself literally like I like a [ __ ] log up my [ __ ] back piss so much blood down and my wife was she was a nurse and she was freaked out I couldn't get up I couldn't stand up she backed this Camry on the knoll of the grassy area I was at and we were both lifters at the time so she was decently strong I put my arms around her neck she got me to the backseat of the car that the windows down cos smelled like horrible [ __ ] and I had this poncho line because November in San Diego so I'm sitting there Jack him in the back his car and she was terrified anything dr. Anita that's take me home so we look in the second story or the second deck of this apartment complex in San Diego I got to the first deck so I get a car and I could stand up but with my arms on her neck so just leaning down I was gonna pass out got to the second or I got to the first deck went down just couldn't stand up anymore got around her neck worked up my way up the railing gamma-gamma I was on her neck again walked to the kitchen area which is right in the front door I was laying on a poncho liner crap was everywhere I managed she helped me manage to get into the toilet into the tub and it's like dirt was coming on my penis this looked horrible just just that grossly in the world it was worst pain I can ever ever ever be in in my life and the craziest thing I tell your story because it's right now I'm not sadistic I'm not crazy people may think that any way they may want to put a title on me after hearing me because it makes them feel better because they think wow this guy must be some special or just [ __ ] up crazy dude no I'm a guy that came from nothing anybody's capable of doing [ __ ] like this anybody and I sat in that tub she's put the water on me she called my mom up and my mom was dating a doctor at the time the doctor he actually said you need to get him to a hospital now she came back in all I want to do is call Chris Koster on the phone the race director of bad waters I [ __ ] did it so she some taken to doctor I said no let me sit here enjoy this pain she said what are you talking about I said you don't I go I need to go to the doctor I realize that but I never thought it was humanly possible to do what I did I went 70 miles in at 70 miles I was dead I was at a hundred percent what I thought what I thought was 100% I went 30 I went 31 more miles after being in the worst physical shape I've ever been in in my life and all that all that pain and suffering and thing was going through my [ __ ] body and I sat in that tub and the waters hitting me it was the most amazing feeling of accomplishment and I want to be numb I want people to give me drugs and numbness [ __ ] pain I wanted to I did this however as crazy as it sounds it was the most amazing moment of my entire life to overcome such to come from this kid who was mentally torturing something was torture is talk to this kid - Skyy now who was able to overcome such amazing odds and obstacles and I called Chris cost him up the race director of bad water and he said the idea of a 24-hour race is to run 24 hours you really ran 19 and he put doubt in my mind that he was that mean - bad water so a month later or so about a month and half later I went this race called the hurt 100 so hundred mile race in Hawaii 26,000 feet of climb was all he said that's all he said that's so crazy I mean he's a hardcore dude but he didn't know how [ __ ] up I was right and he said he didn't say well you know I can't say no I might let you win he put enough doubt in my mind and say man I got to do more so I was broken I was broken bad and like how long does it take you to recover physically the funniest thing about this I'll tell a story very often I had signed up for I'm getting to that answer it's right now I'm in deployment and me and my wife my mom signed up for the first Las Vegas Marathon down the strip of Las Vegas and that isn't happened so I ran 100 miles before I ran a marathon two weeks later roughly December 5th was this marathon that we all signed up for I couldn't walk I could not walk I was [ __ ] up so it's ten days or two weeks after this 100 mile in one race I did this marathon December 5th Las Vegas I said you know it's the first one I can't run maybe I can walk with my mom so I tried to go out this little Knoll around our grassy area in San Diego I tried to run legs were broken I said [ __ ] I can't even I'm jacked can't do [ __ ] so I said you know what maybe I'll watch you guys do the marathon and I'll cheer you guys on whatever I said I'll try walk with my mom December 5th happened that gun went off 2005 14 days after I broke myself off and I qualified for the Boston Marathon around 308 that's crazy and what's funny about I know people here says [ __ ] even when I tell you the story I dropped I want to drop so many names google it look it up I don't give a [ __ ] like almost seems like I'm making my own story up it does it almost seems like it to you it does I cannot tell it if I were to hear somebody I said let's you know just do you Joe Rogan's podcast I heard some black dude from [ __ ] Brazilian hand talking about I this happened this happened three weeks Ranger school ran a hundred miles broke my feet broke my body I'm like this man he's the biggest [ __ ] liar on the planet or ain't nobody know [ __ ] even why I tell my story it almost sounds like some made-up [ __ ] so yes crazies you ran a hundred miles before you ever ran a marathon right then you didn't run again at all and he's still qualified for the Boston Marathon so you ran a 308 right for the first marathon you ever did ever did two weeks after you ran a hundred miles right with no training and nothing in between but it gets better than that you can see my training log to actually post it up so that's when I started training for the hurt 100 so basically what happened was after that I had about four weeks what did it feel like to run that 308 if you could barely walk when that gun went off something went off in my head and I didn't feel that much pain at all afterwards I did but something happened where I was like the gun went off and that thing came back like all right man what if because I want to qualify for Boston that was my goal but I was I was jacked up you know and I and I and I didn't run as much that sort of at all over my Iraq training I hit the weights and but my job but but my goal was my son that forward a year early I want to qualify for Boston which was a three 10:59 and I was like what if you can qualify for Boston mayor and so we wit helped me out I spent 101 miles what the [ __ ] is 26 miles to me now so the mindset going into it was like I ran 75 more miles in this so I use it to my advantage so after that happened I ran but my feet pretty much broken I would go to the physical therapist and they had this compression tape compressing tape help because I'm my feet were pretty bad off and I would run 7080 hundred mile weeks and then I went to the hurt 100 race in Hawaii 26,000 feet of climbing over 100 miles probably one of the top five hardest hundred mile races in the world I wouldn't even a real runner yeah I baked a lot of miles by the last the last but two and a half about two months but I want a runner went out there and got through the race did in 33 hours with a ninth place finisher not many people finished that that year and I qualified for bad water and got in and I went on to lose weight and train hard and I got fifth my first year I went back my second year and got there when you say you went you lost weight like what were you eventually way in so I went to the race about 190 we lost quite a bit yeah bodybuilding time right that's over a short period of time right how did you lose all that way once again I I just worked out hard I stopped taking my protein so much I got off I was on this stuff called a nitro tech and I got off all the protein stuff I started I stopped hitting the weights so hard and I just became a running fool became the Black Forest got man pretty much pretty simple man that's what happened now when you say you were using compression tape on your feet and that your feet were jacked up what was the extent of the injuries so basically because of my pronation that I never figured out cuz my soul has muscles I always had issues with stretch fractures shin splints so I put a lot of pressure on the inside of my ankles and so that there's this tendon that goes up the backside of your I don't know if it's your fibula my backside that of that little bone backs out your foot it goes right up beside that lot right alongside that bone and that thing was just so fluid up on both sides that even this flexing my foot was just killing me so I when you can you know when you cast that thing up casting my feet always helped me out because it it it locked my foot into a position that wouldn't made me pronate as much so between the casting of that and if you watched the a bad water video of 2006 you see me crossing the finish line with this compression tape literally like flying on my ankles because I went to the race with compression tape on my ankles and so basically I'd have that on my you know on my ankles I had inserts in my you know in my shoes and also this wedge on the back heel of my left foot so then it would keep me from pronating that heel so much so I had all that on just to go around and I ran my ass off and went to bad water 2006 and with compression tape on my feet and walked a lot but I got third place do you always run with regular running shoes I do yeah so now I don't have those issues anymore all the stretching has opened my body up to where I know how it should have been so my alignment is pretty good it's not perfect so now I just run in regular running shoes now no no more compression tape no more none that stuff so if you see now if you look down there you'll see they can press it up and you'll see my ex-wife here in a second taking their compression tape off of me she's doing it right now you see her right now you know she said tape yeah so that's the tape I didn't have to wear every day of my life to run Wow so as you see the story may be kind of unbelievable but there's some proof right there so that's how I was so painful yeah I was pretty [ __ ] up as you see right now me trying to get all man yeah I'm pretty destroyed right there what is the most amount of miles you've ever run at one time yeah two hundred and five and thirty nine hours Wow non-stop whoo yeah I've had quite a few people on I've met quite a few people now over the last year so that have run ultras Courtney doe Walter you know she is she won the Moab okay yeah I heard my 40 rather heard about yes she she beat all the men by 22 miles something like that some crazy things she was first place winner she beat everybody else second place one word and with her I mean you would never believe it wouldn't talk to her she seemed so normal right she drinks beer and eats nachos needs candy ultrarunner man she's just silly and she's fun yep and there's no demon there I like waiting to meet a demon right you know I'm like where's your demon like how are you getting through her demons a quiet demon right it's it's there it has to be okay there's something there has to be there's no other people that everybody I know that that can do that as a demon a lot of us don't want admit to [ __ ] yeah we got him a hundred percent it has to be yeah so when you do this and you you qualify and you do that race in Hawaii right they just let you in after that no so the race in Hawaii yeah I actually called the race jerk threw up and there wasn't like a big time like I had to have 100-mile race I believe as I had and so you know 100-mile you did the boss of merit or you did the Vegas marathon yeah so I did a hundred mile 101 miles the Vegas marathon went to hurt 100 did that hundred mile ER and all this is in a very short amount of time yeah so November was the first time jamala December was the 26 mile or not in Las Vegas January was the next hundred miles on Hawaii you know [ __ ] crazy that is like say if I was your friend and I called you up on October 20th I go hey man how many times you run like run every night I see something crazy I'm gonna pull it up or not but if you can pull my race schedule for 2007 this pull up David Goggins race results you can see something real crazy in a second they saying this is good and I gotta show you proof because why I know my story doesn't make any sense but this look at the dates of these races and we're gonna show it to you in a second it's um just look at the hundred miles and 15 hours back-to-back weekends how many weekends there were between races so if you look right here you can't really see it so he's look at 2007 yeah go all the way down keep on going 2007 steals races there and do that okay get to right there so hundred mile or Hawaii oh gee looked up first two weeks later three weeks later another one that's 50-miler a 50-miler a month later then looking at what 14 days later another 50k 50-miler month later they look at less than a month another 50-miler 53 milder in June July was another 100 miler bad water was literally reached that water was a month after I did that hundred mile or 135 Marlette Ville was less than a month after bad water the plane 100 was three weeks after Leadville Angels crest was to attend date a week after that energy modeler the bare 100 was wet thirteen days after that hundred mile or she and then I ran the two hundred and it said to her and three point five but I didn't ran toward its 205 miles around there but what's not in there was that McNaughton race I did in two thousand or fifty mile race I also did in two thousand seven that wasn't lifted so that was just my 2007 year that's insane yeah so do you think that is what [ __ ] your body up no no no because I I still run the same mileage now well [ __ ] my body up was hell week really oh yeah you don't go through three hell weeks in one year so I so what happened was when I realized that my body is really jacked up was I went I was a big-time squatter loved squatting and I went through the first hell week got messed up ii hope you got all the way through then throw hope we could got all the way through and my third hell we could hit me that guy died on Thursday and then that hell weekend and I graduated pulmonary edema it was a code name was John stop it code is [ __ ] hell week the Pacific Oceans never warm and it rained the whole time the whole time is rain and he pretty much just drown on his own fluid pretty much we were in the pool doing some evolution he sunk to the bottom his temperature was hot he missed a lot of hell week for getting pulled out for different stuff he wouldn't go quit and I'm heating up dying he'll week but um yeah so anyway after hell week ended I want to go back to the gym you know so second phase happened I face like I can get back in the gym so I jacking my weight I love jack and weight and I realized I couldn't squat so I went from squatting a lot to I couldn't even squat the bark and my lower back was all [ __ ] up I was like I don't know what's going on it was cuz this this muscle so inhale week your hip flexors are so and I went through so many of them so fast and so the hardest part of buds I went through three times not not the healthy part yes one the hardest parts but it was the initial part of the where everybody sees on TV the log PT to surf torture the dad gone boats over your head law all that [ __ ] I went through that person three times in one year and over a period of time my hip flexors got so tight that is jacked me up it jacked me up for my hip flexor so so always being so cold and so stressed out and everything led up to it but this really was the part that I noticed I could squat before hell week or before my first time going to buds after after buds I couldn't I couldn't squat anymore do you just think it might just be because your body was exhausted no cuz I for 12 years so I would I would go back and tough it out like like with Joe burns he was squatting so I said [ __ ] I almost caught with Joe burns but I just couldn't squat cuz that that muscle was attached here at t12 so what was it doing - is it locking up it was pulling and so it made my hips feel like I couldn't sink my ass oh I couldn't sink so his incredible pain and then with the weight pushing me down and then trying to push up the pain was just is just too much so so this is all range of motion is always in motion issues yeah Wow that that's an important thing for my friend cam Haynes who doesn't stretch he's another friend of mine who runs ultra races he ran that moab 240 he's run the bigfoot 205 he's run a few of those right um i know he's listening go stretch dude yes support man it was especially if you work in that hard right if you're doing that much yeah you're you're definitely locking up he could barely touch his toes yeah that's not a good thing that's not good no no it comes back to hurt you inside pretty soon now how flexible you now cuz I would imagine you probably a [ __ ] ballerina at this point because sad when your brain I'm trying to get there I'm trying to get there so I stretch every night for at least two hours there's a thing that people said that it always pissed me off like because I'm pretty flexible they said oh you're naturally flexible people have a natural threshold like oh they don't like a doctor told me that I go you don't know what you're talking about I'm like you don't know what you talk about cuz most people don't push themselves past that pain that stretch pain alright people want to put a title on your mask easy for them oh yes exactly natural exactly now you don't work hard enough [ __ ] yeah people built like chimps aren't usually flexible right you have to you have to force yourself to do that's right and I know it because I had a friend my friend Tom our dog nah he was a football player Jack big fick dude terrible flexibility was taking Taekwondo with me and over the course of a couple years I saw that dude eventually develop a full split there you go and he just did it through his mind yes was everybody else was done training that guy would be on the mat constantly stretch and always working out cuz he had built his body up so strong through all those years of squatting and lifting yeah that he just you know he was all tense everything was just like this super powerful right but all like very tense that's why I stopped you know that's why I never stretched because I wanted that strength yeah yeah you want that tight muscle but no I don't think it is stupid yeah I think you're not supposed to stretch before you do big physical activities because I think it does like weaken you somewhat but I don't think being flexible overall makes you weak or not at all yeah what certainly doesn't from martial arts because you need that flexibility to have leg dexterity to be able to kick right it's got to be fluid where it's not tightened up by the restriction of the motion of your body I get it it's truth I just think people are for whatever reason and I'm one of those drone on too much about yoga I'm like one of those vegans it's like you got to do it man right he's trying I get it knowing like a born-again Christian or something I'm getting that way now man that way now for anybody does anything hard like you know if you do anything like with weightlifting type [ __ ] or martial arts type [ __ ] where it's just everything's explosion its lifting it's heavy push push push right yoga just will balance your [ __ ] out yeah well yeah really well man and there's all these people that resist it like there was some article recently that it was something along the lines of hot yoga is just trendy nonsense I've read that and then even in the article it talked about that there might be some benefits in terms of like the strengthening your arteries and they didn't even mention heat-shock proteins is a study going on right now I believe it's at Harvard one of my friends was telling me about it where they're they're trying to find the benefits of 90 minute hot yoga classes because they think it might mirror the observed benefits of sauna which they already know for a fact has big benefits because of your body producing heat shock proteins to deal with the heat right that's why I put that sauna in here man I go in that [ __ ] all the time well no one can tell me doesn't work that's big it's proof positive you changed my life it wasn't a medication or this or a dress it was stretching yeah it was yoga stretching all that stuff combined changed it well I just think it balances out your body in those static poses where you're just holding the pose and it just it works you out in a weird way that one's a person you just don't get lifting weights or hitting the bag or anything out you're just not gonna get that that kind of working out I can't agree with you more it's so difficult crazy get your ass off and [ __ ] and you're like this is like the silent struggle it's humbling nobody knows it's like if you see like two doorways right and one of them is like [ __ ] CT Ollie Fletcher's [ __ ] super pump iron addicts gym which is hard work and then right next to it is the yoga studio you're like well once you get done with all that hard work you'll go over to that yoga studio no there's two different kinds of hard work going on it's no joke two different kinds of hard work yes sir so what do you do now in terms of like you got over this five years ago you're in this bad situation when your body's not working right now everything's working great again well I had two heart surgeries also whoa yeah so you know your heart so I had a hole in it so you know you're not supposed to have a hole in your heart and be a seal and it reborn with it I was born with it it went undetected and me pushing so hard so around in 2009 I was trying to first race across America and I just couldn't go anymore another pitfall in my life was the hole and I was pretty much off active duty steel for three years yeah you know I had two hearts for them trying to fix it so the hole was significantly large look how big that they say it was as big as a quarter now Mike Holly Hill is it big as a quarter yeah that's a pretty big hole in your heart because they had to helix patches I'm like that's impossible that the helix patches they're in my heart so the two stents what is a helix patch it is like a little mesh very like what they do for hernias like something maybe something like that so they went through my femoral artery and they placed this patch but to go through your artery yeah everything my femoral artery yeah looking with a camera yeah whoa so what no the cameras down through my throat whoa and they put this catheter through my femoral artery get went to my heart they they went and they took this helix patch they place it in there and then they found out six months later that the hole wasn't covered up enough yet because always I mean in the huge patch was very damn big so they put it go back in there in 2010 how does the patch adhere to your heart I guess your heart heals around the patch so but how did they stick it in place I I guess they put it with the holes at uh-huh and then it kind of like inflates oh wow the hole is that and then that that thing goes in there and then it kind of covers a hole and in the heart so there's two things in my heart right now that the heart just kind of covered up whoa okay so there you go Jamie's got an image of it for us whoa so so it's attached to this little probe right and then they put it over the area where the injury is Wow that's insane yeah atrial septum defect if I had atrial septal defect so basically everything I had done I then got from medicine oh [ __ ] you do I'll be done that's so crazy that they could do that yeah so I was out for I was off-duty for three years so I stuck I was in a recruiting area for three years trying to get back on active duty and that was my life for three years so they put that patch in yep and now your heart's 100% 100% it sounds percent Wow yeah that's incredible yeah I was losing you know blood and I was just I was a bad off it's just amazing that you were able to do all that with a hole in your heart that's what the doctors were saying you know because eight naw I was a seal so when I went in and the doctor that found the hole are like so they'd gave me EKGs all this stuff once again may you after I ran like 205 miles you know Ryan made you're in great shape I'm like man I just don't feel good like walking up the stairs this making me jacked up so the doctor doc Shrek he's like you know gave me he can go to the doctor get an echocardiogram so I'm in there getting echocardiogram just chilling out in there and the guys talking to him he has his little wand in my heart we're bullshitting about stuff and he when people get quiet [ __ ] not good man so he's in there this has one of my heart chilling out yeah man we doing yeah you know what's going on now like he says I'll be right back he goes and gets a doctor doctor comes in puts thing I'm a heart the doctor gets another doctor now I'm just freaking the [ __ ] out I'm like okay cuz when it comes to your heart that was a big deal so they come back in they say hey we can stop the echocardiogram I mean he talked you out in the hallway you have a hole in your heart and the guy didn't know that I was he knew I was Navy god I don't think he was a seal because not me black guys are seals and he had a conversation about you know we gotta fix this real quick I said yeah I mean then I came up that I was the seal he said man you could have died jumping you could die diving you could have died into all this stuff cuz basically the hole in your heart if it gets plugged with something like anything like you know let's say you get a bubble from diving or something like that you got died right so I I I call it luck I call it look so I I got through two surgeries they put me back on they give you the first one yeah and when do they realize that it's not done not good enough so they take you back and you get a bubble study a bubble test so it's so they like literally send bubbles that way safe bubbles that way to see if the bubble goes through your heart so they have this this echocardiogram again and they hook you up I think to ID or something like that and they throw these bubbles through your heart and they see if it goes through after six months when I should've been healed up the bubble went through so had to tell me then hey we got a you know you're not you're not good to go so I had to take a year before I have another surgery because because that patch had to be completely completely healed so they can go back in time you knew you had a hole right so so then you add a hole because of the heart surgery probably all this time like when you're waiting for it details you know you have an extra hole yes I don't have a hole yes what were you allowed to do with your body then well at that time they go you know do how you feel comfortable and so you know the hole is not going to kill you right now but you can't die if you can't jump you pretty much wouldn't steal anymore so I was a recruiter for a period of time so basically I was crazy about that is before my second surgery I was actually training for Delta Force I was I wanted to go to Delta and I was rucking ruck running a lot and before my second truck running I mean you're running with a package I pack on my back with some weight on how heavy is the pack 50 60 pounds and you run with that on well you're supposed to hike or hump like ruck hopping right I ran with it because I was you know I that's what I did right so the date of the day of the day of heart surgery I did a ruck run Jesus because I knew I was gonna be out of commission for a while so [ __ ] it matter get my last one in dude Jesus Christ all I could do I have my training launch after my second heart surgery all I could do was walk so I became an ultra Walker I walked my [ __ ] ass off and I over a period of time it took a year for that thing to heal up in the hill you know my first bubble study after my second heart surgery came back negative or positive the bubble went through again oh no and they're gonna crack me open oh man over that period of time my heart healed around that thing nicely and I passed a second bubble test so the first bubble test was how long after a year it was so the first bubble test after the first surgery was six months and then you had to go through a full six months after that variety heal then you have the second heart surgery and when does the bubble test fail after the second heart surgery it was about six months Jesus Christ and they said and the doctor looked at me and said you know I'm sorry to inform you maybe we have to crack your chest open the next time they're really getting there and so I sat back thinking this could be a third heart surgery and then that one they said we have to wait for six months to see if this thing's gonna close up right yeah I came back thinking man I'm about to get cracked the [ __ ] open and that bubble got pinned up man Wow when they go through maybe forced it through with your mind it may add something to visualize holy [ __ ] man that is crazy yeah it's crazy one on a ruck run with a hole in your heart - well I did it for several years I said [ __ ] it keep on going man that's amazing now after all said and done everything's good now yeah everything's I mean I'm sure supposed to pop up in my [ __ ] ass not to do that you know everything's good right now I'm always waiting for the next thing to pop up and I hang on the same way I was attack it but yeah I said right now I'm in the best shape my 43 years old just turned 43 February 17th I am in the best shape my life I'm not knocking on wood because life [ __ ] it life comes at you dude so right [ __ ] knocking on wood come at me I mean I would think that you would be a go-to guy for injuries yeah I give anybody had a ball I've had them all I found when you broke the world record for chin-ups didn't you rip your arm apart pull-ups yeah so if you pull up the picture man there's a picture of my hand you'll see I'll know what is it pull ups are so pull ups are here hands out hands out and chin ups our hands right hands forward so I failed three times before I finally got it the third time and I the first time I ripped the [ __ ] on my forearm and then the second time you'll see there's a picture of my hand and it it's a third-degree burn so that's my hand oh Jesus man what in the [ __ ] is going to look at you a bit by a wolf so what's funny about that as you see that uh that doesn't create after one pull-up so if you can imagine the pain of because you know you have one contact point that's it mmm you like running you can overcome it cuz it these big giant legs and right it's different when you have these little fragile punk-ass hands touching the bar no imagine four thousand thirty pull-ups how many times you're coming that bar coming off right now way 207 pounds at the time so I was I was a bigger guy I'm like 195 or 185 now so I was almost 22 pounds heavier so I was a lot bigger than I am right there ma'am you look pretty get that [ __ ] man so you were doing it in sets of five sets of five so as you see I have these different people who are witnessing you you have to have your your your number there to make sure that you're you know qualified for the Guinness Book of World Record that's 1450 I have a long way to govern another four thousand and fifteen pull-ups to go hurt Jesus Christ so yeah and how long did you do this over 24 hours it was seven so I brought it at 17 Wow and I was [ __ ] over it what did it feel like in the last chin up you know what actually here's a video that we have and I was chasing this guy named Steven Highland so this guy named Steven Highland had the record and the video is my last three pulls for broke the record I'm talking so much [ __ ] there's another [ __ ] I'm like hey [ __ ] you thought was good get it huh I told you [ __ ] ass [ __ ] I'm coming after you I'm here now is this me talking [ __ ] it's a cool video but I felt um I felt nothing I was just happy I have to do anymore I just 67,000 pull-ups in nine months G in training first record for 4000 and the failures so I I did the first time in September failed miserably on this today shot the twenty five hundred and eighty eight or something like that film is me for millions of people two months later November tried again failed again two months later in January 19th I finally [ __ ] got it so after I got it wasn't like I'm happy it was like I gotta do more [ __ ] pull-ups anymore Roger that so it was I had a [ __ ] check that [ __ ] but you were doing them when I got here today you know why cuz now it's a party dude I don't like doing this we could get somebody knocks him out you don't like doing them so you got to do them that's my whole life isn't it like someone someone gets drunk on a certain whiskey like if they smell it they'll get disgusted like like Jagermeister or something like that they smell it no oh right is that what it's like with you chin ups along with envelopes with a lot of a lot of things yeah right now I'm like running out like and people don't believe it but you know I was I was a big guy twice in my life so hence the reason why I just don't like running man it hurts it's brutal it sucks going out and I'm gonna be gone for two hours or I'm gonna be going 49 hours right running on a one mile track [ __ ] I'm not crazy man it sucks I mean you know people put me in this category of you must be some crazy guy who loves it no man no that's why I do it though that's the only way to couch your [ __ ] brain man I want me to get hard a lot people take these classes on mental toughness I even steals in the class about visualization self-talk eat an elephant one by that time breathing control Roger that you gotta put yourself in hellacious situation it's a lifestyle how are you going to react how are you gonna react all that training goes out the [ __ ] door when you're in the [ __ ] cold water and you're [ __ ] miserable it's the first hour of a hundred thirty hours of hell week and that first wave goes over your head and you're the codis you've been in your life and your mind goes from our one to our one [ __ ] thirty all that [ __ ] self talking [ __ ] dude you ain't think about anything about getting the [ __ ] out of here but if you live this [ __ ] on a daily basis and you know how to calm your mind down this self-talk will help all that stuff will help but usually we react we have pain we have suffering we react and we react about get the [ __ ] out of here we got to go it's those people were able to control that [ __ ] feeling and [ __ ] flight and say no I'm a [ __ ] there's a way through this it's not going to be your forever I'm not cold right now I let the three of them I'm not cold now I'm in a nice warm studio with you you got to think about that [ __ ] it's just going to end it's going to end but we don't know that we don't think that at that time it's gonna last forever and then you get to sit back on Friday there by walking across the you know back on the grinder all the 16 17 guys that graduated Hill week and you a chance to watch these guys victorious and then you get the chance think about that you take that hot warm shower first thing that comes to your [ __ ] minds why the [ __ ] that I quit so what keeps me going I've quit several things I know what's on the back end the [ __ ] quitting it's a lifetime of thinking about why [ __ ] did I do that and I ain't [ __ ] doing that there's something about talking to a guy like you that a lot of people hope that you're gonna say some magic thing that's gonna click in their brain everybody gets change who they are like what is it what is the thing that's why people go to these self-help conferences and they take these classes and they hope that someone's gonna say something that changes the way their mind works it's hilarious to me it is it's kind of hilarious to me too but what is also hilarious is that what you're saying is that you have to do those things you have to suffer you have to live in it you have to be comfortable in it and then maybe some of that [ __ ] will help you a little bit along the way period and I went to I was a when I was a still recruiter I got invited to MIT smart ass [ __ ] there man I'm not that I miss a garanimal Dumber knuckle-dragger and there was this guy that I forget his name but he was like the top head head guy old white guy you know all genius doubt and we were on this panel and they were asking us all these questions about the mind mental toughness and [ __ ] he was answering them and I wasn't answering any questions now I'll never forget he was just answering off of theory mmm he never put his [ __ ] ass and [ __ ] you read a bunch of [ __ ] books and you think that you know how the [ __ ] mind works and [ __ ] I've gone through hell just a kid and then all the way up until now right so I know so that theory is [ __ ] yeah there's a lot of good stuff out there you can read from people but I had lived hell and when you put yourself in hell that's the only time you can figure out how the [ __ ] to get through that [ __ ] you can't you can't read somebody else's book about some theory on how to do [ __ ] some guy who was set up in there a nice warm office and read and wrote some book with a nice cup of coffee in the [ __ ] hand no I want to see that guy who put immersed himself in [ __ ] hell and he thought about quitting and leaving him and his wife and his kids and why am I here is it is it worth it all this crazy [ __ ] it still said if I not a way to get through it so basically that's that's the bottom line of it all we all want to read about how we can quickly get somewhere that's why that six-minute abs and also it's so powerful did you make it some results from it they're not permanent the permanent result comes from you [ __ ] I say it all time you have to suffer you have to make that a tattoo on your [ __ ] brain so when that hard time comes again you don't forget it you may forget it for a second but you can go back in the cookie jar call it it's a it's something that we've all indoors I call it the cookie jar and we often forget how hard we are but you got reflect back take a cup of sighs reflect I've been through this I've been through that and then remind yourself I'm a bad [ __ ] and then you can get do that [ __ ] but if you don't believe it you ever endured [ __ ] you're just blowing smoke man and you're not gonna get to anything what was this guy saying look what was his theories that he was throwing out there his theories was about I forget exactly what it was was there some about what the mind does under stress and how we can't he said how we can't do something and I did it I did what he said we couldn't do like what was he saying he couldn't do it was somebody if you're born if you're born a certain way somebody if you're born a certain way you can't become this way it was totally saying that would Who I am now like I had to be born with some not genetic power or some some gift from God but I had to have some kind of special gift had to have some kinda special gift I forget what set me off but was that we had to be - to be somewhere you had to be born with it what was the concept and I know what I was born with and I know the battle that I had in my mind so when he said it is sad to look at my face and some on the crowd ask me a question yeah I totally count addicted everything he said and I was like nah man I mean I [ __ ] know for a fact that you can be this [ __ ] up dude like really [ __ ] up dude and with the right mindset it is it sounds so easy with the right mindset doesn't sound easy it's know what you're saying it sounds very simplistic answer right you can you can't but you have to go into the dark chambers that we often shut off and you got to open them up you can open up and fight that [ __ ] demon get in there talk to that [ __ ] and say what's up and we often take that we all like to take this four-lane highway the easy highway has has [ __ ] signs it has restaurants we all loved that four-lane highway we always step over the shovel and all I did was I picked up that [ __ ] shovel and that shovel I made my own path and you may have big boulders and [ __ ] they may be getting towards and miles up the road faster than you but going through this path of life this journey over here that you make yourself that's incredibly difficult but it comes out to the other end of that [ __ ] is some glorious [ __ ] that you can't even explain to people and we're afraid bottom line is most of us even the people have all these theories and [ __ ] it's easier to accept the fact that I'm just not good enough I wasn't made to do that and yeah some of us can't be LeBron [ __ ] James but I'll tell you right now man we can do a lot of [ __ ] when it comes to this pure long guts and willpower and getting through [ __ ] we have a lot more with a lot more and we think we have yeah the problem with a guy like that with his theory is his theories of based on results and those results are based on human beings and most human beings there's certain people that are born with certain gifts like a guy like LeBron James is a physical talent you know John Jones and MMA obviously physical talent but there's when you look at someone who's super successful you always assume that it has to be because of some sort of physical gifts because people look at themselves and I'm sure this doctor this old dude probably had like a little gut and probably exactly I looked a little tiny arms weak shoulders and probably thought well there's certain people that are just mesomorphic and probably broke it down all these scientific terms right you know they just have a fast twitch muscle fibers and they'll say all this crazy [ __ ] that is true at the very highest levels of the winners right but it doesn't mean that you can't become that no it just means that it's too painful for most people to go through so very few people ever get there so if you look at the actual results he would be correct but he's not correct because he doesn't take the shovel exactly that's not the more the story does not some easy lit up streetlights right half with nice smooth roads right it's a difficult [ __ ] where you're gonna fail and you're gonna be in your head you could be saying I'm not good enough and it's how you get through that is how you get through that on a daily basis when that thing is say man I'm 43 I've done so much you start to become civilized the refrigerator gets full you start getting making money and you start I'm not getting cold anymore I'm retired what's in at forty people shouldn't be playing basketball or football or beating them up you start to believe this [ __ ] and it becomes in your [ __ ] mind like there's people who are retiring you know at 40-something years or 37 years old at 43 I'm still putting a hundred-mile weeks still doing thousands of pull-ups thousands of push-ups because I'm not allowing myself to become civilized the worst didn't happen to a man's become civilized you lose that [ __ ] fight you you you you lose that why the [ __ ] am i doing this [ __ ] I'm good you ain't good man you ain't never [ __ ] arrived and that's just my mentality you may have more but you'd never [ __ ] arrive you want to be uncommon a most uncommon people period uncommon amongst uncommon people is one of the greatest ways to put it that's it like if you're if you're like for me what got me in trouble with the Navy SEALs is I want to be one so bad so bad I fought my ass off yeah I saw them as uncommon people very uncommon but once you become a Navy SEAL you're all Navy SEALs so guess what happens your [ __ ] common again I wanted to be uncommon amongst uncommon people I want it to be the guy I don't care if you [ __ ] like knock if you understand me I didn't give a [ __ ] once I went through this [ __ ] journeys path of life you ain't got in a whole bunch of [ __ ] guys that don't [ __ ] like me I don't give a [ __ ] I'm a warrior period who's like I've been a lot more combat to me a Warriors not always that words a [ __ ] who says hey I'm here again today I'm here again tomorrow gonna be here the next day I'm 50 years old I'm still [ __ ] getting after it it's a person that puts no [ __ ] limit on what's possible and that's what got me in trouble like that's why I went to Ranger School as a seal that's why I try to go to Delta Force twice you know I bet I've been through all these different training programs cuz I was looking for in the military what I saw is in the training these people get their ass handed to him after they get out a lot of them get civilized I always wanted to go back in the training and I we were always I want to go back to war in the war was in that training program where you see guys you can quit guys who are brutal guys who are suffering guys who are you go so as a seal you don't volunteer for Ranger school I did I put in seven chicks got turned down I get you know got accepted I went at 28 29 years old and they go why did you go because I started becoming civilized I started becoming complacent I I needed to get my [ __ ] ass kicked again and when you go as a seal going down to it you have no rank and Ranger school you could be a major you're just [ __ ] Joe Brown you're nobody and you're not eating you're not sleeping so I always would put myself I would immerse myself and [ __ ] like that even IRA climb the ladder and I intentionally fall back down that [ __ ] to say all right man getting soft dude getting soft kick your [ __ ] ass again and I you know it's kind of process did you find resistance from that amongst other guys that didn't like to make that you were making them uncomfortable because that is something that people there's a natural instinct that people have when someone's working harder than them to somehow another diminish that person well I know that a lot of guys don't like me for a lot of reasons and I realize that I am a guy that doesn't care if you like me or not and when you're an alpha male and you're against other alpha males and we eat our own alpha males eat their own now I love that [ __ ] let's [ __ ] go man I want to eat a man I'm all about that kind of mentality but I was sometimes take it to another level now I went part of a of a good old boy network I don't wanna be part I want to be David [ __ ] gaga for too long in my life and it got me in trouble for time I left I wanted to be accepted growing up I lied I [ __ ] did what I could for if you [ __ ] like UFC and I didn't I love it I love it man let's go [ __ ] watch me be my friend be my buddy that [ __ ] weak-ass [ __ ] I found out through this path of life who is David Gaga's Who am I so going through all I did it alone there was no [ __ ] trophy on the [ __ ] wall on the mantel that trophy is my [ __ ] brain no one helped me get you know I pay my [ __ ] bills no one did [ __ ] for me no one ran those [ __ ] miles lost that [ __ ] weight with the hood I suffered on my own and developed this man who said Who I am a very competitive ultra competitive do that take it what you want man I call that personal sovereignty exactly who's not a lot of people that have that that's me and there's a lot of people that change who they are depending upon what people want from them and that's that's me yeah that's important man most people struggle their whole life to find out who they are struggle their whole their whole life to find out what defines them what they actually enjoy and what they don't you start putting yourself in situations that suck you'll find yourself yeah you'll find it real quick that is the thing right and that's one of the things that have gotten from paying attention to you is that you what you're preaching what you're talking about is finding yourself through struggle it's it it's only way to find yourself you don't find yourself if you like best present and you [ __ ] press all the [ __ ] time what are you finding out if you like to swim that's all you want to do is swim what are you finding out put that in people always I people talk about triple down on your [ __ ] strengths right that's the [ __ ] weakest [ __ ] in the world no triple down on your [ __ ] weaknesses yeah find out something about yourself you right know that you're good [ __ ] you know the happy [ __ ] right that's why I'm on my Facebook page because why don't you talk about good times you know how to get you that [ __ ] [ __ ] you don't need a [ __ ] you don't need to I tell you how to get to its happy right that's easy [ __ ] right I want to tell you how you can help yourself get through the times that suck real life this is real life 90% of your life will suck 10% will be [ __ ] happy you may be lucky God have a lot of [ __ ] money have a great ass woman all this [ __ ] trust me one on one with that [ __ ] guy he's missing something his life still sucks that he hasn't faced something that bothered him his whole [ __ ] life something is still eating that [ __ ] up almost everybody everybody eating you the [ __ ] up but maybe you found a good way how I did growing up on how to ignore that voice that's saying you ain't facing some [ __ ] period man I'm not special I just stopped listening I I listen to that voice it was why I talk so [ __ ] aggressive people said man do you believe in God you cuss so much when I say [ __ ] it's a is letting you know what I'm thinking if I try to make it all pretty and [ __ ] that's not what my life was it was a violent violent struggle daily to get where I'm at today I'm not gonna water it down like a watered down [ __ ] wasn't fun ain't fun today I'm happy don't you think that your happiness is probably elevated by the amount of pain that you've gone through a hundred percent so the amount of suffering that you understand the amount of pain that you've gone through makes you appreciate the happiness and the beautiful moments with much more intensity that's what weak people miss about my story weak people hear this soft kid I'm a guy he must be miserable oh my god what the hell is wrong with them you're missing the [ __ ] story you're not listening to the story man look what I overcame if that doesn't put some badge of honor tattooed in your [ __ ] brain for the rest of your life you can die today talking to Joe Rogan you're missing the story man am I happy what the [ __ ] do you think don't miss it don't misunderstand the past and wish I speak for not being intensely happy happiest person in the world but I'm not done so not gonna speak to you like oh man everything is great no I have a lot more [ __ ] to do a lot more [ __ ] to do well this is in the same use of the word that you used the Warriors mentality the Warriors life right this is this is the way that you can keep balanced and sane right and and keep a good grip on who you are period and like there's a quote that was said I don't know who said it but was a great quote this guy said going into combat going into war out of the hundred men that going to war tension you [ __ ] be there eighty of them are this target's ten do most of or nine do most of fighting one is a warrior and it's a true quote to life I saw it going through train I saw it everywhere I went there's so many people who just show up to life that shouldn't even [ __ ] be around and there's a few people who do all the work I wanted to be part of that nine and I'm working towards being that one and that's how I live my life now what are you doing with your life these days right now I keep the same I'm very routine I get every morning I run I go to the gym and then at nighttime I stretch out I am a mom just trying to develop a business costing me a lot of money trying to do that I'm just getting out I'm an introvert so I never want to get on social media I'm not big on that I'm big on being with yourself I believe all these [ __ ] cameras and phones and [ __ ] it takes you away from the most powerful thing in the world which is your [ __ ] mind so I try hard to continue to grow that I'm trying to break a record again I'm trying to cross Death Valley as fast as possible top of Mount Whitney and I'm constantly trying to put goals and for me but the biggest thing is I'm trying to find more of myself and the only way I can find more is to silence the world out as much as I can because it's getting busier every day it's getting faster and the faster it gets the more you are missing who the [ __ ] you are so I trapped my own mind a lot and said look man I put my phone away I'll put [ __ ] away and I go dark I go dark a lot and it's because I have to find out I'm on a journey of life and we all have a different journey and I want to be in my [ __ ] pine box and I believe your spirit lives forever has too it's too [ __ ] powerful no way in hell that thing that's dies when you die I want to be able to look back on my life and I'm all dead and be so [ __ ] proud of myself forever this is all temporary [ __ ] to me I want to be forever proud of who I was as a man and change who I used to be the liar the insecure guy the guy who can whatever I want to be proud but if I died now if I die at 84 diet 9800 I want to look at myself as a proud of myself don't you think that also like we were saying that because you've gone through so much struggle you appreciate happiness true happiness do you think that you appreciate discipline because you weren't discipline do you think you appreciate the hard work you put in because you used to be weak yes I appreciate self-discipline yes I never had a crazy thing about what you know you say that I have a [ __ ] can wake me up at 3 o'clock in the [ __ ] morning and say hey you gotta get your [ __ ] in I had no trainer I have a nutritionist it was the self-discipline that I had to survive not survive I was weak to thrive no one say man you're 297 pounds man I wanna help you out I mean you're [ __ ] you're not smart I'm gonna help you out I had to work at all this [ __ ] I had to overcome and and it self discipline is everything if you don't have it I don't look at you right now I know you're capable of more it's not discipline so much for me it's all on you it's all on you the self part it was big we need someone to hold people accountable [ __ ] that [ __ ] man [ __ ] that [ __ ] we we count on people too much to get us through [ __ ] and we look to our right we look to our left we're looking for help and if you can build that self you can build that total accountability in oneself and it's not about being selfish I'm trying to create a better me so hopefully people who are hearing this are taking it the right way can say I can run a mile anybody run a 205 [ __ ] mile doing for Venis it ain't bout all that [ __ ] she doesn't matter I want you to see how [ __ ] far you can go and that's all it's about yourself and that's where it all comes from Willis and I guarantee you've already done that what you experienced from watching that television show and with what got you out the door what got you to sort of take the first steps to change your life will you experience by watching rocky what you experience of inspiration those are critical for people they need to know that someone's done something that someone's done something that's greater than they what they could imagine themselves doing and they want to take a step towards trying to be better that inspiration is gigantic and sometimes it comes across as corny you know people read it too much of it online it becomes it drowns out you lose that the meaning gets lost I mean there's and there's a lot of posers because a lot of people are out there that are there pretending that they're trying to offer up inspiration or a true honest account of their experiences but really what they're trying to do is say something that's gonna get likes right you know they're trying to say things that they think people are gonna go yeah double high five right you know there's a thing that people are doing when they're just trying to just get social cred I said yes social media is man I'm gonna paint you the picture of my fake life right right right I paint you a picture of my [ __ ] real life yeah period like it or not man but that brought that real life is fuel for people right it's fuel for me I mean I died I love that [ __ ] I live off of it there's a lot of people that I follow online and you're one of them that I can get something out of that I could watch a short clip of you talking I'm sure clips of this podcast people gonna play these clips and go for [ __ ] crazy runs afterwards right well hope so [ __ ] yeah uh-huh you don't even have to hope it's gonna happen that's good that's good what is this business you're doing well it's my own Goggins LLC basically I I'm investing in myself I'm invested in myself and I hope that this story is can can change somebody's life not to be me cuz they ain't bout me and I and I I try to be as real as I can because we're all [ __ ] for in this world we're all hurting and I try to take away all titles you want to give me that you know that I did not come from that [ __ ] that's right to be so authentic and so real about my own insecurities my own faults my this being a [ __ ] up person I'm not the best at anything I'm not I'm not gifted I'm just driven and it's all about trying to share that message with people this is all about you know I speak to a lot of people and that's what that's what I do now and how are you doing it as a business I do something more of a tional speaking but you know right now I'm not really try making a lot of [ __ ] money I'm just trying to build the brand I was authentic as possible because I don't want to build it too fast because my biggest fear in life is people can rewrite through a [ __ ] that's not real I do it all the time like a lot of people have these great quotes and they and they mass produce I can't mass-produce something man Brian and they and they had these great quotes and [ __ ] but are you living that [ __ ] which you dis quoted in how powerful it may sound are you getting up every [ __ ] morning and I'm not working out whatever are you really getting the [ __ ] after are you just talking to motivate people right and I don't want to be that guy who are you talking to pretend that you're exactly after and I people make this big money over here the side which Robin made a lot and they they talk this [ __ ] and they're off this until it's gone right and all Finnick a tall man you know it's all this [ __ ] right and I read it on my mask and [ __ ] right [ __ ] man [ __ ] wake up get after it live what you're saying and then it comes people can see when I talk the reason I talk so [ __ ] just passionate cuz I'm reliving my [ __ ] life I'm reliving this morning when I got up I want to do that [ __ ] I'm reliving everything I did it and I can't speak to you like all calm and [ __ ] [ __ ] sucks it sucks man so whenever I start talking about like after this podcast you'll see man god you're so calm right now what the [ __ ] is wrong with you I'm not going back through that [ __ ] man I'm not I'm not going back through the the suffering and [ __ ] that it took to become Who I am today some story so I built this brand to the point where I can slowly hopefully make people from motivated to driven because motivation is crap [ __ ] people right now maybe listen to this [ __ ] they'll be motivated to go run if it's closed somewhere where they're at a lot of my first we'll shut that door go back inside that's motivation it comes and go as how you feel if you and your wife are good if you and your kids are good if you're good at work you're motivated I like the [ __ ] whose life is imploded ain't got [ __ ] in life and says I still got [ __ ] good after today man it's what it's about so that's when you move from motivation to driven to obsessed and I want people to realize once you get to this portion of over here the driven obsessed part your stoppable this commitment that you have to authenticity is one of the reasons why people are connected to what you've met your messages that's one of the reasons why what you're saying you don't want to grow it too fast you don't want it to be [ __ ] you're terrified of that thing just like we were talking about with weak people you terrified a scene that weakness in yourself right you know we all see that we've all seen motivational things that are [ __ ] we've all talked to people that are talking and you realize there's nothing really that they're connected to they're not really connected to their words their words just a bunch of words they've pieced together because they sound like something that someone who's you know enlightened on the subject would say right yeah it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't connect at all so your struggle now is to try to figure out how to stay you and get the message out but still be fully connected to that message right that's you know it's not so much a struggle because I'm not really about I'm not driven by the business I'm not I'm not doing by trying to be I I make a very small salary from being retired from the military that's all I need so I'm not fast - I'm a minimalist [ __ ] give me a backpack of [ __ ] ground and sleep on and a pull-up bar and a [ __ ] some running shoes and a Subway sandwich with some [ __ ] and I'm [ __ ] straight so it's um I believe in patience I'm a patient dude I can watch the piece of grass grow for 20 years because I know that this is how you get somewhere in life by being that monk-like mentality and being able to watch something grow very calmly patiently and that's all I'm doing right now about monies and about people knowing me I'll keep you like me whoever wants to hear this is out there so so your your goal is to grow this right slowly very slowly and your goal is to grow this in order to impact people period that's it it's not about me what do you get out of impacting people it's a good question I don't I don't get anything out of it I'm a tool but you must get something there must be personal satisfaction must be a connection to those people there must be it must be enriching to you it's hard to connect with people because there's quite a few now that are coming in right it's my duty it's my duty to share my it's kind like it's somebody who discovered a new earth you know and discover the people on it that in the water source and the food source I discovered a whole nother part of your [ __ ] brain that a lot of people don't even know about it's my job by being the [ __ ] on this journey and being a discovery person being the person that maybe I discovered this part I discovered a very important part that I haven't met many people that have discovered this part I'm sure there's a lot out there but it's my job now take these weak people in the category that I was in and say uh-uh stop reading the [ __ ] stop listening to the [ __ ] and if my story of success can impact somebody it is my job is my duty to share this too as much as I'm not really fond of it I I'm the kind of guy that wants to sit in the [ __ ] room and just be me just be me alone by myself that's who I am I have to get uncomfortable and tell people all this [ __ ] you think it feels good tell me about it I'm a fourth grade reading level in high school I stuttered I lied to people to be their [ __ ] friends I didn't feel good it doesn't feel good at all but maybe someone's doing the same [ __ ] and maybe they can realize wow that [ __ ] was a piece of [ __ ] and he [ __ ] now is a Navy SEAL tired guy and Rosie's miles and was 297 pounds and pathetic [ __ ] and Wow if he would say why are you talking so it's the [ __ ] truth I was a [ __ ] pathetic [ __ ] man people cannot say that to themselves it's we have to choose these great [ __ ] magical words that that makes that make people feel good tell yourself the truth if something - cause you're [ __ ] fat they may be bullying you but you might be [ __ ] fat someone calls you dumb it's me but you might be [ __ ] dumb its life man take it for what it's worth and change it and that terrible feeling when someone does tell you they have fat you can use that as fuel period and that's all this is about and where it goes if it goes somewhere and whatever you know I don't give a [ __ ] well you said something that I think of when I run and it's that most people quit at 40% I said that's not 40% rule man I love that about 40% rule man and I am I really developed that through my heart surgeries and I developed that through that first hunch at my run is I thought I had given 100% the house on that chair at Mile 70 I was [ __ ] up I thought I'd given 100% and to go that last I go man there had this I wasn't even near 100% so I came up with this thing called the 40% rule it's basically where you it's like a car you put a governor on a car and they said the car can go 130 that governor stops the car at 91 and you're driving thinking man I want to [ __ ] Florida but I can't go I can't go any faster we do it to a brain we put a governor brain second we feel pain discomfort suffering all those words that we hate to say cuz we in this happy peaceful world we live in now we stop we slow down and if you can get through these different barriers and gain five percent 2% 3% that 40% becomes 60 that's 60 per kid kind of 70 and 80 and 90 and then you're hopefully one day near a hundred I don't I don't know many people who probably add a hundred I mean we think we're there but there's so much more it isn't a hundred at death's door though I love that I think it's true I think that's 100% true I think when you were laying in that tub you'd knocked on a door that is that is a hundred percent true no one has ever if that is our position I didn't give a hundred percent in that 101 mile run I did for the first time so that's the scary thing that's the scariest thing in the world I didn't die you probably gave 99.99999 man dude I don't know how to end this any better than that so let's just wrap this up if people want to find your stuff what's the best place to go and look for it I'm just at David Goggins man social media or Instagram Facebook I don't tweak that much stuff out because I'm I write these I write messages and I always link that you know on Twitter to my Facebook and Instagram but it's just at David Goggins it was an honor and privilege thanks like your lunch man I really really really appreciate it thank you Dave and Goggins ladies and gentlemen go after it you [ __ ] come on if that doesn't fire me [Applause] [Music] [Music]"

      "text": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcometo the Huberman Lab podcast where we discuss scienceand science-based tools for everyday life. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm Andrew Huberman,and I'm a professor of neurobiologyand ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. My guest today is David Goggins. David Goggins is aretired Navy SEAL who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. He's also a highly accomplishedultramarathon runner. For those of youthat don't know, ultramarathons aredistances longer than 26 miles and, inDavid's case, often longer than 200 miles. For his achievementsin athletics, he has been inducted intothe International Sports Hall of Fame. He also held a Guinness WorldRecord for the most pull-ups completed in 24 hours. I should mention that not onlywas David a decorated Navy SEAL, but he also graduatedfrom Army Ranger School. David is also a highlysuccessful writer, having authored two books, thefirst entitled \"Can't Hurt Me\" and the second entitled \"NeverFinished,\" both of which are best sellers. David's books covermany topics, including his autobiographicaldescription of what can only be described as anincredibly challenging child and young adulthood. His home was abusive. His school environmentwas abusive. He essentially had no positiveresources directed his way and. In his 20s, he found himselfto be obese, that is, more than 300pounds working a job he despised for minimal pay. And it was at that point thatDavid began an inner dialogue that forced him to explorethe demons born out of his childhood but also theposition that he found himself in as a young man andthen began the journey to navigate that dialogue andtransform himself into the Navy SEAL, the ultramarathonrunner, the bestselling author, and the extraordinarilypositive and influential man that he is today. As some of you mayknow, David has done various public lectures. He's a familiar faceonline because there are so many clips of him on YouTube. And he has done podcasts before. However, I'm certain thatyou'll find today's discussion to be very differentthan previous podcasts that David has been featured on. The reason isthat-- of course, we get into his accomplishments. We talk about themindset that allowed him to achieve those things. But, today, David reallylets us under the hood. He lets us into theform of inner dialogue that he has toembrace, indeed that he has to grapple with on a dailybasis, sometimes multiple times throughout the dayand night in order to impose the sortof self-discipline that he is so well known for. We also get into some ofthe scientific mechanisms underlying willpower. And we talk aboutDavid's current endeavors that include, for instance,his own exploration of science and medicine for which hehas become an intense scholar and practitioner. I should mention that multipletimes throughout today's discussion you willhear curse words. Now David and I bothacknowledge that cursing isn't for everybodyand that cursing itself is different thancursing at somebody. Nonetheless, we do realizethat many people, parents perhaps especially, mightnot want to hear cursing. If you don't wantto hear cursing, well, then this podcast episodeis probably not for you. However, if you arecomfortable with cursing or if you can tolerateit, I assure you today's discussionis highly worthwhile. Before we begin, I'dlike to emphasize that this podcast is separatefrom my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, partof my desire and effort to bring zero cost toconsumer information about science andscience-related tools to the general public. In keeping withthat theme, I'd like to thank the sponsorsof today's podcast. Our first sponsoris Maui Nui Venison. Maui Nui Venison is the mostnutrient dense and delicious red meat available. I've spoken beforeon this podcast and there's general consensusthat most people should strive to consume approximately1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. Now when one strivesto do that, it's important to maximize thequality of that protein intake to the calorie ratiobecause you don't want to consume anexcess of calories when trying to getthat 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. Maui Nui Venison has anextremely high quality protein to calorie ratio. So it makes getting that 1gram of protein per pound of body weight extremely easy. It's also delicious. Personally, I likethe ground venison. I also like the venison steaks. And then for conveniencewhen I'm on the road, I like the jerky. The jerky has a very highprotein to calorie ratio. So it has as much as 10 gramsof protein per jerky stick, and it has somethinglike only 55 calories, so, again, makingit very easy to get enough protein withoutconsuming excess calories. If you would like totry Maui Nui Venison, you can go tomauinuivenison.com/huberman to get 20% off your first order. Again, that'smauinuivenison.com/huberman to get 20% off. Today's episode is alsobrought to us by AeroPress. AeroPress is similar to aFrench press for making coffee, but it is, in fact, a muchbetter way to make coffee. I first learned about AeroPresswell over 10 years ago. And I've been usingone ever since. AeroPress was developedby Alan Adler, who was an engineer at Stanford. And I knew of Alanbecause he had also built the so-called AerobieFrisbee, which I believe at one time, perhapsstill now, held the Guinness Bookof World Records for furthest thrown object. And I used to see Alan,believe it or not, at parks around Palo Altotesting out different Aerobie Frisbees. So he was sort offamous in our community for developing thesedifferent feats of engineering that turned intocommercial products. Now I love coffee. I'm somebody that drinks coffeenearly every day, usually about 90 to 120minutes after I wake up in the morning,although not always. Sometimes if I'mgoing to exercise, I'll drink coffee firstthing in the morning. But I love, love, love coffee. And what I've personally foundis that by using the AeroPress, I can make the best possibletasting cup of coffee. I don't know what exactlyit is in the AeroPress that allows the samebeans to be prepared into a cup of coffee that tastesthat much better as compared to any other form ofbrewing that coffee, even the traditional French press. The AeroPress isextremely easy to use. And it's extremely compact. In fact, I take it withme whenever I travel. And I use it on the road,in hotels, even on planes. I'll just ask forsome hot water, and I'll brew my coffee ortea right there on the plane. If you'd like to tryAeroPress, you can go to aeropress.com/huberman. That's A-E-R-O-P-R-E-S-S dotcomslash Huberman to get 20% off any aeropress coffeemaker. AeroPress ships anywherein the USA, Canada, and over 60 othercountries around the world. Again, that'saeropress.com/huberman to get 20% off. Today's episode is alsobrought to us by Eight Sleep. Eight Sleep makes smart mattresscovers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity. I've spoken many timesbefore on this podcast about the fact thatsleep is the foundation of mental health, physicalhealth, and performance. Now a key component ofgetting a great night's sleep is that in order to falland stay deeply asleep, your body temperatureactually has to drop by about 1 to 3 degrees. And in order to wake up feelingrefreshed and energized, your body temperatureactually has to increase by about1 to 3 degrees. One of the best ways to makesure that those temperature changes occur at the appropriatetimes, at the beginning and throughout and at the endof your night when you wake up, is to control the temperatureof your sleeping environment. And that's what EightSleep allows you to do. It allows you to program thetemperature of your mattress and sleeping environmentsuch that you fall and stay deeply asleepeasily and wake up each morning feeling incrediblyrefreshed and energized. I've been sleeping onan Eight Sleep mattress cover for almostthree years now. And it has dramatically improvedthe quality of my sleep. If you'd like totry Eight Sleep, you can go toeightsleep.com/huberman to get $150 off their Pod3 mattress cover. Eight Sleep currentlyships in the USA, Canada, UK, select countriesin the EU, and Australia. Again, that'seightsleep.com/huberman. And now for my discussionwith David Goggins. David Goggins, welcome. DAVID GOGGINS: My man. Good to see you again, man. ANDREW HUBERMAN:Great to see you. It was late 2016,early 2017, I believe, when you were inmy lab at Stanford. DAVID GOGGINS: Yes sir. ANDREW HUBERMAN: We did alittle work later that day down in San Jose. And, gosh, see you everywhere,but it's not enough. So great to have you here. DAVID GOGGINS: Thanks forhaving me on, brother. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. You embody disciplineand doing hard things. I think we should juststart right off with-- DAVID GOGGINS: Yeah. Let's just go there. ANDREW HUBERMAN:--the bold truth. But right beforewe went hot mics, we were talking about learning. Right now, you're spending sometime learning and doing things that I think most peopleprobably don't typically associate David Goggins with. DAVID GOGGINS: Right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Why don'tyou tell us about that? DAVID GOGGINS: Well,most people just look at me as the guy thatruns and yells as he's running. While I do that tomotivate people, but people don't understandthat my day is broken up into segments. I work out. I eat. I sleep, but I spendmost of my time studying. So like I'm inthe medical world. I'm a paramedic in Canada. But I spend a lotof my time trying to nuke every single thingabout it because I'm not trying to just be aparamedic, learn about veins, and arteries, and how the heartpumps, and stuff like that. I'm trying to learnto the point where I can save someone's life. And even though paramedics aredoing that all over the world, I'm trying to be thatparamedic that can really dissect exactly what's going onand figure out what medication goes where, just trying tolearn the algorithm of what's going on, man. So I spent a lotof time with it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ilove the word algorithm because when I teachbiology or try and learn anything that's relatedto biology and especially the human body, I needto know the nouns. But it's the verbs that matter. And that's really whatyou're talking about. Just saying that sits there,that brain part there, doesn't tell you howit all works together. So what does your processfor studying look like? If we dropped acamera in the room, brought a microphone intoyour inner dialogue-- gosh, wouldn't we all love that. But if we dropped a microphoneinto your inner dialogue, are you waking up lookingat the books and going, yeah, fresh day, let's learn oris some of the same resistance that you've talked aboutcoming up around physical work, is that coming upfrom time to time? DAVID GOGGINS: You knowwhat, I was nervous at first. I'm going to keep it real. I'm going to keep it real. So I'm not a real smart guy. And what I mean by that isI was born with ADD, ADHD. Like my brain cannotretain information. I'm not some genetic freakwhen it comes to running, when it comes tolifting weights. I am absolutely thebottom of the barrel. And people willnever believe me. And they can just whatever. Believe what youwant to believe. So when you ask me this questionabout what does studying look like for me, I have to go overthe same page over, and over, and over, and over again, whileJennifer can look at that page while she's quizzing me,she'll learn it right then as she's-- she didn'tknow anything about it. She will quiz herselfor quiz me and learn it as she's quizzing me. It's the most frustratingthing in the world how my brain works. So what I do is I literallysit there with a pen and paper. And I have my books. And I go through andhave to write everything down every single day. I will study thesame page until it's photographic memory fromwriting the same thing down. And then from there, I'll goback through and relearn it again. So I'll learn the bulk of it. But then I'll go throughand learn the small things within that. So if it's a medication, I'lllearn what the medication does. First, I'll learnhow to even say the medication becausethese medications aren't like albuterol. No, it's very big words. So I'll go through, learnhow to say the name. Then I'll go throughlearn what the dose is. Then I'll go through-- andthis is like every single day. So it's not like, oh, I got it. Let's just go through--no, nothing is I got it. Every single thing--so I can't wait to get in this conversationbecause everything I do in life, it sucks. Everything I doin life, it sucks. That's why when I was 300pounds and 24 years old, it wasn't like I had somebig epiphany of let's just go be a Navy SEAL, andlet's lose some weight. No, I knew my entirelife was going to be a struggle, whichis why I just ignored it. And I said, I'm not even tryingto jump off any of this shit and learn how to read, howto write, how to memorize, how to becomesomething I am not. But through that process,something happened to me. And I realized-- this iswhy I feel sorry for no one. In this podcast, they'regoing to really not like me because peopleare going to think that I am maybe lying ormaybe fibbing or exaggerating. No, I am literally-- I was the lowest form on Earth,no talent, no ability to learn. And I literally know whatit is to be rock bottom and to build that up. So that question aboutlearning is the pain in my ass. And I don't have to do it. Just think about it. I'm 49 years old, andI'm a multi-millionaire. I don't have to do anything. So all I thought aboutwhen I was growing up is, man, I can't wait toone day get to the point where I no longerhave to do this stuff. But what happenedas I got older, it became a way of living. So how I do every dayis how I do every day. It's a discipline. It's a regimen. It was a choice I made. And the choice I made was whatare you willing to sacrifice, and what are you willing togive up to find every bit of who you are as a human being? And I was willing to giveup everything to do that. So studying is no joke. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I lovethat you're studying. I recall a few years ago, Iheard some interview or podcast with you. And you just threw out like Idon't know what I'll do next. Maybe I'll be a scientist. And I went yeah. Because I knew-- becauseI know you a bit. And I see your workout there, but we had met before,that if you decided that you were going to do it-- and learning medicine,which is what you're doing, learning human physiologyis so detailed. DAVID GOGGINS: Very. ANDREW HUBERMAN:And people out there have to understand whenyou look at a textbook and you see the veins and thecapillaries different colors, when the body is open,they're not different colors. DAVID GOGGINS:Right, right, right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: SoI mean, some things have different colorcontrasts, but it's not like it's all labeledwhen you pop it open. DAVID GOGGINS: Exactly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And so theprocess of writing things down by hand is important for you. So you go back andread those notes. Do you think aboutthat stuff on your runs too or are yousegmenting your day like when you're done studying,are you heading out for a run and thinking about other things? Or are you still rehearsingthe material in your head? DAVID GOGGINS: So when I writeit down, I write it down, and I'm able to-- I'm actually lookingdown at this table right now becauseI'm back to writing. So I'm actually there rightnow as I'm speaking to you. I write it down in a waythat I'm memorizing page 69. So I'm writing it down. So then writing it down and thatpage sync together in my brain. So I'm looking at the bookin my brain right now. That's just how it works for me. And I have to do itover and over again. So that page isstuck in my mind. So I'm literallyflipping through pages as I'm taking these tests. And I'm taking these nationaltests to become a paramedic or become an advancedEMT or whatever. I'm literally as I'm takingthat test I'm going through. And I'm like-- now I'mflipping pages in my head where that page was. And how I do that isjust from how I write it and how it's on the page. When I run, I can'trecall any of it. I cannot bring any ofthat because I'm running. How my mind is wired now is thateverything I do is what I do. Because the focus it takes forme to-- right now, I'm running. I'm not like a great runner. I'm not like injury free. So like my first 20 minutesof the run I'm limping. I'm literallylimping because I've had several knee surgeries. And my body was twisted. And so now it's untwisting. So people look at me, oh, looks,like he's limping when he runs. I am limping when I run. My body is jackedup so I'm focusing on how to get the bestout of a broken body. So everything I dois a total focus on what I'm doing atthat point in my life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So itseems like you've really trained away or somehowgotten away from the ADD that you mentionedbecause what you described is like a deep trench. It's like a V shaped trench. I'm imagining likethere's a ball bearing, and it's like, phewp, and it canonly go forward in that trench or back. And it goes forward. It's not like sliding aroundat the concave at the bottom, zip-zip-zip, like a tension. So it's like youtrained that up. Is there a similarfeeling when you're in the full focus of runningversus full focus of studying? Does it kind offeel like, oh yeah, that's the same groove butdifferent thing or is it just completely different world? DAVID GOGGINS: It's acompletely different world. Both of them forme is suffering, but it's suffering awhole different way. Like when I was going throughschool, I never forget-- I think I was in third grade. And back then, ADD, ADHD,wasn't like here's this medicine or here's this thing. They want to put youin a special school. So for me, I was sofar behind in learning that their big thingwas let's just put him in a special schoolbecause he'll never learn. And through thatprocess of like I don't want to be ina special school, I don't want to be treatedany differently, it really-- like I never took medication. I've never takenmedication for this. That's why right now you seeme looking right in your eyes. What the hell is Hubermansaying right now. And that's why I don't feelbad for people who have ADHD, who have learning disabilities. And some are impossiblebecause you just can't. But a lot of them you can. But people don't want to gothrough the process of focus, of teaching yourselfhow to truly focus. This is where mymessage gets lost. It gets lost because I maysay MF or F because that's the passion thatcomes out of me. It takes everything forme to learn a sentence. So when I speakabout David Goggins, I can't speak about DavidGoggins in a way that's just calm and cool. Because when I wakeup, I know the journey that it takes for meto find my greatness. And it's hard. Nothing is easy. Nothing just like, oh, Iwake up, and I just do this or I do that or it just--no, I watch people every day go through life,and it's so easy. For me to be where I'm attoday, it takes every bit of me. So when I speak about it,and as I get going here, you'll start seeing me--the tempo will rise. The passion will come outbecause I'm back there. I'm doing what I do everyday to become a human being. And so nothing is easy. Like running is running. It sucks. But you have a choice to make. Do you want to sit down and goback to that guy you once were? No. So this is what it takes. It takes thatmisunderstanding of people. And they'll never get it becausethey were never David Goggins. So that is what it takesfor me to do what I do. It may take yousomething differently. So for me, everythinghas to be in the study. Everything has to be into this. Everything has tobe in-- everywhere I am it has to be there,me, focused where I am. That's why you'remy second podcast I've done since Rogan,since the book came out. I don't have time for that shitbecause if I want to be great, I'm not trying to maximize moneyor maximize people knowing me. I do these things becausemaybe someone out there will understand me and get it andsay, I can grow from this guy, and others just won't. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Soundslike friction is something you're very familiar with. It's a word just I feellike is like cast above us right now in bold face,highlighted, underlined letters. DAVID GOGGINS:Friction is growth. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Friction,like you're up in the morning. And I imagine David Gogginsgoing to the coffee maker, stretching out, goodmorning, sunshine. And you're telling me fromeyelids open there's friction. DAVID GOGGINS: Yes, and thatis the thing that people don't-- they don't fucking get. The biggest misunderstandingabout David Goggins of all time-- it's like whether youbelieve in God or not-- I do-- he put this lab rat,which is me, on this planet and said let me fuckingsee what a beat up, abused kid who can barelylearn, barely learn, who has a twisted body, messedup genetics, sickle cell, this and that, let megive him everything that pretty much disqualifiesyou from the military. But back then, it wasn't as--and let's put him in this and see what comes out of it. So to do that, friction-- you don't wake upin the morning time and go to the coffee maker. Matter of fact, sometimesyou don't even sleep. What it requiresis when I'm at-- 2 o'clock-- it's 2o'clock in the morning. And my brain is thinkingabout a fucking drug. And I got to get upand look in my book to see what that drugis, how I remember it. And this is every dayof my fucking life. That's why when I train afighter or I train someone, I'm like, you have no fuckingidea how great you really are because you areusing such minimal, minimal of what you have. And if people can learn tofocus, this is what's possible. While it may notbe pretty-- like people want to do adocumentary on me. I go no. I don't want to doa documentary on me because I will have normaleveryday people picking me apart. Oh, his life is miserable. Who wants to live like that? It's crazy how he-- it'salmost like he's sick. He's psychotic. The most frustratingthing in the world for me is when normal peoplejudge a man like myself on what it really takes toextract greatness from nothing. It takes every bit of who youare if you choose that route. If you don't, Merry Christmas,do what you got to do. But, yeah, all thesethings for me-- like I told you, man, I'mgoing to keep it real. I'm not coming here to talkabout perform without purpose because I go through-- when I write thesebooks, I go through, I try to dumb downDavid Goggins. How can I give normalpeople-- and I'm normal. But I found something thatmost don't want to find. How can I speak topeople and give them something from this crazypsychotic brain that I've developed? How can I give them that? So I sit down withJennifer for years and write down performwithout purpose, callus your mind, armoryour mind, the cookie jar, the accountability mirror, shitthat people can fucking use in their lives. No, no, I'm glad it helps you. But the barbaric life that Ilive that you have to live, the almost obsession thatyou must have to be great, you can't put that shitin a fucking book, bro. You can't put in a book. You can't. You can't write about it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ithas to be experienced. DAVID GOGGINS: It hasto be experienced. And you can't even-- after you experience it,to write it in the book, it would seem like heneeds to be locked up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Too gory. DAVID GOGGINS: It's too gory. Doesn't make sense fora guy that everything, every second of theday he is trying to extract more from something. He's constantly thinking. He's constantly,constantly disciplined, never going off the path. Whatever is injured onhim, he figures away. It's a conquerors mindset. And very few people, if any, canreally understand what that is. Like I'm almost 50. And I've been this wayfor almost 30 years. Like what do you do for fun? These questions,I don't get them. I don't understand them. I don't-- so yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I getasked that sometimes, what do you do for fun. I start listing off all thisstuff like podcasting, reading, working out. So some of that resonates. But I think what's sotruly unusual about what you're describing, your processis that from go it's hard. And I have to ask was being 300pounds, having essentially-- I'm using the wordsyou've described. DAVID GOGGINS: No, do it. ANDREW HUBERMAN:You've said it before. You had a tendency at onepoint in your life early on tell lies, try andget people's approval. DAVID GOGGINS: Lied my ass off. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Crazyhaircuts, attention seeking, and yet all of thattriggered something that now is extraordinary. Do you think thosehardships were necessary to flip the switch? DAVID GOGGINS: I don't knowif they were necessary, but it was somethingthat made me feel-- I didn't feel good. It was easy. The brain that I wasgiven as a child, it was easy to gohome and think about, how do I want tobe a freak today? How do I want to show up toschool today and be a freak? It didn't require me going homeand opening a book up saying, it's going to take me all yearto learn this fucking page. So instead oflearning that page, I learned how tobecome a character. And maybe that characterthat I created, that 300 pound,insecure guy that used to fake it tillI make it type of guy, let me become yourfriend, let me lie to you until you like me type of guy-- when you have any manhood,womanhood, a human being, a soul, a spirit, any-- I must have just this muchpride because that's exactly what opened the door for me. Because every day,you were a character. Every day, you were a clown. Every day, you opened thatSpanish book or that science book or English book,and you looked at it. It looked like aforeign language. And you're saying,where do I start? Where do I start? And, obviously,it was necessary. The more I talk about it, itwas necessary because what happened is I becamehaunted by the mere fact that this is my existence. And you got to live with that. And I lived with itfor a lot of years. And so I sat back andsaid, OK, all right, I know what this takes. And when you sit back,as fucked up as I was-- and I had a laundrylist, a table like this of what Ihave to do to become just a human being thatcan make ends meet, that can make $1,000 a month. Just to get there was like,oh my god, dude, like how-- I'm 16, 17, I can't read. I can't write. Oh my god, I'm sobehind the power curve. And my brain is aboutbeing depressed. And my dad beat--my mom's not home. And kids are callingme nigger at school. And I'm like, oh my god,man, what the fuck do I do? And it wasn't like someonecame around and said, hey, man, you can do this. This is all me. Some people want to know wheredoes this cold man come from. I'm not trying to be cold. It's the reality of my life. It's the reality of alot of people's lives. And so, yeah, that had tohappen for me to be haunted, to be haunted, topull out, to extract the guy that I am today. That haunting is somethingthat's still there today because no matterhow much you improve, no matter how much youchange who you are, it's not permanent. You don't just wake upand say, oh my god, man, you're David Goggins. You break records. You do this. You do that. People want to know, how areyou able to just be so hard? Because I never turnthe fucking thing off. Because once it turnsoff, I go right back to the David Goggins that is. And that's the guy that I'mconstantly fighting every day. And it's a choice. And that choice makesyou misunderstood. It makes you crazy. That's why I hatefucking social media. In 2013, people wantedme to write my book. I did it in 2018. Took five years. And the reason whyI didn't do it-- I sat at the table,and Jennifer was there. This was before shestarted working for me, I started datingher or whatever. And all these people were there. And they're like, man, yougot to go on social media. And I was like, fuck you, man. It's poison. It's poison because I knewwhat I did to get where I am. And I'm going tohave these people, these normal, everydaypeople, fat, lazy, exactly who I was judging me. Because I know itbecause I was once them. All my hard work,all my dedication, I'm going to havesome normal dude get his little brownie, his littleDing Dong, Ho Ho, Twinkie, sit there with hiscoffee picking me apart. Oh, he must be unhappy. Do you know how hard itis to put these shoes on every damn morning? And I'm gonna haveyou pick me apart? So, yeah, there's somuch that goes into this that I was like fuck this. I never wantedanything to do with it. So anyway. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'mnot a psychologist. But knowing your storyfrom what you've written, what you've saidon social media, and elsewhere, podcasts andhere now especially, it's amazing to me, and,frankly, it pulls at my heartstringsa little bit I realize that's not whatyou're trying to do but that in the course of yourchildhood and in your young adulthood that no one evergot between you and the world. I forget where I heard itthat if a kid has just one person that believes in them-- and I had my trialsand tribulations. But I had greatcoaches, great mentors. I attached to them. I found them if theydidn't necessarily find me. But I'm realizing that yoursituation was no one's ever said, hey, I'm going tostand here next to you or get in front ofyou, put a shield up. And so it's almost likeyou've got these different-- it's all you, but there'sversions of yourself-- that like you knew socialmedia-- like I don't know that I have the wherewithalin 2013 '14, '15, '16, '17 to get in frontof myself while doing all this because I've alreadygot so much going on in here. Is that about right? DAVID GOGGINS: That is right. But I had developeda lot of anger. And I still have it. And it will never go awayfor the normal human beings of this world because whenyou put yourself in the sewer like I was in-- and please,if someone saved me, come out and announceit to the world. There was no one. There's no one. So when you know that-- and then I'msitting at the table with all these smartpeople who are telling me what to do and shit andguiding me through my life now when I'm 40fucking years old. It's 2000-- I don't know40-something years old. Now I'm 49. And I'm looking at them all. And they're nowtrying to guide me on what's right on this poison. And so, yeah, whatyou say is right. But for me, it wasmore of I know now. I don't need youto guide my future. I know what's good forme and what's bad for me. And for me, it took everybit of focus I could. And I know social media-- that's why people love to go onthere because they want to show you the good side of life. I'm not teachinggood side of life. So I had to figureout a way when I came on 2016 of teachingyou what life really is for the majority of us is hell. And so while people love to showyou the cars, and the house, and the vacations andshit, all that's good. All that's happy. I'm going to show you theside that I know most of you are going through. And people hide very well. I don't want to hide anymore. I hid it for 24 fucking years. So that's why nowwhen I told you we can talk aboutwhatever you want because as human beings, thefirst thing we have to learn-- I also stutteredreal bad growing up. So if you hear me stutterevery now and then, it's because that waspart of my life also. So it's funny. Human beings want toshow you the best side. And they want tohide the worst side. For me, I'm goingto teach you how to be vulnerable because that'sthe only way you fix yourself. You don't fix yourselfby coming out here and me selling yousome fucking books. That's why I don't have them. I forgot them. I'm glad people gotsomething from the book. I want you to learn thatthe only way you grow is how to look atyourself and say, OK, like I did, table longer thanthis, what the fuck I have to do to get somewhere? There was nothing goodon there, nothing. Yeah, I lovedplaying basketball. I left that out. That's something I love to do. I don't care about that. That didn't makethe fucking list because the listthat I had to live by was the very list that wasgoing to get me at this table with you to talk to you tothe normal human beings, which I once was, about how you canget somewhere and how it looks. It looks very ugly. There's no fucking passion. There's no fucking motivation. There's no, oh mygod, man, I fucking-- no, it's every day ofyour life just doing, no passion, no discipline, nomotivation, all these words. I hate that so many peoplefucking use these words now because it's watered. Someone sitting inthe room by themselves and they figure themselvesout and say, god, this is going to fucking suck. Where's passion whenyou're 300 pounds? Where's the motivation whenyou can't read and write? Where is it? So how did this happen? I just fucking did. I just did. I said maybe at theend of this journey, there will besomething there for me. If not, I can read. If not, I'm 185 fucking pounds. There was no magic potion. There was no, oh, let me wakeup and look at some shit. No. All those words are overused. They're bullshit. It's all bullshit. Just do. You're living. How do you want to live? How do you want to die? How do you want tofucking be remembered? That's it. That's it. Period. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Asmany of you know, I've been taking AG1daily since 2012. So I'm delighted that they'responsoring the podcast. AG1 is a vitaminmineral probiotic drink that's designed to meet allof your foundational nutrition needs. Now, of course, I try to getenough servings of vitamins and minerals through whole foodssources that include vegetables and fruits every day. But, oftentimes, I simplycan't get enough servings. But with AG1, I'm sure to getenough vitamins, and minerals, and the probiotics that I need. And it also contains adaptogensto help buffer stress. Simply put, I always feelbetter when I take AG1. I have more focus andenergy, and I sleep better. And it also happensto taste great. For all thesereasons, whenever I'm asked if you could take justone supplement what would it be, I answer AG1. If you'd like to try AG1, go todrinkag1.com/huberman to claim a special offer. They'll give youfive free travel packs plus a year'ssupply of vitamin D3, K2. Again, that'sdrinkag1.com/huberman. The word haunted isringing in my head. DAVID GOGGINS: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I thinkit's such a powerful word. DAVID GOGGINS: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN:Because I was about to m it seems like a huge partof your process, maybe the entire process, isit's all stick no carrot, you talk about the carrot,the positive thing. And then there's the stick, thething you're trying to avoid. I feel like it's-- the wayit's landing for me is it's all stick and gas pedal. DAVID GOGGINS: That's it. ANDREW HUBERMAN:There's no carrot. You're not imagining, oh,when I'm a paramedic, when the book is published. And, obviously, youset those goals, and you make those targets. But it's all stick. DAVID GOGGINS: All stick. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No carrot. DAVID GOGGINS: Think about that. I'm waking upright now studying. Like I have a test tomorrow. I already passedthe fucking test. Think about that. Every day in my life,that's what I must do just to retain what I learned. Four hours plus a day, Igo through and do that. There's no stick. Or there's only a stick. There's never beena carrot, which is why when I speak topeople, I have to figure out a way to resonate with them. Because all I wantto say to them is let me teach you thereal life, how it really is. The reason why you're a loserand the reason why you're not fucking making it andthe reason why you're trying to go to all these-- I go to all thesefucking conventions, speak all the fucking time. I look in the fucking audience. And these peoplesign up, sign up, sign up fucking everyyear go to a convention, thinking they're going to learnsomething fucking different. No, you're lazy. You know exactly what todo, exactly what to do. Because even me in my stateof I can't read and write, I knew exactly what to do. It just sucks doing it. It sucks to do it. It sucks to wake up everymorning of your life and say, god, man,I'm not smart. So guess what I got to do. I got to study the same shitthat I got one of the highest scores in the nation on anddo it again, and do it again, and do it again. It's not just there. It's not just therepermanently for me. So, yeah, it's all stick. It's all stick. The only carrot you haveis like maybe, maybe. Because whenever I take thesetests that are real hard, the back of my brainis like a good chance you're not going tomake it, Goggins. This ain't you, bro. This ain't you. You weren't born like this. This ain't you. The real you, bro-- study all you want to. But the second thatfucking computer comes on with 150 questions,this ain't you, man. And somehow, comes back. I passed. I passed again, passed again. But that real me backhere every fucking time is saying that ain't you, bro. That ain't you. And I have tooutwork that voice. When I'm takingthat test and I get to a question I don'tfucking know the answer, I'm like fuck, man. And then say, seeI told you, man. That ain't you. You're 300 pounds, man. You sit at home. You figure out howto do your hair. That's what you do,how to come to school with the reversebaldness when you're 16. That's you. So there is no getout of jail free card. This is why I say stay hard. Because when youweren't given the gifts, the only thing you cando in life is stay hard. And I know peoplecannot stand me. They can't stand this talk. This is all you can do. There's no magic pillor a magic potion. All you can do isoutwork the man that God createdor woman in you. And what that lookslike is unfun. That's why I said, do notdo a documentary on me because people willnot see the truth. They will see whatthey want to see is I don't want to live like that. Good, good. And you will liveexactly the way you live now,questioning who you are, wondering what ispossible, wondering what you are capable of doing. That's how that looks or youcan be me, which am I happy? I don't know. Never really thought about it. Don't really care aboutit because all I really cared about was when I lookedin that fucking mirror, I saw a piece of shit. Happiness wasn't on the mirrorat 16 or when I was 300 pounds. It wasn't like, I'mlooking for happiness. No, I'm looking at myself inthe mirror and say, all right, motherfucker, youdid it again today. You're a bad boybecause that shit sucks. I have about a couple of minutesof that that I got the carrot. The second I lay down andgo to bed, the carrots gone because I'm waking up allthrough the night to check the work I did that day. Did I get this drug right? Did I get this right? Did I get that right? What did I do? Oh my god, fuck, I'malready losing it. Stick. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Thatstick's haunting you. DAVID GOGGINS: Haunting me. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It'sfollowing you around. So no picture ofJordan on the wall. You're not listening toYouTube inspiration video. DAVID GOGGINS: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Those wouldbe all your voice anyway. [LAUGHTER] You're not listening toyour top 10 favorite songs just to get rolling and thenlace the shoes, hit the books. It's all in here. DAVID GOGGINS: All in there. I used to do thatwhen I was fat. Rocky, I mean,that was my thing. Round 14 was my thing. And as I got older and older andolder, that started to go away. And I started to create-- I had all these peoplethat I used to watch. Rocky was one, Barnes,Elias from \"Platoon,\" Jack from \"A Few Good Men\" whenhe's on the stand going crazy. I saw a lot of thesecharacters that I looked at and I was like, man, Iain't got none of that. But they were characters. After a while, I liveda life so disciplined that every bodythat I once looked to, these fake characters,I built that as a man. And when I was younger, Ihad this image in my mind of what does a manlook like to me? And I got all these peoplewho are badasses, characters. And in my mind, I became that. And that's what keptme going a lot was I had this pipe dream ofbecoming a little bit of this and a little bit ofthat because when you have no parentsraising you and you have no role models growingup, it's not daydreaming. You start to create a realitylike, mm, maybe I can be that. And after becomingthis guy, that is the biggest thing Ican ever do in my life is I became that guy. That I once looked atall these, guys and now I look at myself like, god,who the fuck can do that? I can. But what it takesis a discipline that no one can ever even-- they don't understand it. They don't understand it. But everybody hasthe ability to do it, but they just don't want to. They want to keepasking questions and keep going to seminars. And the greatnessis right in you. And that's why once again-- I say this a million times here,I do not feel sorry for you. I will not sugarcoatwhat I'm going to say to you becauseall of you know what I'm saying is the truth. Everybody knows it's the truth. This is what it looks like. And you know it too. You know it too. If you ain't got nothing, I hateto tell you what it looks like. It's ugly. It's not a documentary. It's not an HBO special. You ain't going towatch me like, hey, man, you guys gotta watch this. No, it's like, oh, god, thislooks like a train wreck. It's like a nightmare. This looks like this guy's got--no, that's what it looks like. Hard work looks horrible. It's not motivating. It's not motivating at all. It ain't like Rocky round 14where he gets knocked down and goes like thisto Apollo Creed. Looks like a man beingstuck in a fucking dungeon. And there's no fucking way out. But you have the fucking key. But you refuse to use it. And that's nothingmotivating about that. So, yes, no documentaryon David Goggins. ANDREW HUBERMAN: The real life-- DAVID GOGGINS: The real life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --DavidGoggins is the documentary. It's already being written. You're it. DAVID GOGGINS: Right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I'm goingto share a little neuroscience tidbit. DAVID GOGGINS: Love it. ANDREW HUBERMAN:But I think it's one that you'll appreciate. Most people don'tknow this, but there's a brain structure called theanterior mid-cingulate cortex. As we pointed outbefore, that's a noun. It's a name. It doesn't mean anything. We could call itthe Cookie Monster. But what's interestingabout this brain area is there arenow a lot of data in humans, not some mouse study,showing that when people do something they don'twant to do like add three hours of exerciseper day or per week or when people who are tryingto diet and lose weight resist eating something,when people do anything that they, and thisis the important part, that they don't want to do,it's not about adding more work. It's about adding more workthat you don't want to do. This brain area gets bigger. Now here's what's especiallyinteresting about this brain area to me. And by the way, I'monly learning this recently because it's new data. But there's a lot of it. The anteriormid-cingulate cortex is smaller in obese people. It gets bigger when they diet. It's larger in athletes. It's especiallylarge or grows larger in people that seethemselves as challenged and overcome some challenge. And in people thatlive a very long time, this area keeps its size. In many ways,scientists are starting to think of the anteriormid-cingulate cortex not just as one of the seats ofwillpower but perhaps actually the seat of the will to live. DAVID GOGGINS: See,now we're talking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:And when I learned about the anteriormid-cingulate cortex, I was like almostout of my seat. And I've been in theneuroscience game since I was 20. DAVID GOGGINS:Now we're talking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:We're the same age. And I was so pumped because I'veheard of the amygdala, fear, prefrontal cortex. It's planning an action. I could tell you everybrain area and every-- I teach neuroanatomyto medical students. But when I startedseeing the data on the anterior mid-cingulatecortex, I was like, whoa, this is interesting. And all the datapoint to the fact that we can build this area up. But that as quicklyas we build it up, if we don't continue to investin things that are hard for us, that we don't want todo-- that's the part that feels so Goggin-esque to me,that we don't want to do. Like if you love the ice bath--yeah, I love the ice bath-- and you go from 1minute to 10 minutes, guess what, your anteriormid-cingulate cortex did not grow. DAVID GOGGINS: None. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But ifyou hate the cold water, if you're afraid of drowningand you get into water and put your headunder and survive, then the anterior mid-cingulatecortex gets bigger. But if you don't do it the nextday or if you do it the next day and you enjoy it because,hey, hey, I did it yesterday, woo-hoo, happy me, MerryChristmas as you would say-- DAVID GOGGINS: Right. Merry Christmas. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --guesswhat, the anterior mid-cingulate cortexshrinks again. To me, this is one of themost important discoveries that neuroscience hasever made because it's that I don't want to dosomething but do it anyway that grows this area. And it's almost like-- I have a friend. He's been sober 30years from alcohol. And he always says, theamazing thing about addiction is there's a cure. The problem is it onlyworks one day at a time. And so you have torenew it every day. DAVID GOGGINS: That's right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So the anteriormid-cingulate cortex to me-- when I learned about it, twothings went off in my head. Whoa, this is super interesting. And, two, I got to tellDavid Goggins about this. And I waited until now-- DAVID GOGGINS: I'm glad. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --to tellyou because I felt like, well, for obvious reasonsI wanted to tell you and I wanted to tell you here. DAVID GOGGINS: Well, Ilove that because that's how I've lived my entire life. I don't knowanything about that. But people go, man, youhave such a strong will. It's something that you build. Like I never forget I wason a podcast one time. And this dude goes you wereblessed with a strong mind. Like the hell areyou talking about I was blessed with a strong mind? That's something thatyou have to develop. You develop that overyears, decades of suffering and going back into the suffer. That's why a lot of people whograduate Navy SEAL training, they want to know-- I talk about it veryopenly all the time. A lot of guys don't wantto go back into that water, don't want to go backinto the hard stuff. And maybe not-- anythinghard, anything hard in life, once you get throughit, it's like you become a POW. Like how many POWs you knowwant to go back to POW camp? None. When something sucksso bad in life-- this is on this thatwe're talking about now-- very few people want to go back. They're happy they graduated. I realized I'm the same way. I don't want to go back. I have to go back. I must go back because that isexactly where all the knowledge of my life exists was backthere in what you're exactly what you're talking about. Well, I didn't knowanything about this. But how I grew a will wasconstantly doing these things to now it's just life. I wake up. While it still sucks,it's just life. You don't sit backand like, oh my god. Like I have days Idon't want to do. But I know I'm going to do it. I know from yearsof just doing it. So that's beautiful. And this is why I cameon here with you today. And I'm glad that you're talkingabout this because human beings need to hear this. They need to stop hearingthese hacks on this and that. There's no fucking hack, bro. There's no fucking hack. Yeah, you may this and thatand saunas and all this shit that they-- yeah, it's great. There is no fucking life hack. To grow that thing--how do you grow it? Do it, and do it,and do it, and do it. That's the hack. The hack is goingto fucking suck. And that's what I realized. That's what I realized. That's why I wantedto come on here today. I didn't want tocome on here and talk about no fuckingpassion and purpose and how to get thefuck out of bed and how to hit afucking alarm clock, all this catchphrase bullshitbecause that wasn't how I lived, wasn't how I lived. I lived, I woke up likeevery human being does and goes fuck, man. I'm a fucking pieceof shit today. How the hell is thisgoing to work out for me? And you fight that. And you fight that. You don't override it. There's no override button. It's the conversationin your head. So how do you do that? We don't have enoughof these conversations about the real conversation thatevery human being is having. And they have no ideahow to get out of it. But they do is thatshit right there, man. You got to build your will. How you build your will? Exactly what you said, man. Exactly what you said. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,I feel like knowing the name of something,anterior mid-cingulate cortex, doesn't fundamentally change us. But one thing Ilike about biology is that willpower, if somebodyfeels they don't have it, feels like this thingthat other people have. But everybody, unlessthey're brain-damaged, like a hole through theirhead, has two anterior mid-cingulate cortex, oneon each side of their brain. Everyone has one. They have two. So I feel like it's just aquestion of opening the portal. And the portal-- again,I'm going to say 10 times, and forgive me--is I think people go, oh, I do hard things. I do sets to failure. And then I do forced reps. I love training with weights. I love doing sets to failure. I even like forced reps. But guess what? I like forced reps. So I'll tell you,they don't build my anterior mid-cingulatecortex because I like to do it. Anything you liketo do is not going to enhance thisaspect of willpower. And it seems so obviousonce you hear it. You kind of go, ohyeah, of course. But I think you reallyclose that loop for people when you share whatyou're sharing today and what you've sharedelsewhere before as well. When you're trying toexplain the friction is the critical ingredient. And I think people think,oh, if it's effort, well, then I'm getting better. That's part of it, necessary,but not sufficient, as we say in science. But the suck part, the haunt,being haunted, the stick, they're really unpleasant terms. These are probably the mostunpleasant terms we've ever used on this podcast. Those are the--those are the levers. Those are the gears. And without those, this thingthat you're talking about, David Goggins, as a verb-- I sometimes make thejoke, but it's not a joke. Goggins is a name,and it's a verb. People go, I'm onto Goggins that. But that's, I think-- again, I'm not a psychologist. But I think that's whatyou're talking about, the stick, thefriction, being haunted. It's the suck part that growsthis anterior mid-cingulate cortex. DAVID GOGGINS: Sonow you know why there's so many peoplethat fail in this world to figure out their purpose,their purpose in life. Where do I go? Because to grow that, now,you may not look like me, how my daily life looks. It don't look fun. Don't look fun. So it's a choice thatpeople have to make in life. But what's so funny about itis even the richest of rich, who have everything, theyalways ask me this question. I feel like I'mmissing something. I don't feel likeI'm missing shit. I don't have what you all have. But you will never inmy life hear me tell you I'm missing something. And everybody is. They're missing this feeling. I found it a long time ago. And I found it right therein that willpower thing. When you're nothing,nothing, and change yourself into something, like me, youcall it happiness, peace, whatever the fuckyou want to call it, people are missing exactly whatwent on with David Goggins. Why don't you smile? I do. I do. But I figured something out. That's why I am never-- you never hear me say,I'm missing something. I found it years ago. You find it in the suck. You find it in the suck. And you find it repeatedlyin the suck to the point where you knowexactly who you are. Most people aremissing something because they don'tknow who they are. They never examined themselves. They've never done thisexperiment on themselves. The lab rat. We're all lab rats. But you're also the scientist. You create your own self. Most people aremissing something because there's somuch trapped in there. I don't even wantto say potential. I think that's a word--it's used out too much too. There's so much in you thatGod or whoever the hell you believe in or ifyou're an atheist in you that you have not unlocked,that you walk around with this gorgeous wife or greathusband and all this money. You're like, god, I feellike I'm missing something. Yeah, because it'sabout 75% of you is still fucking in there, stillchained up because you just didn't want to findyour willpower, didn't want to find yoursoul, your will, your heart, your determination,your guts, your courage. And what that lookslike, it looks scary, like you're littlescary lab that went in. Scary to wake up everyday and say, I'm stupid, but I'm going tofigure out a way to be smarter versus saying,man, I just can't do that. So you limit this box. So your box becomes sosmall of things you can do. My box wasn't even a box. It was a fucking little pinhole. And then throughexamining myself, getting some willpower,some courage, it became biggerthan this table. But that's what we all do. That's why I wanted tocome here today and talk to you about real shit,not no fucking hacks. There's no hacks, bro. It's you against you. You against you. And if youmisunderstand that, you have a real problem,real problem. I can understandyou misunderstand me, running down the street,shirt off, fuck this, no. Yeah. I can get it. I get it. If you misunderstand whatI'm saying right now today, the problem is you. And you don't want to fix it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, thechildren of wealthy people are a case study in hownot having enough friction can destroy a life. DAVID GOGGINS: True statement. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Imean, I could list off prominent names in the press. But those are actuallythe least interesting. What's probably moreinteresting, as an example, is all the ones we don'thear about because we never hear about them. They just dwindle and wither. Or I think there's thisbig category of people, I'm realizing, as we have thisconversation today that they're not super successful. They're not struggling. They're successful enoughthat they never have to-- you can get to thepoint where you don't have to impose friction. You even said it. Your bank account is in aplace where you don't really need to do allthe things you do, probably not even asmall fraction of them. DAVID GOGGINS: Do nothing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. But you realize thestick and being haunted is the fuel and the engine. And you'd be a-- you'd betruly crazy to give that up because you'veinternalized all that. But most people, they'regood enough for them. And so they don't actuallywant to be better badly enough in order to startgoing rung after rung. DAVID GOGGINS: Well, thinkabout when you build willpower. And think about howmuch I've built. Now that you know about this-- I didn't know about this. But think about howmuch I've built. Everything I've ever done inmy life, I didn't want to do. Everything every day. I'm a lazy piece of shit. And I'm one of the hardestworking people to ever step foot on this planet Earth. And I'm saying that very proudlybecause I know what I do. It's not cocky. I'll tell you I'm stupid. And I'll also tell you the exactopposite of what I've done. It's the truth. It is the truth. So imagine how much I'vedeveloped in that time frame. But this is the scary thing. Why most people don't want todo that and build that willpower is because it is scary. It unlocks a whole bunchof things about who you are and who you're not. And a lot of people don'twant to go down that journey to discover who theyare and who they're not because it's nota pretty journey. I mean, I've gone down it. It's not like Iwent down it once. I go down it all the time. And when you unlock that-- andyou can't just turn it off. Like, people say, hey, howcome you haven't retired yet? I built all this willpower. Do you think it'sgoing to let me just retire because my knees hurt? It is telling me every morning-- I wake up, and I'm like,man, my knees hurt. My legs hurt. My body hurts. But you can still run. So why aren't you running? If you can still run-- there will be a time when youcan't lace them up anymore. But you can still run. So I still run. When the time comes I can'trun, the body will say, you just can't run. But if I can stilldo something, that willpower that Ihave created, it makes me do itevery fucking day. And that's what they don't get. What builds a human being is youstart with the small building blocks. And before you know it,man, you become something that it doesn't evenmake sense to most people because it's justwho you are now. That's why I can stillrun at 50 with broke-- at 49 with broke downknees and broke down body because my bodyknows you still can. Therefore, I do. Second you stop, thewillpower is gone. And that's beautiful. I'm so glad you brought that tome because I always wondered, what's thisseparation thing now? At 24 years old, Istarted building something that I didn't evenknow was going to be what it is now at 49. And that's all it was. It was just that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: This structure,anterior mid-cingulate cortex, has inputs and outputsfrom a bunch of places. But you'll probably notbe surprised to learn that it's strongly activatedwhen we move our body when we don't want to move our body. I feel like it's like theDavid Goggins structure. DAVID GOGGINS: It really is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It is. And it also hasstrong connections to the dopamine reward pathway. And everyone goes,yay, dopamine. Everyone loves dopamine. I'm partially responsiblefor people knowing a bit more about dopamine. But dopamine's badly understood. Everyone thinksdopamine, dopamine hits. It's about reward. It's about motivation and drive. And there are pain inputs to thedopamine centers of the brain. No one talks about that. Everyone's like, oh, you wantthe chocolate, chocolate, sex, cocaine. Yeah, that's all true. It'll release dopamine. Pain releases dopamine. The anteriormid-cingulate cortex can trigger the releaseof dopamine in response to this thing thatwe're calling friction. And that's a learned thing. That's something thatno animal or human being comes into the world learning. We all are averse to pain. And like pleasure,like sugar, fat. Don't like hot surfaces. But this is astructure that learns. It has neuroplasticity,the ability to change throughoutthe entire life span. And here's thepart that I think, again, is just neuro nerdspeak for what you already know and have done and exemplify,is that people say, oh, it has plasticity. You can change it. But guess what? It has plasticityin both directions. It can grow. But just as easily as it cangrow, it's like Silly Putty, it can shrink. So it requires constant upkeep. And that answer isn't onethat people are going to like. They're like, giveme the energy drink. Give me the supplement. Give me the-- give methe sauna protocol that's going to make my anteriormid-cingulate cortex-- there's someone out thereright now who's going, wait, if I took transcranialmagnetic stimulation and I stimulate-- yeah, you'dprobably-- actually, they've done that. They stuck a littlewire during neurosurgery into this structure. This was actuallydiscovered by a colleague of mine, Joe Parvizi. Stimulate. And the patients go, I feellike there's a storm coming. And they go, oh, is it scary? And they go, no, Iwant to go through it. They come off the stimulation,and people are like-- this is the seat of whatwe're talking about. DAVID GOGGINS: Right. Exactly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And it learns. So the fact that you'vekept this brain structure-- I'm convinced if we imagedyour brain, it'd be large, and it would be largerin two years, in a year. But this is the no days offrationale because it can grow, and it can shrink. DAVID GOGGINS: I know. What you're saying right now,I didn't know any of this. And I never-- and Ialways talk to you. But I wish I couldjust put this on paper. And you're saying it in a waythat people can understand. I can never put it intowords on what I built and the power thatis within all of us. But you put it soin a scientific way. Most people, forme, he's just crazy. That's why I don't liketalking about it, man. I know I'm not crazy. I know what I had to doto get where I had to go. People look at it as crazybecause there are people that just-- if you can't imagineyourself doing something, if you can't imagineyourself doing something, the person that'sdoing it is crazy because in your mind, the logicbehind it, it doesn't compute. Therefore, you have togive somebody a title. And the title for meis usually he's crazy or he's this, he's that. No. No. For some reason, mewanting to be somebody so fucking bad in mylife, I created that. And I've beentrying to figure out years of my life tryingto explain to people. But even though you'reexplaining it now, this is the easy fucking part. Them listening to this shitis the easy fucking part. The part that why they'realways be the ones of ones is because puttingthat practice, putting that intoactual work, no, man. No. No. That's where the demons come in. That's where you're like,I don't want to be better. I don't want to be better. If this is what ittakes to be better, I don't want to be better. So everybody's-- that's whythere's a lot of average. And it makes me so fucking mad. Every day I walk thisEarth, and I see average all over the fucking place. And they want to askme, how did you do it? I can't tell you how becauseyou're not going to fucking-- you're not going to do it. You're not going to do it you. You're just going to-- You're going to continuebeing like this every day you wake up. Like you said, it'slike, get the coffee. Make the pancakes. Kiss the girl. Kiss the kids. You wake up, right to work. Immediate, yourmind is in action. No one wants to do that. No one. And I don't blame them. But don't be mad whenyou're laying there in your fucking bed, andyou're in the fucking hospital, and you're 70, 80, 90 years old. And you're thinking,man, I feel like I didn't fucking do something. Because you did. You didn't do it. You didn't do shit. You may have liveda great life, man, but you're always goingto feel empty inside. I don't feel empty. So call me what you want. There's not one emptybone in my fucking body because I have figuredout that really-- the magic potion,at least to my life. And it's very rewarding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd liketo take a quick break and thank our sponsor,InsideTracker. InsideTracker is apersonalized nutrition platform that analyzes datafrom your blood and DNA to help me betterunderstand your body and help you reachyour health goals. I've long been a believer ingetting regular blood work done for the simple reason thatmany of the factors that impact your immediate andlong-term health can only be analyzed froma quality blood test. Now, a major problemwith a lot of blood tests out there, however,is that you get information back about metabolicfactors, lipids, and hormones and so forth. But you don't know what todo with that information With InsideTracker,they make it very easy, because they have apersonalized platform, that allows you to seethe levels of all those things, metabolic factors,lipids, hormones, et cetera. But it gives youspecific directives that you can follow thatrelate to nutrition, behavioral modification,supplements, et cetera thatcan help you bring those numbers into the rangesthat are optimal for you. If you'd like totry InsideTracker, you can go toinsidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off any ofInsideTracker's plans. Again, that'sinsidetracker.com/huberman. People like to talk about whatthey used to be able to do. I hear this a lot. You should have seenme in high school. I always laugh. Like, yeah, OK. Got it. And it's not just guys. You should have seen meworking out in high school. I was super fit. People will lookback to a time where they felt like they werecapable of something. And now they're not. And you kind of want tojust grab them and go, wait. That was you then. It's you now. And but people tendto think about how the conditions thatwere around success must have been part of it. And you can understand why. It's very rational. I was in that situation. I was successful. I'm in this situation. I'm not. That was the past. This is the present. Ergo, capable. You see how peopleget into these loops. And as you mentioned, you spentthe first 20 years of your life in extremely challengedcircumstances. And then you can see howpeople get to a point where everything feels hard. Like, when you're 300 pounds-- I haven't ever been 300 pounds. But I can't imagine it feelsgood to get up and move around. DAVID GOGGINS: It's defeating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I got a friend. He's in excess of 300 pounds. We've been tryingon him for years. But no win. And he's got crazy psoriasison the back of his calves. And he actuallysmells bad sometimes because he can't washas well as he would. He's big, big. And it pulls all my sympathy. But life is very hard forhim and getting worse. He's a young guy witha lot of medical issues now, for obvious reasons. And so I think people like thatthink, well, it's already hard. Why would I make it harder? Your message is alittle different. And you have thelife experience. DAVID GOGGINS: It'sa lot different. ANDREW HUBERMAN:You've been there. So for me, saying, ohyeah, lose weight-- I was a skinny guy who gotto be a less skinny guy. So I don't really havea foot to stand on. What do you say to thosepeople who are like, listen, getting up inthe morning is hard. Trying to not dissolve intoa puddle of my own tears and my own misery is hard. DAVID GOGGINS: You know whypeople connect with my books so well? For some reason, God put mein almost every fucked up situation on the planet Earth. So when I talk to people,it's not sugar-coated because I'm not saying it from Iwas a 175 pounds my whole life. I don't say muchto those people. Maybe you're a piece of shit. Maybe you want to be nobody. Maybe you're happy exactlywhere you are in life because obviously, you are. Maybe you don't havethe determination to be somebody betterthan who you are. And if you want to live withthat, I'll support you in that. If you're good with being whoyou are, that every day you wake up, and every day, yousmell like shit because you can't wash your body well,and your skin is messed up because your health'sso bad, and you can't put your clothes onright, you need help with that. You need help like--when I was 300 pounds, I needed help wiping my ass. That makes you feel good? Nothing I can say to you. If every day you wake up withthis-- see, people are haunted. But they obviouslylike horror films because they keep watchingthe same fucking movie. I don't like horror films. A lot of peoplelike horror films. So I don't say much to them. I say exactly what Isaid to you right there because I was once you. I didn't like horrorfilms, so I changed it. Some people are just-- they become-- like yousaid, it gets real small when you're lazy andyou're fat, your will. Their will is so smallthat they don't have any. And you can't give it to them. There has to besomething-- this is what I'm talking about nowbecause this isn't a hack. This has to be in you. Something in you has to wake up. And usually, the only personthat can wake it up is you. Sometimes you can reada David Goggins book because I was all this shit andthen a lot more of fucked up. But if you don't have alittle flame, just barely-- you're done. I can't light it for you. And that's the harshreality of this life that I want to getacross so fucking bad. You can watch me. You can watch you. You can watch fuckingRogan and Cameron Hanes, all these motherfuckers. You can go to TonyRobbins's fucking bullshit, all this shit. You can do all this shit. You're going to keepgoing back and keep spending money andspending money and spending money with no results. You're going to wonder, wow. Maybe let me go tryout David Goggins. He ain't going tofucking help you. You have to explore, examinethe insides of yourself. And what do you reallywant out of life? Your friend and a lotof people out here just don't fucking want it. So guess what? Have fun with your life. Go from 300 to 350to 400 to 450 to 500 because you don't want it. And that's the harsh reality. I can't give you shit. You can't give them shit. We can give you ideas. But end of the day, whenI was losing the weight, I had to miserably wake upevery morning in the cold because it was Indiana,November, when it started. I was miserable. This is your new life. Take it or leave it. There's no happiness about it. There's no peace behind it. It sucks. It just fucking sucks. And that's the one thing, if Icould teach anybody anything, it just fucking sucks. And it's going tocontinue to suck. And then one day, you'll getto a special part in your life that it might get alittle bit better. But to lose the weight youhave to lose, my friend, sorry. It's going to suck everyfucking day because then when you're 300 pounds, you'regoing to go out to lose weight, you could probably get injured. So then you got towork on the injury. And then you geteven more depressed. This is what I went through. And then you're hungrybecause now you're depressed. It's just a vicious cycle. And if you're notstrong mentally and you have nowillpower, you're going to continuefalling back in this hole versus the man thatsits back and goes, all right, motherfucker. This is why I cuss becausethis is what is in me. This is what it tookfor me to be me. Sorry. It didn't take, hey, OK,we're going to do this today. No. This fucking really sucks. This is real, dude. This is real. And every day, I'm set back. I'm set back. I'm set back. I'm set back. So this is what Iwould tell your boy. This is exactlywhat I'd tell him. Every day you wake up,you're going to probably be set back for thefirst four weeks before you lose significantweight because the mind is going to be fuckingwith you the whole time. There's no dopamine. There's no dopamine inthere at 300 pounds. You got nothing. Your hormones are shot. You have to envision somethingthat is more powerful than you. Something has toget you out of bed. And you have to create it. It has to be falsebecause you're not it. You're a fat piece of shit. And that's the reality of it. So you have to create a falsereality, to live in that just to get to work on yourself. That's the reality. ANDREW HUBERMAN: He'llsee this, and he'll appreciate that message. We'll see what he does. DAVID GOGGINS: We'll see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So far, last13 years, it's been no movement. But I have had otherfriends who were drug and alcohol addicts whoquit after one conversation. Never went back. DAVID GOGGINS: That's awesome. That means they want it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, justone guy, I won't out him, but walked up to me at aparty in 2019, July 4th party, and said, I'm a pile. And I go, what? And he goes, I'm a pile. Look at me. I'm 60 pounds overweight. And I go, do you drink? He goes, every day. I go, how much? He goes, a case. He goes, I smoke a lot of weed. But he's successful inother areas of his life. And so I said, well,here's what I know. Quit alcohol and weed for you. I'm not tellingpeople what to do. Don't eat until 2:00 PM. Get on an exercisebike, and pedal in the morning like someone'schasing you with a poison dart until you want to puke. And I was kind of half-joking. And then two monthslater, he was, like, I haven't had a drink. I lost 30 pounds. He lost those 60 pounds. He never went back. Now, he's super fit. It's amazing. So some people flip the switch. He is veryself-critical by nature. DAVID GOGGINS:That's what flips-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: He'ssuper self-critical. DAVID GOGGINS: Yep. That's what flips the switch. Think about it, man. We know what to do. We don't need Andrew Hubermanto tell us what to do. We know what to do,every one of us. That's why he flipped it sofast because he knew what to do. He didn't go byyour exact protocol. He didn't go by the exact-- no. He knew exactly what to do. And you just saying some shitto him, it woke something up. He knew what to do. And that's the thing thatpeople need to get that. You know what to do. Why aren't you doing it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: And I'mtalking about myself now. Those modes of just kindof passive consumption, they're so easy to wash over us. I used to have this thing,and I'm fighting this now because I knew we weregoing to have this conversation today, where I liketo start things on the hour or the half hour. Worst practice inthe world for me because if I miss that halfhour, I'm like, oh, it's 12:33. I'll start at 12:45. Ah, it's 12:45. I'll start at 1:00. I just lost time. And so this is so stupid. And the other day,I was like, man, I got to tell David about thisbecause my new thing is I start no matter what time it is. If I wake up in themiddle of the night-- I got a friend. He paints in themiddle of the night. I'm like, you're an insomniac? He's like, I don't know. I just do it. Then sometimes hegoes back to sleep. Sometimes he doesn't. Everyone's got their thing. But I thought about this. I'm like, no more am Igoing to say I'm starting at 1:00 because I know me. If I miss the 1:00 ding and thenmy pen's not hitting the paper or I'm not typingon the keyboard, I'm not going to do it. But That's aself-admitted weakness. DAVID GOGGINS: I love it, man. I had that for a lot of years. I know I'm going to do it. That's the haunting part isthat it's going to happen. It has to happen. And that's a fact. Like, there's no get outof jail free card, bro. None. Like, that is a lifethat I don't know. I don't have that ability. Or I have the ability. I don't have the-- I'm not good enough,smart enough. I'm not talentedenough to do that. Some people are. Some people can start at 1:00. Some people don'thave to start at all. If you lack talent, youcan't sit back and say, I'll start in half an hour. I can't do that. I got to start now. And after I get back fromstarting, I got to start again. And then when I get done withthat run or that study session, if it wasn't good enough,I got to go back again because repetition iswhat taught me everything. So you can honestlyoutwork anything. But it's that you, obviously,are a very talented man. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I haveworked hard at certain things and built up somethings that I've been good at most of my life. DAVID GOGGINS: You're amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Gathering,organizing, and disseminating information'ssomething I've been doing since I was a little kid. I used to give lectures atschool on Monday about stuff I learned over the weekend. DAVID GOGGINS: See,check that out. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But theytook me to a psychiatrist. We're the same age. Back then, if you gotsent to a psychiatrist, people thought you were crazy. DAVID GOGGINS: I was one. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, exactly. DAVID GOGGINS: I was one. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Exactly. So I rememberfeeling like a freak. Also, I didn't have a stutter,but I had a grunting tic. It comes back when I'm tired. And the only thing thathelped that was hitting my head on something,shaking my head, which is why skateboardingwas good because I'd slam, and I'd feel like, oh. I feel good. But that's not healthy. That's not good. Or just work. Work is what gets it out. It's like an-- it'slike an RPM or high. [REVVING SOUND]Anyway, that's me. But yeah, I thinkcertain things over time, I feel like talent or gifts orwhatever you want to call them, but there are manythings that are exceedingly difficult for me. And I have learnedfrom your example. I know that you are veryboth humble and very clear that you don't have--you say, you're not going to get itby examining you. But I think the wayyou're sharing today and the way you've sharedit on other podcasts before, there are piecesthat really help people feel intothe process of what you're talking about today. We're elaborating on it, Ithink, a lot, this notion of being haunted and the stick. I mean, of course, of course,now it makes so much sense why you don't want to talk aboutsleep or rest or recovery because that's-- sure, that's important. I've heard you say,yes, you sleep. Yes, you eat. Yes, you hydrate. Yes, you will stretchyour psoas or whatever. But it's funny how thatbecomes the viral message. DAVID GOGGINS: That's whyI said fuck that today. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Butthat's not the unique-- that's not the uniquemessage that you carry. Like, anyone cantalk about that. So do I have that right? That you're acknowledgingsleep is important. Recovery is important. DAVID GOGGINS: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But that'snot what you're about. DAVID GOGGINS: You haveto forego something. Yes. Ice baths. Saunas. Sleep. Nutrition. All this shit's sofucking important, dude. I don't have timefor some of it. To extract what I had toextract, something had to give. Like, you talk about youwhen you were younger. You would give thesespeeches and stuff. The same age youwere giving speeches, I was trying to figure out howto say the without stuttering. And I realized, as I got older,that all these things are important. But for me to stopstuttering, I got to build fucking confidence. And speech therapydidn't help that. Nothing helped that. I have to forgo a lot ofshit to be as fucked up as I am to buildconfidence, for me to stand in a fucking room of10,000-- of one person, and not [STUTTERING SOUNDS] and belike, oh, and put my head down. Let me look around. Let me read theseparagraphs first. And then before Iread the paragraphs, because they'recalling me next, let me just leave the roombecause I'm going to stutter. That's a miserable life. And that's one of manythings I did besides lying, besides being insecure,besides being immature, besides being fat, besidesbeing one of the only Black kids in my school. There's a lot of things I hadto overcome to gain confidence. And in doing so, alot of that had to go. A lot of it. So I became the guy that became,once again, misunderstood. You only sleep four hoursa day, two hours a day? Sometimes youdon't sleep at all? Like, what's this, andwhat's this, and what's this? I know it's all important. I can't. Something's got to go. For me to get confidence,because confidence is the building block ofwhere I'm trying to go, for me to gainconfidence in myself, this fucked up kid has gotto do a lot of fucked up shit to gain confidence. And along the way,the stutter went away. And I gained confidence. And now, my life isa little bit more-- there is no balance. There is no balance. It's a little bit more what itshould be for a lot of people. But there'll never be balancebecause confidence is something that you're constantly-- confidence and beliefyou're building every day. And so something's got to give. And I'm willing toforego a lot of things to have that becauseI know if you want to givesomebody kryptonite, take that shit away from them. So yeah, I don'tsleep sometimes. And sometimes I don'teat the right way. And sometimes I don't do thisand do that and whatever, man. But you put me in a roomof 10,000 people any time of the day, and I'llwalk in there thinking I'm the baddestmotherfucker in here because I know what ittook to be on this stage. And a lot of peoplewould not do that. So that's what it takes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:There's a question I've been wanting to askyou since we started. And I thought aboutcoming in here. And I've been thinking aboutin the weeks ahead of this. And I'm going to just comeclean and say I don't exactly know how to ask the question. DAVID GOGGINS: Just ask it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It'sabout relationships. DAVID GOGGINS: Oh, do it, man. ANDREW HUBERMAN:So I know in myself that my discipline is muchhigher when it's just me. But that's because I hadcertain things early on. But then I was aterrible student. Barely finished high school. But then when I gotserious, I got serious. But I did that by stayingaway from everybody. And anyone's who's ever hada relationship of any kind, but in particular,romantic relationships, knows that, yes, you can derivetremendous support from those. Like, you got this, baby. You can go. And you're like, yeah. I got this. She said I got this. Feels great to finish somethingand share with someone, share a meal, get the hug. But there's anotherside to all of that that I'd like to learnmore about from you, which is there's awarm body next to you in bed in the morning. You don't want to get up. They also have needs. You've got your missionthat people sometimes need things from us. But also, oftentimes,the people that love us most, that truly loveus and that want to support us, don't understand this thing. And they're the first peopleto tell us, like, listen. Take a day off. And then this whole cycle,at least in my head, goes off, like, youjust want a vacation. And then it's almostlike a paranoia. I'm not saying anythingnice about myself right now. DAVID GOGGINS: All good, man. ANDREW HUBERMAN:Former girlfriends are going to be like, yeah. Like, they remember that. And so support of peopleclose to you is critical. This could be friends. Could be romantic partners. Whatever. But they're also-- theknife cuts both ways. It can be the thingthat can really undermine this thing that you'retalking about because people that care about us alsowant to see us comfortable. They want to see us happy. They want to see us peaceful. They want to see us wake upfrom a great night's sleep. And they want things too. So how do you untanglethat whole bit? DAVID GOGGINS: Well,it's funny, man. I'm unbalanced, butI'm mostly unbalanced towards the family side, whichpeople don't get about me. I'll start being unbalanced. I get all my stuff in. But what I do is I make surethat my family has everything they need, everythingthey need, those who want to be part of my family. Some don't. Some family members don't wantto be part of David Goggins. I get it. I got it. That's life. Those who are partof my family, I give them everythingthey need so they can leave me the fuck alone. I make sure you're happy as fuckbecause I got to go to work. And I don't mean smokejumping. I don't mean running. I mean all of it. It takes every-- I can't have youin my fucking shit. I can't. So I know for meto have a family, I gotta make sure that yourealize I'm going to give you everything you need. So when you startbitching at me, I'm going to say, look, hang on. I dedicated my life to giveyou everything you need. I need this timeright here for me to be the best I can bebecause this journey started without anybody. And I make sure everybody knowsthat who comes in my life. I've been left-- think about it. I was left alone at a youngage to figure this shit out. I figured it out for myselfand have been very successful for myself. No one's going to come inhere and fuck with my shit. That's why I make sure I willtake care of whatever you need. Whatever you needfrom me, you got it. Money, house, mylove, my support, I'm going to give youeverything you need. That said, I do it thehighest level possible. And I'm saying that withJennifer in the next room. So please come hereand say something if it's wrong, Jennifer. I don't give a fuck. Say what you got to say. So then when it's timefor me to go to work, I expect you todo the same for me because it takes every bit ofme to do what I have to do. So I make sure that I'm veryunbalanced from my family so I can be exactly thatunbalanced for myself. And that's how I do it. I let people knowright up front, I'm not what you want in a man. I guarantee that. There's going to bea lot of late nights, a lot of earlymornings, a lot of times where I got to be by myselfthinking about the process that is next in my mind. I can't have aggravation. I can't have this. Can't have that. There's a lot of things. But I let them know up front. I'm very vocal about that. Sometimes relationshipswork for me. Sometimes they didn't. But that's who I am. One thing I did wrong in my lifewas I tried for so many years to please people. And I did it at theexpense of myself. I was leaving a lot in the tank. And when you do that,you stop living. But the person in yourlife is happy as fuck because you're givingthem everything they want. They have their--their life is full. But you feel empty. And that's not arelationship to me. So for me, it'simportant that you know exactly who I am becausethis is what life made. And I'm not trying to change itbecause I just figured it out. So I'm not trying tocompromise David Goggins. I would never, evercompromise David Goggins. That doesn't mean I won'tgive you what you need and what you wantand what you desire. But I don't need money. I don't need fame. I don't need shit. So I give it all away. What I do need is to make surethat that willpower is worked on every fucking day and everynight for the rest of my life because that's theone thing that's going to keep me feeding you,keeping you where you need to be, because oncethat willpower is gone, 300-pound David Goggins,he may not look like it, but I will walk around with it. So the things that areimportant to you in life, you must do always. Or you're nobody. And that's how Ihandle relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amen to that. Something I couldpersonally work on is that upfront,clear communication because it resonates thatfeeling of there's something inside that's not getting workedout that, when I'm on my own, it's a lot easier. But then, of course, wantingrelationships and family, I think that's a healthypart of being human too. And obviously,you've worked it out. So I appreciateyou sharing that. I don't think I'veever heard you talk about it that way before. DAVID GOGGINS: People arescared of that conversation with their wife, husband,girlfriend, boyfriend. But why are you scared of it? Why are you scared to tella motherfucker, your wife, your husband, who you are, whoyou are, exactly who you are? And that was the problemI had-- that's a problem that a lot of us have in life. No one knows who you really are. No one knew who I really was. I went to a school where therewere a lot of Black kids. A lot of Black kids didn'twant to be in special ops. I never talked aboutspecial ops to Black kids. Why? I was wondering what-- I'm not going to fit in. That's not what they do. A lot of Black kids don'tdo that kind of shit. So whatever I wantedto do, no one really knew the real me growing upbecause I never wanted anybody to know the real me. I was always afraidof what you might say or how you're goingto feel or whatever. You got feelings. You have a life thatyou have to live. So it's important thatwhatever's on your mind, you let that person know. Therefore, you'regiving them the option to be with you or not. This is who I am. If you don't likeit, that's good, man. I got it. But this is David Goggins. So that honest conversationis very important, man, so everybody knowswhere they stand. That person may not be for you. And that's all good. ANDREW HUBERMAN:This world could use a lot more of that upfront,completely honest conversation. I feel like so much ofthe world's problems are because everyone'sdancing around these issues. DAVID GOGGINS: It takes a lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:Recently in the news, seeing people losingtheir job because they won't say something publicly. You can tell theykind of what it. It's like, people just,I think, deep down really crave the direct message. Like, what are you about? What are you not about? But I think now, everyone'safraid of getting canceled. It's a big deal, gettingcanceled, that people think, oh, I can't workif I am who I am. Or if I'm not pretendingto be somebody else, then silence isconsidered agreement. There's all sorts ofcomplicated stuff. And I do feel for thegeneration coming up because we didn't havesocial media and all of that. Again, just walledoff from that. There's a real benefit fromjust not paying attention. DAVID GOGGINS:People love to lie. People love to lie. You know, I thoughtI was only a person-- when I was growingup, I thought I was the only person that liedbecause I lived in a bubble. And people love to lieabout who they're not. They love to lie aboutwho they're not, dude. And that's, for me, thereason why I'm so vulnerable, and I'm so real and honest. Find somebody tocome out and tell me I'm lying about my fucking life. And for me to comewhere I came from and have the resumeI have now, you know the confidence you get? How I don't care who--you're going to-- you're going to judge me? You're going to judge me? What have you done in your life? So me, being so honest andso upfront and so truthful, that came with me finallyfiguring out who I was, but also conquering DavidGoggins, the demons of David Goggins. Therefore, now, you'rejust an open book. You look at somebody, lookthem right in the eye. Tell me exactly whothe fuck you are. You walk away. I'm good, bro, because I knowexactly what this journey took to get here. And that gives you a fireand a passion that people can call you nigger,they can call you-- if you're a lesbian orgay or bise-- call me whatever the fuck you want. If you put yourself inthe fire and you come out every fucking day like this,brush it off, not scared to go back in thereagain, come on, man. Your truth is real. You come out everyday, man, with a way of talking to people that peopledon't have because there's no truth behind them. And the truth isthe starting line. When you sit down the uglymirror and say, I'm this, I'm this, I'm this and this,you finally started your life. Maybe 40 years old. Maybe 40 years old,five, six kids, wife. But the second you look in thatmirror and you say, I'm this, I'm this, I'm this, I'm this,I'm this, well, basically, I'm not this, I'm not this,I'm not this, I can't do this, I can't do this, I'mall these insecurities, your life finally started. And once you start thatlife, man, the truth comes out big time becauseyou no longer care. So that's the problem. Most people just don't wantto have that conversation to the point where they can goon stage and a million people and say, I'm all of this. And have a good day. See you. It's empowering. It's very empowering. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I feel like theway we're educated in school, but also outside of school, iswe're trained, as human being, as these young brains,to try and figure out how to get positivefeedback from other people. It's like we're little dogs. You have a bulldog. DAVID GOGGINS: That's right. ANDREW HUBERMAN:I had a bulldog. Saw the picture of your bulldog. She's great. DAVID GOGGINS: Charlie dog. ANDREW HUBERMAN: They'rean amazing species. DAVID GOGGINS: They are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I thinkof them economy of effort or amazing breed, excuse me. They're an amazing breed. Economy of effort. They don't do anythingunless it's necessary. It's the exact opposite ofeverything we're talking about. It's kind of interesting. And they're kind of hedonists. Now, it is true thatthey'll die to protect you. DAVID GOGGINS: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Andit's an instinct. I saw that with Costello. I'm sure that-- DAVID GOGGINS: Isaw it with Charlie. Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:It's an instinct. But if they're notin that position, if there's no needto exert effort-- DAVID GOGGINS: They're resting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. So your bulldog'sresting for you. DAVID GOGGINS: Yes. Got it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Exactly. So you don't needto rest because-- DAVID GOGGINS: Activerecovery Charlie. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Perfect. DAVID GOGGINS: That's it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Perfect. That's going to be youranswer from now on. People go, does he sleep? Does he rest? Go, no. He somehow worked it out sohis bulldog does it for him. DAVID GOGGINS: Right. ANDREW HUBERMAN:But we're sort of indoctrinated intothis way of being from a time that we'reyoung, where, of course, praise feels good. Someone tells you, hey, I likethat shirt, or good job today, or nicely done. Or for me, because growing upin a big pack of friends growing up, and I was never the greatestathlete, wasn't terrible, wasn't great, et cetera, like,a fist bump, or, like, feeling crewed up. And you're just like, yeah. But you've talked aboutthis before in reference to the SEAL Teams. We both know a lot ofpeople in that community. And the Teams component is a bigpart of it for a lot of people. And it's a wonderful thing. But there's a dangerto that dopamine hit, for lack of a betterway to put it, from we can only derive whenit's coming from the outside. You're talking about beingable to either say, good job, but also, just look to one'sown personal history and say, I've done hard things. And I can do it again and againbecause I do it again and again and again. You're talking about parentingyourself, inspiring yourself, scaring yourself, allof that from the inside. So very differentthan the way we're raised, which is to figureout how to get the biscuit. DAVID GOGGINS: It's funny, man. People want to know howI'm always motivated. It's the unseen work, which youjust said is a true statement. Those are false dopaminehits that people are giving you, man. There's no belief in that. These are teamworkdopamine-- like, I'm out running at 2 o'clockin the morning, 1 o'clock in the morning in thegym, long sessions by myself. That's real. I'm able to extract dopamine,the good dopamine whenever I want. Man, I've trained99% of my life alone. No one patted me on the back. I did all of the work alone. And while I'm still hard onmyself, I know what I did. So whenever timesget bad for me, people are all this, who's goingto carry the boats and lo-- that's real. I hate that peopleknow me for that guy because that guy isnot every fucking day. When they see me,they want that energy. That's not me every day. I can extract itimmediately when I need to because when you train alone-- and I lived alone for somany years in this misery. And you're able toget out by yourself. I can take myself to sucha level of real passion and purpose. And the feeling Iget is something I can't even explain by mys-- I don't need anyone. That's why people cometo me to motivate them. No one can motivate me. I have a resume fullof fucking motivation that whenever I'm down, I'mlike, oh hang on, motherfucker. Oh, you know the truth. You know the truth. You know the darknessof the fucking dungeons and the fucking demons that fly. And then from there,it's like, OK. You were there. You know this. There was no onethere to pick up the rucksack, to pickup the boat, to pick up the log, to go in there. It was you. It was you. There was no pat on the fuckingback at 300, at 275, at 250, at 220. No. That was you. So those thingsthat come out of me, that extract from mein the darkness, people are looking for thatpat on the back. Where is it? Oh, I don't need itbecause what I've done is in the fucking unseen work. I built Frankenstein. So whenever shit getsnasty, David Goggins goes, you had nobodyanyway, motherfucker. So see how I'm talkingto myself right now? That's me. That's shit firesme the fuck up. That shit makes me fucking nuts. You had nobodyanyway, motherfucker. Look around you. There was no fucking team. It was you. There was no weight loss programor mom and dad waking you up, saying you can do it, you can bebetter, trying to build belief. You built beliefwhen you had nothing. Rock bottom. You did that. So as times get hard forme, the truth comes out. And my truth ispowerful as fuck. It's real. It's tangible. I feel it. It comes out of my brainas I speak about it. I'm reliving every single darkmoment of my life to be here. So that is whatpeople don't get. That is what motivates DavidGoggins is the unseen work. But everybody needsthat pat on the back. They need that training partner. They need thataccountability coach. I don't need that shit. And neither do they. But it's what we'vetrained ourselves to believe that we need. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It'salmost like there's this pill on the shelf. I'm speaking in analogy. And we take it, andwe get jazzed up. And we're like, yeah. But there's this othermedicine cabinet behind there. And it's in us. You're saying the realmedicine cabinet is inside. DAVID GOGGINS: Oh, yes. When you continue to overcome-- and I had so manyobstacles to overcome. So it's actuallya benefit to me. But the benefit, it's notlike a benefit like that. You have to have thecourage and the patience to overcome and overcome. Before you know it, man, youhave a whole medicine cabinet. But there's no medicinein the motherfucker. There's no pre-workout. I don't take none of that shit. All I got to dois flip my brain. Put my finger in there andsay, OK, that's a good one. It's all I got to do, man. I got the Rolodex. I'm just like, go fuckyourself, Goggins. And oh, but you won. Let's do that one today. There's nothing I need. And this is thething that people don't get about David Goggins. I can't teach it ina 1-minute video. We all have this ability tohave our own medicine cabinet. But unless you go in thereand put the medicine in there, it's always going tobe fucking empty, man. You're always going toneed the pre-workout. You're alwaysgoing to need the-- I don't drink coffee. I don't do ca-- I don't do none of that. I don't need it. I can run for 70 hours, andI have before, no caffeine. I got all this wonderful shitthat I overcame on my own, by myself, in the darkness,that, man, when it's cold, I'm hot. When it's hot-- I can feed myself all the time. That's why when peoplesay, man, why aren't you missing anything, I can'texplain it to you, man. Can't explain it to you. You'll never understand. That's why I don't doall these podcasts, dude. I love you, man. That's why you-- my firstbook, you did a blurb for me. That's why I'm here. I love what you'redoing for people, man. But I can't explain this. I can't. I can't explain this becausepeople don't want to do this. They don't want to do this, man. But I don't know, man. I get jazzed up eventalking about it, man, because so many peoplethink my life is just so, oh god, his life is horrible. Don't follow him. He's crazy. Really? ANDREW HUBERMAN: But thereare a good number of people, I would say, and that's anunder-- that actually do. I think what I'm hearing today,and it's really sinking in, is that a great many peopleeither partially or completely misunderstand you. DAVID GOGGINS: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'll put myselfin the partially category. DAVID GOGGINS: Big time. ANDREW HUBERMAN:Because I thought it was about just forwardcenter of mass, carrot, carrot, carrot, carrot. But it's the stick. DAVID GOGGINS: It's the stick. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Andit's being haunted. And you know, I do have examplesfrom my own life, which is not what today is about,about being really afraid and then turning things around. My biggest fear isgetting comfortable. I do not have as much ofa stick-oriented approach. But today's conversation'schanging the way I think. I'm not going tostep away from this and think, OK, there are25 neural circuits that can explain 10 of the thingsthat David's talking about. And what I'm thinkingabout is the fact that everybody has a brain. They have a mind. Forget the brain. The brain's just thephysical structure. But what that manifests, whatthat creates is the mind. And everybody has that. So I do believe thateveryone has the capacity to do what you're talkingabout at some level. I also will be thefirst to confess that I think youare highly unusual. Let's just say maybe even nof 1, as we say in science. Sample size of one. Somebody who has createdthis process for themselves and keeps them inthis-- themselves in this forward centerof mass with the stick battering the back oftheir head all the time. Highly unusual. But this internalmedicine cabinet that you're talkingabout building up, true confidence, not needinganything from the outside, I like to think thatpeople want that. They want to be known. They're afraid. But that they want to beknown for who they really are and that you're describingthe path to do this. And I will say I'm immenselygrateful that you're talking to us thisway today about things that you've talked about before. But we're hitting it a littledifferently, I like to think. DAVID GOGGINS: Very differently. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Becausewhat you're talking about is a process. It's verbs. It's all verbs. DAVID GOGGINS: All action. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Andit's not about success. It's more, actually,about keeping that friction dialed to 10. And no energy drink,no supplement. People often misunderstand me. They think-- like, I'm bigon people getting sunlight in the morning so theyset their circadian rhythm and get better sleep andso they can-- et cetera. But then people alwaysthink-- they go straight to the supplements. What should I take? And then, ofcourse, people think I'm all about supplements. And supplements areone piece for me. But it's like tiny fractioncompared to the doing, the do's and don'ts. DAVID GOGGINS:That's why I didn't want to talk about that today. That's why I'm gladwe're talking about this. This is it. This is it. Like, the brain is the mostpowerful weapon in the world. And it's crazy how a kidthat wasn't real smart, I was forced togo only internal. External had to go away. The external worldhad to go away. In living so deep insidemyself, it was me in this brain and figuring out howthis thing works. And so many people are doingexactly that, the supplements, the this, the that. And I agree, it helps. But once you figureout your brain, you become unstoppableto almost anything. Yeah, you can't beat death. You can't whatever, whatever. Your brain is amazing. Once you feed it the rightconversation, the right mental nutrients, the rightmental supplements, the right internaldialogue at the right time with the right hit, with theright proof of what you've done in the past, andyou send that right to the right circuit, dude,you're a fucking beast. A beast. But once again, you justcan't read about it. You can't sit backand be a theorist. You have to be afucking practitioner. And in that practice is wherethat becomes proof-positive of what I'm saying. It's like, god, DavidGoggins is blowing my mind. What is this? He's not crazy. And so many people,a lot of people, have listened tome the right way. And they come back, and they'relike, I'm totally on board. It happened. It happened. I'm like, it'll keep going,man, if you keep doing it. But that is it, man. There's no sun. There's no glory. There's no carrot. There's no victory. But there is all of it in one. I just can't explain itreal well to people, man. But what you get theother end is something that you're always found. You're never lost anymore. Doesn't mean thejourney is easy. Doesn't get any easier. But you're always found. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love that. I just want to hoveron that for a sec the same way we hoveredon haunted and the stick. I think people feel lost. I've certainly felt lost attimes in my life, many times. And yeah, there's that thing. I don't think there's aneuroscience or a psychology term for it. Someone will put it in thecomments and say, oh yeah, that's what so-and-so said. But like you said, we're nottrying to be theoretical here. We're trying to be practical. The business of findingyourself and knowing, oh. But it's sort of like I'msafe because I'm in danger, and I've been in dangerbefore, and I got myself out. It always seems tocome back to verbs. Again, I don't havea language for this. For once, I'm lost for words. There's like-- it's abouta process, the algorithm. And the reason-- here, I'm justkind of trying to make sure I'm understandingthings correctly. One of the reasons whyit must be uncomfortable for you to be whoyou are publicly is because people want to focuson the running or the swearing. And by the way, theswearing is welcome. I'll tell you, I cameup through laboratories where all three people Iworked for swore a lot. But there was one rule. I couldn't swear at people. So my graduate advisor,brilliant woman, unfortunately, she diedearly, they all died early-- I'm the common denominator. I had that internalizedfor a long time. Anyway, she said, but if youswear at people, you're out. But you can swearas much as you want. So that's the rule I have. It's like, you can swearas much as you want. Just don't swear at people. And if you swear at people,better be ready to fight. Definitely notgoing to fight you. So you can swear atme, get away with it. But the fact of thematter is that it must be frustrating that people-- because I knowpeople go, oh, it's all about supplementsand ice baths. Listen, I like supplements. I love supplementsand ice baths. But that's not the full picture. It's just a gravitational pull. It's the swearing. It's the running. It's his feet thatare all messed up. It's the fact thathe got a Triton. He's a SEAL guy. Talk about that too. And there's a gravitationalpull for people. And they're missing-- that'sthe tip of the iceberg, is what I'm realizing. I'm realizing thattoday thanks to the way you're phrasing thingsbecause the bigger vessel is all in here. And as you said, how doyou put that in a book? DAVID GOGGINS: It's impossible. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Becauseit's highly individual. You do it your way. And you're saying,everyone needs to go figure out how todo it their way for them. DAVID GOGGINS: Yes. And the thing aboutbeing misunderstood, it's very frustrating, morethan I can even imagine. I can't even expresshow frustrating it is when the cussingand everything comes from a place of real. I can't explain whatI do without it. The passion comes out of me. It's almost like speaking intongues because when you put that much work-- andpeople go, oh yeah, there's been this basketballplayer, this football player, this-- dude. No. No. Everything, everything is work. Everything. And people don't believe it. So when I speak, themotherfucker and the fuck and the shit, that iswhat it took for me, what it takes for me, the anger,the passion, the jaw-dropping-- just it takes thatbecause I'm not that. This is how I look at it, man. What built this guy? Let's imagine beingin the coldest water you can possibly take. I always go back toHell Week with this. I hated that water. Hated it. You're sitting there lockedarms, and you're in the water all the time. And they're bringing youin and out of the water, in and out of the water. When you have thisdialogue in your head, and these people are judging meoff a freaking 1-minute video, and you're constantlyyour whole life, when you figured it outat 24, that I got to-- I just got to, justfucking got to, and this is just going to suck. Every day it's going to suck. And live like that to be better. And I put it this way. I'm in the water. The water is going over myhead, the Pacific Ocean. It's freezing. February. Cold as shit. Been through three Hell Weeks. For you to constantlywin, win, win, when this voice overhere, the real you, is saying get the fuck outof here, go, you're nobody. You've always been nobody. And it's true. People don't hear that. That's a true voice. That's a real reality ofDavid Goggins at 24 years old. It's not a false reality. And then you had to createanother voice over here that is saying, you're betterthan that other voice. And you're in thefreezing cold water that both voices don'twant to fucking be in. But you win. Then goes from thewater to the studying to the running tothe losing weight to how you eat to howyou function as a man. Every day of your life,you're winning these battles. And then I have normal peoplewho only have one voice. Never created the second voice. The winning voiceis the second voice. They have one voice. And that's just,I'm a piece of shit. And that's all they hear. And then they judgepeople like me who are out heretrying to be better. It's something thatI can never really-- it's a frustratingthing for me because I know the majority of people. I know what goes on in thebrain because I studied the mind more than almost-- more thanyou because I'm a practitioner. So for you to be a piece ofshit and come out of that, you don't just come out of it. You spend decades studyingyour mind and the human mind on how it functions in goodenvironments, bad environments, stressful environments,patient environments. You study it all becauseyou had to put all this together to create themind to become successful. So I had to-- it wasn't likeGod blessed me with this brain. I had to create a mind. And so in doingso, I figured out every piece of shithuman being in the world because that's what I wasgoing off of for myself. So I know why yougo on Instagram. I know why you-- becauseyou just have the time. You have the timebecause you don't want to put that timeinto bettering oneself. So I know why I'm misunderstood. I'm misunderstood by peoplewho have plenty of time on their hands to misunderstandme because they are exactly where I once was, which is alow-life, lazy piece of shit. And it's the harsh realityof people who troll you, who go after you. They have nothing betterto do with their lives. It's not some afterschool special. It's the truth. But I once was that way. I know where it all comes from. That's why it'sfrustrating to me now because I'm not sofrustrated at the fact that I'm being trolled. I'm frustrated bythe fact that you don't have thecourage, the courage to try to be somebodybetter than what you're not. And that's the frustrating part. ANDREW HUBERMAN:It's interesting because earlier, we weretalking about relationships. And you said, ina very candid way, and I really appreciateyou sharing that, that you make surethat the people close to you, your family,has everything they need and that they alsounderstand that you're going to take what you need tocontinue to build you period. DAVID GOGGINS: Period. ANDREW HUBERMAN:In some ways, it seems you've also included thegeneral public in that family. You're saying, listen, I'mgoing to give you what you need. I'm going to give you asmuch of myself as I can, except I'm going tostop right at the line that if I were tocross it is going to prevent me fromcontinuing to build myself. And by the way,this relationship only exists because Idon't cross that line. And I think as much as thereare detractors out there or people that try-- I mean, whatever they're doingis pretty feeble, in my mind. I mean, it's like capgun fire, it that. DAVID GOGGINS: Very feeble. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So many of us,men and women, old and young, hear something and feelsomething in your message. Like, yeah, itseems kind of crazy. Gosh. Doesn't he ever just relax? What about his sleep? Look at his feet. He's going to-- he'sgoing to injure himself. Listen, I'll be very direct. I got friends who were in theTeams who just go, what's he going to do when he can't run? And I know the answeris keep running. DAVID GOGGINS: That's right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Butit's more comfortable for people, evenhigh achievers-- DAVID GOGGINS: Especiallyhigh achievers. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --tobelieve that if you took one thing away, thatit would all go away. It's absolutely clear that'snot the case with you. I'm 100% convinced. I just know that becausewe're talking about this. DAVID GOGGINS: Do youknow how many times I haven't been able to run? Two heart surgeries. Multiple knee surgeries. And after every kneesurgery, they said, you're not going to run again. And I'm fine with that. There's no running up here, bro. None. This was what it was all about. That's what they lost. What if you can't run? Give a fuck. It was never about running. Why do you think I run? It's the worst thing. I hate doing itmore than anything. Hence the willpower. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. Your anteriormid-cingulate cortex DAVID GOGGINS:Hence the willpower. ANDREW HUBERMAN:--would start to regress if you loved running. DAVID GOGGINS: Think about it. Every day, I wake up. I don't just runa mile, two miles. It's the one thing Ihate the most to do. And I do it like I love it. 250, 260, 300-mileruns at one time. No sleep. And every step, when I getto the-- think about this. I get to the fucking startline cussing at Jennifer. Why the fuck am I here? I hate this shit. After 70-some hours ofrunning, every fucking question I ever had is answered. Every question Ihad is answered. I capped success. People go, what do youmean, you capped success? For me to be who I am-- so when I go smokejump, I smokejump three to four months out of the year, sometimes five. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Couldyou, just for those that aren't educatedabout-- just give us a brief descriptionof what smokejumping entails. DAVID GOGGINS: So basically,you jump into fires. Not into them, but you jump byfires that people can't get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So outof planes and helicopters. DAVID GOGGINS:Right, out of planes. I parachute. It's all parachuting. So you parachuteout of airplanes. And then you fight the fire, youand sometimes four other guys or maybe eight otherguys, guys and gals. And you're puttingthis fire out. So I lose millions of dollarsevery summer to do this. It blows people's minds. Why the hell are you doing this? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Andyou're breathing soot. DAVID GOGGINS: I'mbreathing soot. Knees are jacked up. Hitting the ground. Hurting. Whatever. Talking to normal people,they'll never get it, so I don't evenexplain it to them. But this is why-- this iswhy I call it capped success. I'm talking financial success. For me to continue having thatwillpower, the second I just become a speakingmonkey and travel around and speaking gigs 12months out of the year, put camps on, do this, put onlectures, get supplement lines and do this and writemore books and shit, I've ruined the exact thingI worked on my entire life. And while I didn'tknow it until the day, but somethingalways told me, this is a very, very, veryperishable skill, this willpower that you have, because I do havea willpower that I have never seen in anybody in my life. It is a haunting forcethat just keeps me going. And I know thatthat is my strength. If you have that-- so that'sworth every dime I've ever made in my life is the factI can look a man in the eye finally and have areal conversation without going likethis because I'm lying, or I'm a piece of shit. Or I know-- youknow how a person-- and so many people do this shit. They're talking to youon who they want to be. They're lying to you. And they walk away-- I've done it so many times. You walk away like, god, man. If I could justtell them the truth. Why the hell can't Ijust tell him the truth? Know how good itfeels for me now to look at you inyour eye and every man I see because womenwon't get this. Women will not get this. Man to man, thatman shit, when you look another manin the eye, and you know that everything you'refucking saying is real, and it comes from a realworking place, something that you earned, it's thebest feeling in the world. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You cansay that actually happened. Like, I know with certainty whatI'm saying actually happened. DAVID GOGGINS:Actually happened. Who I am and whoI say I am, I am. No more lies. No more skirting the truth. No more bullshit. And that is worth every dimeI've ever made in my life. And I swear to God on that. Every dime I've ever made inmy life, building who I built, so I capped successbecause I know that if I ever go 12months out of the year and don't put several--every day, I'm going at it. But several monthsout of the year, I go right back toground zero, which means I'm just fucking David Goggins. No Goggins. No carry boats,fucking logs bullshit. It's just pick up thatfucking Pulaski and dig. Hey, get that fucking pump. Walk down a mile. Put it in the fucking water. Mosquitoes beating--you're just David Goggins. You're nobody becausethat's where my growth is. That's where mywillpower comes from. And that's where it stays. That's why when I talk toyou now-- and can't nobody talk like this, dude. People don't talk withthis kind of passion because it ain't there. It ain't there. They're regurgitating someshit from 30 fucking years ago. I'm regurgitatingshit from an hour ago. Hour ago. Come on, man. It's just be real. And I can't be onthese podcasts. I can't talk to anybodywithout being real. I'll go away. I'll just go awaybecause I can't give you what I want to give you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yousaid perishable skill. I think that'sanother set of words I want to highlight becauseskill implies behavior. And when we were justtalking a second ago about the deep, true bedrocksense of confidence that comes from lookingsomeone in the eye and telling somebodysomething that you absolutely know it's truebecause it happened, you're talking about actions. Not talking about perceptions. You're not talking aboutwhat you believe happened. You know it happened. And there's something reallyconcrete about actions. I mean, that's what'sso interesting is we're talking about the mind. But actions are themanifestation of the mind. And the stuff that just staysin here, people die with that. It doesn't go anywhere. Long ago, somebody said-- I forget what the context was. It was a neuroscientist. He said, most emotions,they're just emotions. They're just in there. You don't have to doanything with them. And I think certain emotionsyou want to do something with. But I think people forget this. They feel miserable,like they're going to dissolve into apuddle of their own tears. No one ever diedfrom an emotion. But they feel-- they overwhelmus as if it's a tidal wave. It's going to pull usunder and drown us. It's so interesting to mebecause I think what people-- listen, you have agravitational pull. People can feel the energy. I think, yes, you'reeither completely badly or partially understood. There's only oneguy on the planet that truly understands you. I think there's onewoman, Jennifer, who probably understands youas much as anyone's going to. And then the rest of usare kind of grasping, trying to figure it out. But you're saying, go inward. So first, go inward. And then it's actions. Inward and actions. Now, the inwardpiece is something I'd like to just spend a littlebit of time on because there are a couple of charactersfrom history, people that were in concentration camps. Nelson Mandela. I mean, I'm not sure hehad Instagram in there. I'm pretty sure he didn't. And I don't think therewas anyone coaching him on, hey, you're goingto get out someday. And actually, you're goingto lead an entire country. I'm pretty sure that'snot how it worked. He had to find it here. He had to find itbetween his ears. And there are other examples. But that's an important one. So the process of goinginward, does it, for you-- and here, I willask for suggestions because I think people want-- there are those of us whowant to build this skill. Wall yourself off. Phone off for big portionsof the day, perhaps. Texting off. The requests, thethis, the that. Anyone that knows youknows that-- we've communicated a fewtexts, but most of it comes through a filter. She's great. She knows you. And she knows how toprotect your time. DAVID GOGGINS: And thathurts people's feelings. People get mad about that. ANDREW HUBERMAN:Hey, God bless-- God bless you, Jennifer. Cutting oneself off,when you're in there, you say it's just you. And the voices that comeup are not pleasant. And then at some point,it converts to action. OK. What is the processof picking the action? That's the piece thatI feel like there's, like, a bridge to build here,if you can, if you would. DAVID GOGGINS: So the actionbeing, like, what's next? ANDREW HUBERMAN:Yeah, so when you go to sleep at night,when that happens, you know what you'regoing to do the next day? It's pre-planned? DAVID GOGGINS: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. DAVID GOGGINS: Yes. It's always the same thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You'renot building it on the fly. DAVID GOGGINS: No. Nothing's on the fly. So how it worksinternally for me is I'll put it exactly how it is. I'm an artist. And every day, I'mpainting Mona Lisa. Every day. And but it's a different one. It's not the same painting. So every day I wake up, eventhough I'll do the same thing, it takes a differentway to get there. So every day, in my mind,I'm going through my mind. I'm just like-- and a goodpainter will not just paint. He needs to create. And you can't create withphones and everything going around you. So you got toblock yourself off. You only do twopodcasts in a year. You block yourself off. And you're paintingthis thing inside. And you're going throughall these different colors of paint and everything else. And you can only figureout the right painting if you spend the correctamount of time in your brain. So every singleday, I'm literally going through my mind,and I'm painting. I'm creating this masterpiece. And the masterpieceis always myself. And but to do that, youcannot have any distractions because if you're talking to anartist and he's trying to think about the nextpainting, he can't. It's impossible tolisten to you and listen to what your mind and bodyare telling you we must do. Because peopledon't do enough of. They don't do any of it. They don't have passion. They lack passion,drive, determination because you haven'tspent time with yourself. Your mind will tellyou what is next. But you haven'tspent the time to go, all right, let mejust figure this out. You're looking for let me Googlethis, and let me Google that, and let me-- you're notgoing to find it there because there's billionsof people in this world. And they're all supposedto be individuals. But we have a pack mentality. That's why you'reso fucking lost. Why am I so unique? I'm being exactly what thefuck I was supposed to be. I ain't follow shit. And when I did follow shit,I was like everybody else. The second I said, OK, man, hangon, dude, you don't like this, you don't like this, youdon't like this, who are you, David Goggins? Who are you supposed to be? Miraculously, allthese things just-- I couldn't even-- the list ofshit I had to do, just, wham. It's like, fuck. OK. Wow. Once you sit down withyourself and say, OK, I don't want to be likeMichael Jordan or Jim Brown-- they're both bornon my birthday. So I looked at their birthday. I said, oh, maybe Ican be one of the-- I can't. I'm going to be Davidfucking Goggins. And that looks like this. It just came. Everything flooded. So every single dayof my life, there's a different thing thatcomes up that I have to do. But no one knows what to dobecause everybody else is following steps. Like the Republicanand Democratic parties. I'm not political-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Neither am I. DAVID GOGGINS: --atall for this reason. Republicans are goingto vote Republican. Democrats are goingto vote Democrat. You're not even a humanfucking being, bro. No way all you fuckers agreewith all the same fucking shit. And I know I don't. So once you figure outyourself and who you are, all the answers come. So every night, a differentpainting is being painted. And it's a beautifulpainting for myself. I'm like, OK. That's it. It may look the sameto most motherfuckers. But the end result isvery fucking different. That's why my-- if you lookat what I've done in 49 years, it's more than most peoplewill ever do in their life because they werea race car driver. And that's what they did. They drove a fucking car. It's great. I was all kind of shitbecause that's exactly what the painting was saying to do. It's what the mindwas saying to do. Wasn't saying just drive a car,so then that race car driver didn't know what the fuck to do. He retires from being a racecar driver, and they're lost. People go, how are you still-- I don't get it. Dude, you're nevergoing to fill your list. But you never found yourlist because it never was presented in front ofyou because your head was cluttered with shit becauseyou never just stopped for lots of minutes, lotsof years, and just said, all right, it's me and you. Let it go. And it just-- bam. It's right there. It's right there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'mnot a psychologist, as I mentioned before. But I'm going to venturea hypothesis here. I think that you've mastered theprocess of internal dialogue. But when I say dialogue, Ithink most people think, oh, the inner voice, the chatter. But that's just onehalf of a dialogue. A dialogue is a two-way street. So I completely agree becauseI know from experience that when we go inward,oftentimes, we hear things, if we're really honest withourselves, it's like, oh no, I don't want tothink about that. No. And then we startlooking outward. Or we start trying to shiftour attention or distract. And there are amillion reasons that are handed to us, excuses, andseemingly good justifications to be able to do that. But dialogue isa two-way street. And it hit mewhile you were just saying what youwere saying, I was paying very close attention. And I realized David Gogginsis talking about the voice that comes up, including theterrible stuff that no one wants to hear about themselvesfrom themselves. But then he's also gotthe dialogue down where he knows the counter voice. He goes, yeah, you're right. And so I'm going to do this. Or maybe no, remember this. You're in a dialogue, atwo-way dialogue in there, not a one-way chatter dialogue. There are books writtenby famous psychologists about chatter, trying toshift your internal narrative. You're like, bringthe internal-- the internal narrative, that'swhat going inward is about. But it's not one voice. Again, there's a hypothesis. And I'm not claimingto be all-knowing. Lord knows I'm not all-knowing. But you've masteredthe dialogue. And if there are three voices,strong, medium, and weak, in there, you're like,let's all come to the table. So you've got a symphonyof voices in there that are all you, thatyou know to be you. And you know how to havethose convers-- you're not afraid to be inthose conversations. And then you know what theoutcome of that committee decision is, and you putit into real-world action. And the world onlysees the action. DAVID GOGGINS: That's it. ANDREW HUBERMAN:And only you can know your internal dialogue. And only I can knowmy internal dialogue. And the only way to,quote unquote, \"know it\" is to spend a hella lot of time there. DAVID GOGGINS: That's right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. DAVID GOGGINS: A lifetime. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. DAVID GOGGINS: A lifetime. Like, think about it. For me to be sittinghere in front of you, you're not going tocall 300-pound Ecolab guy to come sit here. You might. I don't know. Maybe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. DAVID GOGGINS: Probably not. Think about this. What we teach people iskind, kindness to yourself. Do you think if Itaught myself kindness-- and I agree with it. God, so many people-- so manypeople take me out of context, it's ridiculous. Take it however the fuckyou want to take it. When I was 300pounds, where do you think that conversationwould that got me if I spoke kindness to myself? I'll tell you where it gets me. Right back to 7-Eleven withanother box of mini chocolate donuts and achocolate milkshake. That's the one voice. That's the one voicethat most of us have that you're talking about. If you don't have a conversationin there, the other voice that you create that says,OK, how does this look? Looks very ugly. That kind conversation forme went away a long time ago, which is why the dialogueis now what you see. A lot of action. Because most people haveinaction because there's one person talking. And that one personis always leading you down the samepath, the path that makes you feel very comfortableand happy with yourself. The second you create theother voice, there's conflict. Just battles. Just wars. Just defeat. One thing I learned, andI taught myself this, and people go, I don'tunderstand what you're saying, I'm going to try tobreak it down real quick. I didn't teachmyself victory first. I taught myself failure. I taught myself how to fail. And people like,that's so depressing. Is it? When you're 300 pounds andyou can't read and write and you're fucked up,you know how many times you're going to fuckingfail on that process? So if you don't know how tofail, there is no victory. I never talked aboutwinning because I knew the path towinning was going to be years of failing first. So I taught myselfhow to fail properly. No one teaches youhow to fucking fail. But if you're going outfor insurmountable fucking odds that make absolutelyno fucking sense, a Black kid that can'tswim, 300 pounds-- going to be a Navy SEAL. OK. You better teach yourselfhow to fail first because if you sit infailure for too long, you will never come out of it. So the first partof my success was learning how to fail properly. And then eventually, I startedgetting a few victories. But that's whatpeople don't get. When you have buried yourselfin such a deep fucking hole, you better first talkabout the failures you're going to have first. And that's when thatother voice comes up. It tells you, we'vegot to do something. But it also tellsyou, boy, I'm not going to lie to you, Goggins. You're in for afucking climb, bro. You're going to getyour ass handed to you, made fun of, the outsidenoise, the inside noise. Both voices are goingto be fucking telling you to go fuck yourself. You are in for hell, bro. I am. So I better learn to fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN:So this is what you mean when you say thatwhatever anyone says, it's insignificant? DAVID GOGGINS:Insignificant as fuck. ANDREW HUBERMAN:It's the cap gun fire because it's just likeit-- because the voice in your own head is far worse. And I should say, sorry, oneof the voices in your head. I'm being very detailed,almost surgical about that because I thinkthis thing about inner dialogue we think is one voice. But you're making itclear it's many voices. DAVID GOGGINS: It is. And the thing about it is,you have to be really-- and sometimes all thevoices are telling you the wrong shit, man. But through years, years, not apodcast or listening to a book or reading a book,years of sacrifice, of suffering, of diligentpinpoint fucking work on what you wantto do for yourself, not like, oh, let mejust do a bunch of shit. Let me-- I want to bein every task possible. No. Pinpoint what I wantto do with my life. What happens is you haveall these voices that are telling youyou're fucked up, and this is going to be hard. But for some reason, you putso much practice into you that you can ignoreevery one of them that are telling you you're notgoing to fucking make it. And still be ableto fucking make it because you have putthe practice in that you know this is the process. It's such a daunting task thatall the voices are saying no. But you still havethe conviction that I know I can do this. And that's what it tookfor me to get here. 20, 30 years ago, I had this-- 35 or whatever it was,25 years ago, pipe dream. And ever since then, every voicewas like, you're a fucking nut. But when you put that practicein every day, you lace them up. And I mean, run. It's just a metaphor for life. When you lace themmotherfuckers up every day, pretty soon, you win. Pretty soon, you'll fucking win. If you have the courage andthe heart and the dedication and the mindset of everybodycan go fuck themselves, I know what I know. I've listened tomyself enough to know. I know what I know. None of you can hearwhat I'm hearing. And that's what peopledon't do enough of. They don't listento their journey. They listen toeverybody else's shit. Before you know it, I'm crazy. But if I'm so fucking crazy,why am I so successful? How that happen? But I'm so misguidedand fucked up. And don't listen to him. Why am I the only one todo a whole bunch of shit? Why am I a trailblazer? Why? How is that possible? How can you be fucked up andalso self-made at the same fucking-- no. No. Obviously, you're not lookingat the truth in front of you. The truth in frontof you is it sucks. It's painful. It's fucking mind-numbing. And that is the truth. And that's why alot of people don't like listening to me becausethis is what it takes, creating another voice andsometimes going at it alone. All the time going at italone because no one's going to believe in you. And that's that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: What I'mabout to say is not conjecture. And I can say thatwith confidence because I did afour-episode guest series with a brilliantpsychiatrist, a guy named Paul Conti. He's from Trenton. He's a Stanford,Harvard-trained guy. He's also got a lotof street in him. He's had his ownhardship, real hardship. He's brilliant. And he said somethingthat I'll never forget, which is, we think thatthe forebrain, the part of our brain that createsstrategy, et cetera, is the supercomputer. He said, no, no, no,no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. He's like, thesupercomputer of the brain is the unconscious mind. It's the part of our mind that'scontrolling most everything. And most people,unfortunately, don't do the work to understandhow their unconscious is controlling them. And that's a scarything, this idea, like your mind iscontrolling you. And I'm not going to getinto the free will debate. I believe in at least some will. I believe what you're describingand this internal dialogue, I think you have accessto your unconscious mind by listening to thedialogue, going inward. We know this is true in sleep,in dreams, in meditation, and just by shutting outeverything else, shutting out all the externalnoise, which is filled with things that pull us to it. Noise makes it sound bad, butit's the gravitational pull of all the things that allowus to distract ourselves without knowing. The ice cream. The have a cookie. The Merry Christmas. The unconsciousmind, this huge piece of the iceberg underneath thatPaul calls the supercomputer, he's saying that withknowledge as a neurobiologist, psychiatrist, psychologist,so he really knows, that's the piece that ifone does real introspection, he calls it the cupboards. You got to lookin the cupboards. And it's often really scarywhat you find in there. And most people arejust like, I don't even want to know thecupboards are there. But you're pulling allthe cupboard doors open. And then you're-- and you'reextremely deliberate with what gets put into action. You're not just going,oh, like, I'm pissed, so I'm going to act pissed. Or I'm tired, so I'mgoing to act tired. It's you're picking verycarefully what to do. And that's a process thatI'm guessing came to you. Does it come to youas a, OK, it makes sense why running makes sense. It makes sense whysmokejumping makes sense. So it seems like a hugeportion of your time is spent understanding yourselfand making sense to you. And so when peopledon't understand you, it's got to be extra frustratingbecause most people don't understand themselves. So then we're all runningaround going, you're this, and you're that becausemost people are just unwilling to look inward. And I'm includingmyself, by the way. I mean, I've done a fairamount of introspection. But I'm inspired today, thatword, inspired, but it's true, motivated to start going inwardfurther because it is scary. It's like, we don't knowwhat's in those cupboards, and it's terrifying, especiallybecause we don't know. DAVID GOGGINS: And those arethe first ones to open up. And like you talkedabout, you got to go through those cupboards. I do spring cleaningevery fucking day in those dark cupboards. Those dark cabinets are theones I start with first. That's the real me, man. That's the real me. That's why I'm not ashamed. I don't hide. I used to hide. I don't hide anymore. He's exactly right. I don't know all thefucking science behind shit. I know what I know. That's why I don't listento anybody anymore. I don't listen to shit. I think most people arefull of shit because I know. I know the deep, dark secretsof those fucking cupboards. It's ugly, man. And every day, I'mtalking to them. Every day, I'm cleaning them. I'm cleaning them,and I'm talking to the same demons that cameout of those fucking cupboards as I'm cleaning them. Sometimes they go rightback in them again. It's not easy. And this is whymost of us just-- why I am misunderstoodbecause what comes out of those cabinetsthat I'm cleaning, sometimes they see on Instagram. Sometimes they'llsee it in a podcast. Sometimes they seeit in this one. I turn people off. Open up your own cabinets. And then go talk about it. Let me see how pretty it looks. Let me see how pretty you sound. Let me see how puttogether your words are. I bet you a fuck or amotherfucker comes out because for you to goback in there again to clean the same fuckingcabinet that the demon came out of takes some big balls, bro. To do it every day of your life. To go back in there and springclean every day, not once a fucking year,once every decade. Every day you knowit gets dusty. And every day, you don'tstart with the victories. You don't go, oh, this is nice. Look at my-- look atmy I love me wall. Let me clean up. This is a little dusty. No. I go right for the things thatare going to keep me buried. And I go right there firstbecause if I don't clean those out first, theday doesn't start. So what are yousaying to me is truth. And like I told youmany times today, I can never figure out how toexplain this shit to people because I'm not neuro nothing. I'm just a guy that said, OK,we got to start in the dungeon. And we got to stay herefor the rest of our lives. For you to becomesuccessful, the dungeon is a place that has to be clean. And it's thescariest place to be. That's why I'mmisunderstood because I'm speaking from the dungeon. That's why I amsuccessful because I go there every damn day. And that is thetruth, what he says. It's the exact truth. Those cabinets arefucking dusty, dirty, and scary as shit. Broken glass, fuckingdark, spiders, cobwebs. But most of all,your biggest fears, the biggest things that putyou in a fucked up place you are today are in there. That's why we all liketo keep them shut. You like to lock them up. Act like they never happened. That's why you never grow. You never improve. You never havereal conversations like we're having right now. Never. Never. Oh no. No, no, no, no, no. Let's not-- no, no, no. Let's not go there. I talked to so manypeople who tell me that. Let's talk about this. Because they'll tell me, butthey can only say it once. And they'll say it in passing. They won't get deepin the weeds with it. Like, you can't just clean it. Motherfucker, you got tospit shine that motherfucker. You got to relive it,every fucking detail of it. You can't just be like, ohyeah, yeah, my dad beat me. And it is what it is. It ain't is what itis, motherfucker. It's killing you. It's taken over yourwhole fucking life. But that's the conversation. Yeah, my dad beat-- butI'm fine now, though. I'm good. OK. All right. No, you ain't. You ain't fine. You ain't fine. This is real talk. People don't have that. So your boy's right. 100% right. Scary as shit. It's scary as shit. But it makes you whoyou're supposed to be. And that's the test. We forget. We think we're supposed tobreathe air and have kids and pay the bills and shit. But what's this life about? That makes no sense. We're being tested, my friend. Tests come when youhave not studied. Tests come when you thinkthat you're in a great place. That's the test. The test is everyday of your life. And most of us failbecause we don't know why we're here becausewe don't go inward to say, oh. You gave me a lotof shit to fix, man. And this test sucks. But then you start. ANDREW HUBERMAN: David Goggins. I don't think Icould add to that. I know I can't. Thank you for sharingwhat you shared today. I mean, as much as yourprocess or anyone's process can't be completelyunderstood from the outside, you gave us a realwindow into this thing, this process that you-- as you said, God put it on you. I believe in God too. People can believewhat they want. But somehow, your life, God gaveyou these challenges early on. And then there was a pointwhere you went internal. And like you said,you developed a skill. But it's a perishable skill. And you clearlylive in the process of opening those cupboards,reopening those cupboards, trying to spit shinethose cupboards, understanding that they'renever, ever really done, but that you can gain groundon them, that you can win day after day after day. And you really shared alot of concrete things that I know peopleare going to be able to apply if they choose. And I agree with you. I think most peoplewill be like, whoa. That was a lot. It's heavy. I think I want to just kind ofbake myself in Netflix and Chex Mix instead. But there's also thereality that there are men and women, boys andgirls who hear that and go, OK, and start crackingthe cupboards open. And I just knowthat for myself, I'm extremely grateful thatyou're willing to put it all out there. You're so brutally honest,so brutally authentic. That word authenticitygets thrown around so much. And I can tell you that for meand for everybody else, that's really what resonates. So whether or not you wantto, whether or not it's the purpose behind it or not,you're lighting the path.
