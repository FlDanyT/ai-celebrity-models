      "transcript": "What are you announcing today? Well, in celebrating 25 years of uh incredible progress at the Gates Foundation, I'm committing that my money and the money in the foundation will all be spent over the next 20 years uh to the causes that we work on. global health being the biggest uh education being the second biggest uh and basically things that you know we treat lives as having uh equal value and I'm super excited that uh that'll be over 200 billion uh that we'll give away during that time period and that we'll be able to save uh tens of millions of lives and you're not going to miss it. No, I won't. you know, uh I hope I'm still alive when uh we finish the 20 years, but I'll save a little bit uh to to be able to buy hamburgers as much as I need. Has any organization in the history of humanity ever given anywhere near $300 billion away? No. This will be uh for a foundation uh a a large amount of resource definitely more than than ever before, you could say. So, why are you doing it now? Well, I think it's important to double down on the great success we've had. Uh, you know, I didn't know uh when we got started how much progress we'd make. Um, I saw the tragedy of over 10 million children dying every year. Uh, I saw that the vaccines that could save those lives were being given to rich kids who were not at risk. and not to the kids in other countries. And so, uh, we've been able, uh, to make sure that vaccines that stop you dying of diarrhea or pneumonia, uh, and other diseases are now getting out, uh, to almost all of those kids. And that's why we've gone from 10 million children dying every year to under five million children dying every year. And um you know we we can do more. But why double down now? I know you say you're optimistic about the future, but one could look at this change in your approach and think, is he worried? Is he panicked? Well, whenever you create a foundation, you can decide that it should last forever. Um but then saying, okay, who's in charge? uh you know will it stay true to the things I wanted to focus on uh by deciding to spend all this money in the next 20 years uh we can get a lot more done and after that you know there'll be other very wealthy people who can understand what the problems are what's still left over uh so we're giving a lot of certainty and and uh doubling down uh because of the success you know in a way it's wild that somebody can have as much money as as I do. It is wild. Uh and you know, so I'm lucky to say, okay, you know, let's make sure those uh who are the poorest are the most in need. You know, kind of an equity valuedriven approach that I got from my parents. Uh that that's I'll be able to watch over uh making sure that money is very well spent. So, I guess what I was driving at is there's no particular worry or fear or concern of yours right now that's leading to this decision. Well, I'm sad that 5 million children die every year. I'm sad that uh some of the the causes like helping to buy vaccines for children. Now, it looks like we'll be able to raise less money uh now uh than we did in the past because the US uh at least is tentatively not supporting uh buying those vaccines and uh other countries in Europe that have always been substantially more generous uh are also cutting back as they have budget tightness. I will say um despite the challenges we have right now which are huge and surprising, I'm very optimistic about the progress we can make over the next 20 years. The next five there will be setbacks because of these these uh uh cutbacks, but you know, we'll get and so the number five million might go up for a bit uh which shouldn't happen. It's terrible. Uh but over time we'll get that number down even below uh 3 million. But I heard something in the middle of that answer which it sounds like in part you're doing this because you're looking at the world and you're looking at this country and they're doing less. So the Gates Foundation and other foundations need to do more. Well, you always want more money going into these things where you're saving lives for a few thousand dollars. I mean, if people could actually visit and go to a malaria ward and see those children, they would buy bed nets. If you saw a hospital like one in a part of Mosamb beek called Gaza, you know, the money that stopped mothers from giving uh HIV to babies was cut off uh because of some confusion there. And you know, that's just an incredible tragedy. Uh so I'd be doing this even if others were being generous. You know, I I want to make sure uh the money is spent as soon as possible. I view these things as urgent. In parallel with that, I'll always be an advocate uh that governments should uh you know, we never ask for more than 1% uh to go to helping uh the poorest. Um, and you know, I I think you know, cutting when you're well below that 1%, cutting that I I think is, you know, doesn't reflect the values I think we should uh stand for. So, you think America doesn't currently reflect the values it should be standing for? No, I think the US uh shouldn't be cutting the money for vaccines or HIV medicines. And I'll be an an advocate uh that uh you know what was done uh now over 20 years ago when President Bush created a lot of these programs uh for HIV, malaria and some other things uh that you know that that should be maintained. What's it been like working with the Trump administration? I know you recently had dinner with the president. Did anything come out of that? Yeah. So I talked to him about uh work on HIV and the great innovations and uh encouraged him the same way he had helped the COVID vaccine get done quickly. I said, \"Hey, let's work together to get uh what's called an HIV cure uh done sooner. I talked about polio. We're close uh that uh we we stay committed uh we could get that done in the next four or five years.\" So uh you know it's a great discussion. Since then some of the programs uh have been cut off and I you know I'm hoping both with the president or the congress uh to get them to restore uh some of that those aid activities. If they don't is the Gates Foundation large enough to take the place of what the government had been doing? Not no the the government money here is is uh over four times even now at this high level where we're spending down over the 20 years the the government the US government's very bigger than one individual. So their money for global health uh was four times uh what what the Gates Foundation So if this money goes away and you were talking about millions of lives saved, can you put a number on the lives potentially lost or? Yeah, absolutely. So we should be going from 5 million children dying a year over the next five years to four million. And now with these cuts, if they're if they're not reversed, we'll go to over 6 million dying. So instead of going down, we'll go back up. Wow. Um so it's a difference of 2 million lives. Absolutely. These vaccines, the HIV medicines, preventing mothers from infecting their babies, uh the impact of this money is been miraculous. And the good news of going from the 10 million to 5 million, it's, you know, it's too bad people don't realize that uh in the US, their government's generosity. In Europe, their government's generosity uh partnering with us and others has been why we've had a greater reduction in childhood death than ever in history of the world was this magic time period. So, why don't you think more people know this and are not right now calling their congressperson, writing letters to the White House and saying, \"Please help.\" Well, over time, I think they will. I mean, we have partners like Rotary who help with polio eradication. Uh I don't think they'll uh stand still while that money and those people have have been let go. You know, we want to not let polio spread back to where it's paralyzing hundreds of thousands of children a year and that's, you know, hangs in the balance. So I a lot of it is that you don't see it. You know if you go visit then you can't turn away from it. Uh you you will be drawn into the helping these children and as you make these children healthier uh then they can be educated. They can uplift their economies. you know, the recipients like Indonesian, Vietnam who got a lot of this global health money are now have graduated and they fund it entirely with their own resources and so we get to focus in on the countries that are in the most need and help them lift themselves up. I I want to ask about focus, where to put one's attention because people hearing you talk right now, it's not that they want millions of children overseas to die of preventable illnesses. They don't no one no one's rooting for that. But at the same time, they're thinking the money that we have to give, the money that Bill Gates has to give, why not spend it here in America where we have plenty of problems of our own. So the the plea here would be to say that for 1% of the budget, we're not touching the 99%. for 1% if you can save lives for a thousand times less than we save lives here and if that creates stability in those countries so they're thriving countries that'll participate in the global economy and we don't have to intervene with our military or anything and the strategic relationship with them where they see that we've helped them uh advance uh and that that money is why you'll be able to see a future pandemic early and stop it from spreading like co did all the way to the United States. So there's a lot of benefits uh that come from what is a quite in the scope of the US government a very modest amount of money. And yet here we are with reports out there that the Trump administration may by executive order make it illegal for charities like yours to send money overseas and still get a tax benefit. If that were to come to pass, well just first off, what's your reaction to that possibility? Yeah, I hope they don't do that. Um, I think that, you know, if you uh are successful and you care about children dying, you you should be able to uh uh give uh you know, all of these programs, buying vaccines, buying HIV medicines so that mothers don't infect children, buying bed nets, these are things that the US government was giving more than I am. uh to these things. Now, that is up for question. Uh but I'd be surprised if they actually said the freedom to help those children is taken away. Okay. You are turning 70 this year. Microsoft is turning 50. The foundation is turning 25. A lot going on. Uh what are you doing to celebrate? Um, you know, I'm stunned that, you know, I'm 70. Uh, because when I was young, I, you know, I thought, hey, those old people don't, uh, they're not very up to-date on, you know, what's changing, what's important, and, you know, so here I am. Uh obviously now rather than you know write code myself or do it hands-on I'm supporting great young people you know scientists who are coming up with new vaccines like we're funding a TB vaccine and an HIV vaccine and we're coming up with new uh seeds that allow farmers to be more productive even if the weather's uh getting more difficult for them. So it's it's equally fun uh to be supporting you know very young innovative people and and heroes who are out in the field delivering these innovations. But the question was about celebration. Oh okay. Uh, you know, I I still like to work hard, but uh you know, when my birthday comes in late October, I'll you know, gather hundreds of my friends and, you know, maybe they'll roast me or we'll just uh you know, stay up late. Um, no, it's it's it's incredible that uh you know, I'm I'm very lucky to have these resources. I love doing the work. Um, yeah, you know, I get to travel and see the impact. Um, and I'm not working. In my 20s, all I did was work. Uh, those Microsoft days were very intense. Now I'm, you know, more normal. I I do take time off. I play tennis. I play pickleball. I get to read and um, you know, so I'm I'm not all all work. But while you are retirement age and you take a little more time for fun, you're definitely not retired. No, I'm I work full-time. you know, I go to Africa and India and, you know, go to the labs where these scientists are doing the work. I like to really understand, okay, what's going well, what's not going well. Um, what what was it like in the note accompanying this announcement today, you write that you're beginning the last chapter of your career, just typing those words, last chapter. What's that feel like? Well, I wish I had, you know, even more time and, you know, I hope I'm lucky enough that during the 20 years that we spend uh all of these resources that I'll be able to both help guide it somewhat and, you know, see the work uh and make sure that others, you know, are going to step in to pick up where whatever doesn't get done uh during these next 20 years. Uh no, I I don't feel like a 70-year-old. that always kind of is like wow how did that happen? Uh but you know I have to say okay this this is uh you know the last part of my life and I'm a steward of of these resources I should make sure that it's well spent. you know, Warren Buffett's generosity, that's always I've felt a huge responsibility to make sure his generosity is uh highly impactful and and now uh you know this is the last stage of all that. I um I once sat down with Dolly Parton in an interview like this and I asked her what does she hope the world says about her 100 years from now and she said I hope they say doesn't she look good for her age. But it does raise the question, Bill. What do you hope the world says about you 100 years from now? Well, I have no interest, you know, in that. You know, if I cared about that, maybe I'd make the foundation a a foundation that lasts forever. And I, you know, other people choose to do that. That's fine. I don't think that's the way to have the most impact. Most of the things I work on will no longer be problems. you know, TB should be eradicated, measel should be eradicated, malaria. And so, you know, people might be puzzled. What were these things? Uh, you know, just like smallox uh has been eradicated. Nobody has to worry about that. Now, what an amazing thing to say. The problems that you're working on now and taking on in the next 20 years, you think a hundred years from now will feel like distant memories. Yeah. I think we'll treat all children's lives as having value uh because the world will be rich enough and the innovative tools that let you do that will be so strong. Uh you know that the childhood death number you know should be very small and not different between different countries. You know there's another big milestone in the year ahead just about a year. The 250th anniversary of the birth of America the Declaration of Independence. You're born here. You built your company here. As Barack Obama used to say, only in America is your story even possible. Do you think America 250 years in? Or better question, do you think the world is better off today because of America and its people than it otherwise would be? Well, certainly the fact that both people born here and people who come here are working on the latest medical understanding and willing to share that knowledge including some funding uh for it. Uh the US has been fantastic. you know, the PEPAR program uh that goes back to uh President Bush that was so generous, you know, literally saved millions of lives. Uh you know, the US has a lot to be proud of. It's a a model for research. It's a model for the amount of philanthropic giving people do where they can pick, you know, a huge range of causes from art to cancer to uh education. Yeah. And do great work. No, this this country's made gigantic contributions. And yet, and I've covered this when I talk to young people, poll after poll shows that most young people don't believe or at least don't have a positive view of capitalism. And many of them don't have a positive view of America. What are they missing? I I'm I think you're you must be misreading those numbers somewhat. Definitely not misleading the capitalism number. uh only 40% of people under the age of 29 young people have a positive view of capitalism according to Gallup. Well, I wonder what you know they're they're thinking is the alternative to that. I mean certainly, you know, we've seen where you have East East East Germany versus Western Germany, you have North Korea versus South Korea, you have societies that are culturally identical at the start and one runs a more capitalistic system. The other you see the outcomes in terms of education, life expectancy, freedom. Uh now capitalism covers such a range of things. you know, should taxes on rich people be higher? That's within capitalism. Sure. Uh, you know, should companies be held to a higher standard? That's within it. But this is the system that organizes human activity that led to, you know, we people now live over twice as long as they did 100 years ago. Uh, you know, people are largely literate whereas if you go back 100 years ago, the majority were not. So this system, it's very imperfect, but the arc of time is that it's worked very well. Yeah. I mean, I think when you ask a young person, what do you think of capitalism, they're thinking, how's their life going, and how do they think their future is going to go? And it it does seem that from your generation to a younger generation, even younger than me, a lot of pessimism has snuck in. And that's very complicated because, you know, what are they comparing to? they wouldn't want to have been born 50 years ago. Uh honestly, if they think so, they're, you know, that's a one of those factual uh difficulty problems. Uh you know, we are far far better off today. Um, but this is fascinating because 50 years ago they would have said, uh, I could I could have a high school degree, still have a job where I can save a little money, take a vacation, own a car, own a home, retire with dignity, and hope my children are better off and expect that my children will be better off than me. People today don't even want to have kids in larger numbers than we've seen before. Um, they Well, the US birth rate is down somewhat. all rich countries uh over time you actually have have some reduction there. This is the best time to be alive. You know, if you get cancer today, it's better than 50 years ago. If you're uh a woman, if you're a gay person, if you want to learn a variety of things, uh yes, there are problems. Um we need to solve Alzheimer's. We need to get rid of polio. uh but you know now we have the tools that you know it's within our reach to make those advances. Let's go back to the three big goals for the future of the Gates Foundation. One being eliminating childhood deaths, infant deaths, and deaths of mothers in in childirth, the elimination of infectious disease. Before I get to the third, which is about prosperity, and I think it's a longer conversation, what are you most excited about technologically that's going to help you accomplish those those goals? Well, the uh you know, malaria is this terrible disease that was in America but uh got eradicated. Um you know, we have tools now that give us a chance to completely get rid of that. Uh malnutrition is a terrible thing. You know, most kids in Africa don't ever develop their brain or their body because their diet isn't quite right. And that's just a huge tragedy. Um HIV, you know, we have 40 million people in the world living with HIV. And uh they don't live their full lifespan even if they're taking their medicine. Uh and so we need a tool that actually does a real HIV cure. You know, in every one of those areas, the Gates Foundation is funding brilliant scientists. Uh we have trials underway. And so even in this 20 years, I'd expect uh to to have advanced each of those problems. On that third area, putting people on a path to prosperity, education is a big part of it. You write about that. AI is a part of education. I've asked the heads of some of the major AI companies the following question and I'll ask you. What do you think a seven-year-old, a first grader needs to know today to be ready for the world that AI is creating? Well, in a certain sense, it's going to be so novel that none of us are ready for it. But some of the aspects of it are incredibly positive. I mean, we're already creating these AI tutors, you know. So, I went to New Jersey to see how a form of AI called Khan Amigo from Khan Academy was being used by the math teachers there. And it was great to see the kid who was way behind, it was helping him. The kid who was way ahead, it was helping him. Uh, the promise in areas like health and education of AI improving the world is phenomenal. Um, you know, kids will choose what they're interested in. They don't all have to be AI scientists. That we only need a small portion uh to go and do that. But for any young person now, AI can uh foster their curiosity, help them learn new things. So, it's a very empowering tool. It is an empowering tool. But what I'm driving at is if AI can do most everything the human brain can do in the near future, what do we need to prepare the human brain for? What do we get up in the morning and contribute to the world if AI can do everything? Well, that's, you know, that's called the embarrassment of riches problem that, you know, you won't have to work the long hours that you work today. You won't uh have a shortage of doctors and huge waiting lists. uh you know if a kid in the inner city feels like God math's not for me I'm confused you know they'll be able to seek encouragement and get things that motivate them uh to learn those things and so it's true that if you solve so many of society's problems society will get to decide how do you spend time and how quickly that comes um you'd get pretty broad disagreement but in general that's where we're headed. Uh and so that you know we'll we'll have more freedom. It's a lot better than than you know things going backwards where we don't particularly if you look at place like Africa you know millions die because there's not enough doctors and we'll use AI to provide medical advice uh that will will eliminate that tragedy. So what do you teach a first grader to be ready for the world ahead? I don't think you would change what you're doing today. You know, if they they encourage them in the subjects they like, over the next few years, the AI tutors will come in and and help teachers, help them uh engage their students and motivate their students, but it's not like there's some new curriculum that we need to adopt. All right. That's interesting. You mentioned Alzheimer's. Your father died with Alzheimer's. My grandfather died with a a rarer similar disorder called super nuclear palsy. And every day I think about it. I'm sure you think about it, too. Where are we with understanding the brain and how to prevent illnesses like this? Well, there's a lot of resources being put into Alzheimer's research. Um, I've funded some things. Can I ask you before you get in, do you worry, because I I worry with my grandfather. Do you worry about the path your father went down and whether these next 20 years you could follow? Well, certainly, you know, once you get to your 80s and 90s, your risk of all kinds of diseases is very high, you know, uh and we'll all, you know, eventually succumb to these things. I'm not somebody who's I'm not putting my money into my longevity or the medical risks that that I have. Yeah. you know, most of my money goes um for, you know, deaths that are are very cheap to avoid. I did pick Alzheimer's because I met some of the researchers there and yeah, we now have a blood test where you can see what your amaloid levels are. Um there's a lot of work going on with drugs. People like Eli Lily have trials out that maybe if you're accumulating amaloid, you can use an antibbody drug uh to get rid of that and prevent or reduce the chance of getting Alzheimer's. So, I'd say this field over the next 10 years will be very different. Uh you know, that's why I I fund some of that work. I stay up to date on it. We're okay. Gathering data about all the people who have Alzheimer's so scientists can try out different ideas. They all want me to ask you about measles. I I find measles to be something hard to keep covering because the avail the knowledge is available if people want to utilize it. Get a vaccine, your risk goes way down. People don't seem to want to utilize it. And you and I having a conversation about it or scolding somebody or telling me what telling them what they need to do. A conversation about it doesn't seem to help. In fact, on some level seems to to hurt. People are offended to be told what to do. Well, the number of measles deaths in the US won't be large. It'll be a lot larger than it should be because of the uh skepticism from people in positions of leadership about the vaccine. It'll cause more deaths outside the United States because whenever and there, you know, it's over 300,000 deaths a year. Um and so, you know, that that to me is is deeply unfortunate. uh you know I've seen uh children who have measles who are dying of measles. It's horrific. Uh you know the US is lucky uh that we don't have much of that. We had a a a thing in Samoa where they stopped using the vaccine and uh pretty quickly they had a lot of deaths uh from measles because of that. So, um, you know, it's a medical miracle and, uh, I wish we were using any, uh, influence, uh, to encourage people to vaccinate. But, but it seems like the more you push vaccines, the more some people are resistant to the push. That's the trap that I struggle to get out of. I don't know how anyone does. Well, you know, we're working to take vaccines and instead having a needle, uh, it's just a little patch you put on your arm. Uh, you know, we don't know that might help improve the uptake. We're combining a lot of the vaccines together so that there's not as many, uh, shots involved. Um, you know, we've shown that the uh HPV vaccine uh in a lot of countries they've taken our data and they they see you only have to get it once uh to be fully protected. So that's saving a lot of money and helping us cover a lot more girls to prevent cervical cancer. So you know the vaccine story, we will have a TB vaccine, we'll have an HIV vaccine. Uh those are super important tools for the future of our health. Um you mentioned Andrew Carnegie in the beginning of your essay, your note today, and Andrew Carnegie said in his memoirs that he doesn't believe in a personal God that cares about the affairs of man, but he does believe in a God. Is that where you are on the subject? Yeah, I don't think I I have definitive knowledge in this area. U but you seem excited about what what you might learn in the next 20 years about this subject. But I think the basic idea of the golden rule that you know we should help other humans uh you know that pervades all religions uh and you know my parents inculcated that in me and uh you know so that's guides the work I do. But you said you're more or less an atheist. I don't have a particular knowledge of uh you know what rituals God wants us to engage in but my values are very similar to people who are deeply religious. Interesting. Maybe God will hold a press conference one of these days. Help us out. Yeah, he could clear up a lot in 15"

accomplished many Feats in his life from co-founding Microsoft and becoming a billionaire in his 30s to creating a nonprofit Foundation that has given away nearly 80 million in Grants but before all of that he was just a kid growing up in Washington where his parents and teachers thought he was different and so did he he's written about it in his newly released autobiography the first of three parts and discussed it with ar Lee Cowen my social skills were very slow to develop uh so except for a few boys similar to me I didn't have that many friends he's not saying that for sympathy he's just being analytical it's the way his mind works and it's the way the first of his three-part autobiography is written here is the the setup the source code that uh you know almost certainly was going to lead to some uh pretty amazing impact later in the show Bill Gates on how he got so good at business where do you think your business accur came from well I've always had kind of this overs simplistic view that if you're good at math then a lot of things you should also be able to figure those things out you know so in business you have your income and your costs and you subtract those and you know try to get a good number and the software business you know was a great business because if you sell a lot of copies even at a very low cost you can have income that's not connected to your your costs and I was afraid you know many of the the companies I admired like Wayne computer had just gone out of business then we visit the Museum of Modern Art in New York City where Contemporary Art Superstar Christian marklay has created a 24-hour film comprised of clips from Cinema and television history the time shown in the film and television scenes within marclay's creation coincides with the actual time in real life life it's been more than a decade since the film was last in New York but as Mar clay told our Connor knon he wants viewers to be hyper aware of the time they're spending watching a clock the clock runs on a continuous loop sync to the precise time of day when the kids in The Breakfast Club are whistling at 11:31 a.m. it's 11:31 in real life lime jelly an hour later Rainman announces PA 1231 minute by minute the footage functions as an actual clock that's all coming up right here on here comes the sun Bill Gates might have stepped down as Microsoft CEO a quarter century ago but he's still changing the world with his philanthropic work especially on global health issues he's a man who's constantly in the spotlight but as Lee Cowen found out he's also a man who will always find time for his favorite burger Mr Gates I'm Dr l Hof stutter we've actually met before Bill Gates may not strike you as an actor certainly not a comedic one I mean ever since I was a little kid I've looked up to you like like a hero but he can be a funny guy would you like a tissue how about a hug how how about a tissue even when he was arrested at the age of 21 his smile makes you think there was a lot more going on in that head than just computer calculations it was driving from Albuquerque up to Seattle and I got three very uh serious speeding tickets you got three yeah on that one trip on that one trip what's a long trip uh this is great I love this little car yeah these are pretty nice we were relieved to learned that the top speed of his allnew all electric Fiat red is only about 100 mph that car was a birthday gift from Bono yep that Bono as if there's any other well we've been working together on this Global Health stuff for a long time these days he's known largely for his philanthropic work especially on global health issues to date The Gates Foundation has given away nearly 80 billion dollar in Grants most of that from Gates and his former wife Melinda's own pocket but for most of us he'll always be the Microsoft Guy this is my last keynote even though he stepped down as CEO and uh quar Century the one thing that really held me back was what if I leave and the company's doing very poorly a I'll feel bad and B I won't know whether to you know jump back in or not but you know fortunately I've never had to even think about it because my successors have been amazing he was the Boy Wonder the Harvard Dropout and became a billionaire in his 30s by focusing not on building computers but selling the softare W that ran them please welcome Bill Gates and the Bill Gates dancers by the time he launched Windows 95 he was on top of the world he had every right to be dancing to The Rolling Stones and yucking it up with the likes of Jay Leno Windows 95 is so easy even a talk show host can figure it out but on this day as he drove us to his favorite Drive-In Burger Master the Seattle institution hey how's it going great all right welcome to start it for you Gates seemed less like one of the world's richest men we're here to go what do you think for here be on a tray on the window yeah we'll do the tray on the window and more like the kid who just used to come here with his dad decades before he'd be calling Sports Heroes rock stars and World dignitaries his friends my social skills were very slow to develop uh so except for a few boys similar to me I didn't have that many friends he's not saying that for sympathy he's just being analytical it's the way his mind works and it's the way the first of his three-part autobiography is written here is the the setup the source code that uh you know almost certainly was going to lead to some uh pretty amazing impact Bill Gates knew he was different so did his parents so did his teachers had he been growing up today he says he likely would have been diagnosed as autistic well when I'm concentrating I'll actually sometimes start rocking which bothers people without my even you know sort of being aware of it so I haven't even outgrown that uh uh type of behavior is the rocking kind of a soothing thing is it something you just do to concentrate what what do you think it must be I mean it's it's habit I mean they did put me on a rocking horse to help me go to sleep they put me in a cradle so it's definitely their fault uh whether he is or isn't on the Spectrum matters little he says I mean even today there's not like some magic medicine that gets rid of the bad part and let you keep the good part he writes that his parents took him to therapy sent him to private school and tried to unglue him from his books by getting him into sports like skiing even football I was forced to now that was on there were three teams there was the varsity the JB and then uh the even below JV and so we were the lowest tier and amongst that third tier I was semide decent but uh that's all that can be said almost everything he viewed through the prism of mathematics does he talk about math and being good at math and how that kind of revealed all these hidden structures in life and gave all the chaos of the world a certain amount of order which if you're like me who's not good at math all I see is sometimes chaos I don't see the patterns I don't see the the structures well you know I think science is beautiful thing that you know physics chemistry biology the more you learn the more kind of the pieces fit together because all these topics connect you're called a genius and I will well no I don't think that embarrassed you at all they call you a genius in conversation 40 years ago with arone Jane Polly the then William Gates II made it clear getting real excited was in charge of his Destiny I'm used to to having a company where um the ideas that I have are something that I can easily pursue are you competitive you think yes I people would say I'm competitive yes definitely I mean there was an industry panel once where everybody was disagreeing with me and at the end of the panel one of the competitor says look bill is wrong Bill works so much harder than we do he's going to succeed we might as well just give in you don't get to be part of that 1% club without making a few enemies along the way he is a complicated guy forcing us to divorce the internet from our operating system would be like requiring one of the automakers to sell cars without car stereos some say he was ruthless in his business practices and there are plenty of Chargers that today it's just part of a new American oligarchy you write in the book about how you said when you first came here as a freshman that you were like a kid in the candy Story how come there were glimpses of his determination even as a freshman at Harvard my room was this one here on the first floor you almost got kicked out for breaking the rules in the computer lab it turned out I'd Ed by far the most computer time and so they're like well what are you doing you know you're an undergraduate to it what the heck great to see you yeah it's impressive you're here his computer science Professor Harry Lewis remembers him well years ago he dug out the original code that Gates started writing over Christmas break in 1974 this was a uh work of beauty those pages of basic interpreter code became the Bible of the software Revolution the 69-year-old Gat says he's made plenty of mistakes including meeting with financers and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein although the tabloids had a field day with his divorce he now says that was one of his life's biggest regrets you know when I was a student um you know I was just trying to learn a lot I was very curious but for every critic how do you decide what to work on as somebody who's gone through many stages of their career there are just as many like these students at Harvard who speak of Bill Gates in the same breath as Thomas he you finished to she did well I almost finished mine and I got a double like his Burger sometimes Bill Gates has bitten off more than he can chew in his life maybe it was a way to challenge himself even in the face of those who still want to challenge him I've been unbelievably lucky and led a very interesting [Music] life it's not not [Music] stopping up next an exclusive excerpt from Lee cowen's chat with Bill Gates something you can only see right here on here comes the sun stay with us as promised here's more from Lee cowen's interview with Bill Gates did you learn anything you think about yourself in the process of writing the book well thinking back on where I was different you know like we went through the archives and got this 200 Page report I did on Delaware you know where the other kids turn in 10 page reports and even though that's WB kind of amazing yeah and I put real work into the the cover uh you know I remember feeling kind of embarrassed about that even though there was nothing really wrong with what I did any surprises things you remembered that maybe you hadn't talked about in a while or thought about you know the steadiness of my dad his values uh and how both my parents on their own way uh were very helpful you know getting my sisters to look it over and uh tell me what what rang true to them that was fun that you know it actually been more fun than I expected was it hard to step down as CEO I you know stayed as CEO until the year 2000 um and in some ways it was a relief to hand the re over to Steve Balmer who I knew super well and I stay another eight years so I'm yeah working for Steve for those eight years I'm allowing myself you know I do make in the year I step down as CEOs when I make the gift to the foundation that makes it the biggest in the world and so I'm part-time uh learning about philanthropy um no I once I made up my mind um I felt very comfortable with it where do you think your business Acumen came from well I've always had kind of this overs simplistic view that if you're good at math then a lot of things you should also be able to figure those things out you know so in business you have your income and your costs and you subtract those and you know try to get a good number and the software business you know was a great business because if you sell a lot of copies even at a very low cost cost you can have income that's not connected to your your costs and I was afraid you know many of the the companies I admired like Wayne computer had just gone out of business yeah and so we were like wow we had one period where we were short of cash and I I said I I never wanted that to happen again so partly because I you know was a bit conservative about how how quickly we built up our costs we could afford some mistakes I mean we had products didn't come out on time or products that weren't as popular as I thought they would be and you know math it's another place where math sort of helps you see what what the pieces are and how they they need to connect so at the end of the day what uh what do you want people to take away from this first part of your Memoir about your upbringing and how you sort of came to be well you know hopefully I'm acknowledging the amazing circumstances and with my parents and this the school that I went to and uh you I didn't go into all the individual teachers but they were so uh fantastic with me and you know maybe the way that I was challenged uh and given a lot of freedom you know maybe there's some lesson uh in that up next making time for a new film at the Museum of Modern Art welcome back Christian marlay first made a name for himself as part of New York's underground DJ Scene he was an early Pioneer of mixing sounds and styles using record turntables but after he began collaging album covers he realized he was drawn to the visual arts too Connor knon sat down with marlay to discuss his celebrated piece the clock now screening at the Museum of Modern Art in in New York City from time to time you might notice a shot of a clock in a movie in a film like Back to the Future their key to the plot lightning strikes the clock tower at exactly 10:04 [Music] p.m. but often they're just ticking away in the background Dad or not ticking at all this watch like the watch from Pulp Fiction stopped at 11:46 compile enough of these seemingly minute details and minutes can turn into hours spanning Decades of moving image history that clock what about it somebody obviously wanted us to know the time in the case of the clock a 24-hour film comprised entirely of clips from Cinema and television history that somebody is artist Christian marlay it's not to create a trick or to make you forget about time I want you to be totally conscious about it throughout the clock runs on a continuous loop sync to the precise time of day when the kids in The Breakfast Club are whistling at 11:31 a.m. it's 11:31 in real life Li an hour later Rainman announces it's 1231 minute by minute the footage functions as an actual clock this uncanny experience of watching some of your favorite movies and realizing that it's telling the time that you're living in right now and it's eliminating that barrier between you and the world on screen steuart comr is the chief curator of media and performance at MoMA the effort that it took with Christian and the team of researchers locating the clock footage and all of these different clips is somewhat superhuman when Mar Clay won best artist for the clock at the 20th 11 Venice bional it turned him into a contemporary art Superstar but the 70-year-old first made a name for himself decades earlier as part of New York's underground DJ Scene in those days you would find records you know people would put them in the trash born to an American mother and a Swiss father marlay was raised in Switzerland and moved to the US to attend art school in the late 1970s I kept putting aside my work as a visual artist cuz I lived in a tiny East Village apartment and I didn't have a studio so music at that time was convenient it's easier to store records than canvases yes but you need tolerant [Laughter] neighbors marclay's music was experimental he was an early Pioneer of turntablism please welcome record player Christian marlay invited to spin on the shortlived show night music [Music] I would destroy the records in performance but then I had all these incredible covers such an interesting history of graphic design and I started collaging with them one of marclay's early successes in the visual art World arrived via his body mix Series in which he physically stitched together album covers to create new forms he's unspooled cassette tapes to make prints and pillows this is the entire tape output of The Beatles woven together he's cut up everything from Japanese manga to movie subtitles stacking cinematic fragments nearly 20t tall seems like collage is the through line with all of this for me I'm more interested in working with what exists rather than you know invent or Draw Something In 1995 marlay created telephones a masterful mashup a film phone comp Sation darling it's me what the girl's dead are you sure do you have a positive ID um no not exactly it's been more than a decade since the clock was last in New York marlay is extremely precise about where and how it can be screened insisting that any Museum showing the work stay open at least once for 24 hours so that audiences can see the nighttime section are clock completists oh there are definitely clock squatter as I would say people you know who really commit to watching it but marklay insists the point isn't to see all of it it's more to make you hyper aware of the time you're spending literally watching a clock here you're reminded that you have an appointment at a certain time that you can't spend your whole day watching this thing you're more than a viewer you're a participant in a way because your life infringes on this clock I'm Tracy Smith thanks for joining us we'll see you here next time on Here Comes the Sun [Music]"

      "transcript": "this is a world where somebody can have over hundred billion dollar what is that these fortunes are almost illegitimate unless in a very smart way given back one of the biggest names in business Tech and philanthropy exploring and investing in innovative solutions to some of the world's toughest problems Bill Gates starting with Microsoft where I had monomaniacal Focus giving up weekends and vacation wasn't some big sacrifice I loved it the idea that everybody would use computer was somewhat ridiculed so it was kind of fun saying no no this is really going to be mainstream if you look at it from the outside you see Steve Jobs and yourself having this competition Envy jealousy what was it actually like he said we were the General Motors and he was Mercedes social networking we're still arguing about what the policy should be algorithms reward outrageous things even if they're not at all factual I've always underestimated how incredible my father was he would say hey I'm sorry I worked so hard and I'd say no no that was fine I feel lucky that he lived as long as he did it brings tears to my eyes because he was incredible do you remember one of the final conversations you had with him the number one Health and Wellness podcast J shett J shett he won the only J there's so much conversation today I feel about work like life balance do you think that that sacrifice and that dedicated time was necessary for the levels of success or would it have been possible in another way no I think for Microsoft to be successful even though we were the first we and we had a broader concept of software than the other companies we needed to be uh what I would call hardcore and you know in that case the work is what I want to do it's it's not like oh God you know I've got to earn a little bit more money it's you know this is the thing that throughout my childhood I was so lucky you know because of my parents and some early friends school I went to I had these exposures to computers that were very rare and so I had you know all these thousands of hours of programming experience and great feedback on okay how do you do it better from the very best adults I got to see what was coming and the idea being part of making that real you know I woke up and said okay I I'd love to get to work my younger self could stay in you know days at a time I I don't do that now but then it was just in no way h a hardship you know because I I you know felt we were part of something that uh was would be very empowering and you know competitively I wanted us to to be the ones to make it happen one of your favorite quotes that I've always loved is is you've said we overestimate what we can do in one year and we underestimate what we can do in 10 years at the beginning did you over or underestimate yourself well people when they would hear us say a computer on every desk and in every home uh running Microsoft software they were like you kids are really out of it I mean every desk every home you know what would people do these things but because the chips were improving exponentially doubling every couple of years it allowed us to think of the Computing part as essentially being free and so the only thing that would hold you back is you know okay can you help people with photographs can you help them with documents can you help them stay in touch with people far away or find information and we knew over time uh that as these things got better it would would be part of the mainstream and so as people sort of came around to that they were like wow whether it's at work or at home this is just part of how how people do things uh and we wanted you know to get it out to everyone you know students everywhere you know even in the the countries that are are lowincome you mentioned your parents earlier and when I was reading this book I felt like they are such a big part of this book and the storytelling and the incredible experiences and memory and one of the things you mention is you say that they felt that they accepted that you were different from your peers and I was wondering in what way how did you know that they had seen that and accepted that well it definitely confounded them that sometimes I was pushing back in a pretty tough way you know as though you know we were in some competition uh they would hear from teachers and they were very good about staying in touch with my my teachers you know some teachers would say this kid should be ski ah had one or two grades some teachers would say this kid should be held back you know so that kind of is what you know make up your mind you know I had one experience where I worked on a a report about the state of Delaware and I ended up doing this 200 Page Report with the Greatwood cover well the other kids turned in you know five or 10 page reports and it was very embarrassing that I thought wow did I you know kind of overdo this thing and yet you know that ability to concentrate you know would hold me in good stad in terms of reading long books and applying that concentration and curiosity first to cards then to math and then finally to software and how would software change the world uh but you know they never were quite sure what to do and you know sending me to a therapist actually ended up being brilliant uh and sending me to a very nice private school where the classes were a bit smaller and you know I could get I always got an unfair share of attention from the teachers you know we'd have like 15 people in the class but you know almost 20% of the teacher time in terms of telling me what to read or you know marking uh my writing up you know I I got an unfair share partly because my curiosity or energy level you know did Mark me out in both positive and and negative ways yeah what what influence do you think Dr cresy actually had on you because therapy at that time and in your early age looking back on it now what do you feel it gave you what skills did it give you well it's a very it was a very rare thing in fact the other people coming to him were these couples that were having arguments and so in a I hope privacy appropriate way he would kind of give me a sense of that he gave me a few IQ tests he you know had me read about Freud and all these things but slowly but surely he was saying to me that fighting your parents really has no purpose I mean they really do love you they're on your side you should apply your energy uh towards other things and you know eventually he made me feel kind of foolish like yeah why was I taking these what I thought were kind of arbitrary rules or where my mom would say you should respect me and I'd say well you know I don't know and a little bit as I figured out I could understand things like playing cards as well are better than my grandmother or you know I could read books that had complicated things I was a bit showing off to saying because my cognition is good why should you be able to set arbitrary rules but anyway I'm embarrassed when I think about it now uh but Dr cressie was so encouraging to me in general and then got across uh he probably understood at the first meeting you know that I uh had to be convinced to make has change but he did it in this a super nice way and and so the idea that no my parents yes they're imperfect but wow they're on my side that that changed my behavior yeah and did he also had these beautiful ways of you said he never belittled you and I believe he used to mention to you you're going to win or or he wanted you to win and I feel like that's what what did those things do because it's almost like you're saying he made you have this almost this realization that you were wrong but it seemed like he did it in a very graceful elegant way like how did how did he do that absolutely they you know I thought oh I need to be so clever to win and I'm going to apply all this energy to win and so the idea when he says no you're going to win it's like oh I see it's not because I'm clever it's because it's us you know they they care for me and they're trying you know to help me and you know their main concern is am I ready you know to go out in the world and if I have capabilities will I develop those and use those and you know my mom always had a way of kind of pushing me to do more I said to her once you know you told me to go to the heart of school and she said no I never actually said that and I said to her well wait a minute when other parents would come over you'd say how bad they must feel that their kid didn't go to college or something like that's so okay it was indirect but you know it was kind of there so you know my mom certainly encouraged me you know and sometimes I felt overwhelmed uh by that but my eventual reaction to just okay try to outdo any uh levels she set and ended up working out well yeah what was something that you didn't value about your mom at that time that now looking back you say no I do value that well things like table manners uh I'm like well you know okay I have to take the ketchup and put it in a bowl and then do this and I'm not supposed to put my elbows on the table and you know she was just you know trying to make sure I was uh civilized a little bit you know uh what I would wear and they definitely got me engaged with adults you know my social skills were slow to develop uh with people other than a few boys like myself but with adults because they were having them over and I you know got so I could ask those adults to talk about what they were doing that was really valuable to me cuz I ended up through that and uh through one of my early friends having more of an Outlook of okay where am I headed at quite a young age um which uh was was super helpful yeah it's it's so funny as I was reading the book I was reminded of so when I graduated from college I didn't go to my graduation ceremony because I left to become a and my parents were they were very kind and accepting of my decision but my mother still has this feeling that she doesn't have a picture of me graduating wearing the hat and you know holding my certificate and I remember I was having the same feeling that you were where my mom would always may say to me oh when I go to my friend's houses they're telling me about all the jobs that their kids are doing and the apartment they just moved into and you're just there being a monk like you know she'd say that to me and it was always kind of feeling like that that sense of pressure to live up to something she wanted me to do even though there was love and there was acceptance and I was wondering for you like you you said it yourself she was such a Powerhouse she had such high expectations when did you feel that you reached that or do you feel you've reached that well unfortunately my mom passed away in her early 60s she uh she got breast cancer and uh so I had gotten married six months uh before she passes away so she never got to see that I tried to follow her example as a a parent uh she never got to see the foundation uh get going my dad actually ran the foundation and got it off to a fantastic start so he was involved but her sort of dictate about okay if you are successful you have to give back it's a a shame uh that she didn't get to uh kind of participate and uh see that I'm f me what she said uh despite all the times I I pushed back on her yeah do you still feel that today that it's almost like she her voice is in your head and she's present in that way oh absolutely the you know the sense I have of okay I've got to do this and do that well that's you know really came from her my dad more set the example of being calm and thoughtful you know also great great values but much you know it wasn't through the the interaction he would you know leave pretty early and if my mom had to escalate to call him in you knew you better give in uh because that was kind of the the ultimate thing but yeah so each in their own way he through example her through high expectations deserve a lot of credit and you know part of this book is to really honor them and uh two of the young friends I had who set me on a uh a great path well it's pretty insane this is a world where somebody can have over hundred billion doll I mean that you know what is that you know you don't want to just give that to children and create some Dynasty that's not even a favor to them sadly the wealth metric is an easier one to compute than uh you know the impact you've had philanthropically I have a a good friendship both with uh Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg Elon stands by himself uh maybe that drives everybody else together I don't know I was wondering what was your biggest realization about your father from writing this book it's weird I've always underestimated how incredible my father was his his values even the exchange with my mom you know before they get married um his one of his dreams was to be a federal judge and he eventually that was offered to him and because his law firm uh would have had great difficulty he said no I that would hurt my colleagues so I'm not going to do that and I had written him a note saying gosh I hope it's not because you had to pay all that tuition that you're not getting to do this and I'd forgotten he'd written me back such a nice note so you know in digging through I'm amazed we end up keeping those things it was so touching to me now I you know I'll I'll spend my whole life trying to live up to to the example he set what was it like finding that reply forgetting that he had replied I mean no well certainly it brings tears to my eyes because you know he he was incredible and towards the end of his life we did get a little more direct you know where he would say hey I'm sorry I work so hard and I'd say no no that was fine to uh to be doing that you know and so instead of things being sort of through my mom when she was gone he had to build up that communication in a way it was far more intimate you know I I feel lucky that he lived as long as he did how did how does that as that relationship evolves like it felt like when I was reading source code I felt like your father was there to always save you in these moments like he'd pick up the phone he'd be involved in you know talking to you and your friends like he was there in these very pivotal moments that felt like almost professional support from him of course based on his intelligence and background as well but it sounds like that evolved to a much more emotive intimate space like what does that what does that look like for a father and a son across all those years you know and when I was going off to college you know I'd call my parents every couple of weeks but you know you couldn't like text and send photos and so but I always knew you know that they were supportive and so I actually got into a little bit of trouble where I taken my colleagues into the computer center and done some of the early Microsoft basic work and the college as they filled position to supervise that computer CER we're like wow did you break the rules and you know my dad was always so kind of wise you know when I ever was like oh my God I may have screwed up here I I better get on top of this you know that's a time where I call him in and his advice is very helpful you know then later we have a customer who's not paying us and our very first customer another case where my dad encouraged me to stay the course so it wasn't in those days that I talked to him a lot but that when I was in trouble he was the one person you know who was so sophisticated and you know on my side that his advice really did uh help at a lot of uh key uh turning points and you know then later when we have a relationship where we actually talk intimately I I was able to to thank him for that do you remember one of the final conversations you had with him and well he got Alzheimer's and he because he was such a nice person he was still like super nice you know always worried did his caregivers get enough meals or you know eventually the fact he grew up up in the depression showed cuz he'd be worried about you know are we buying too expensive a meal you know even though he had as much money as he he he could ever need you know so you know we got back to his basic character which was just very uh friendly and and thoughtful uh so yes I I feel like in his case we did have those conversations that that I I never got to have with my mom there's the one phone call you described the three words he used of I hear you when he was talking uh to the school and that left such a strong imprint could you tell us why that was such a big moment for you at that time well I was in this uh contract discussion with this group I thought you know owed me some computer time so that's the first time that my dad is pitching in to help and you know I thought what's he gonna do is he gonna you know threaten them or be tough on them and no not at all the fact that they sort of gave their side of the argument and then you know he just simply said I hear you which was this very this way of saying you know I don't agree with that you know let's try and reach a compromise here you have your point of view so just the way he said I hear you you know kept things really calm didn't acknowledge or attack their position so we could get on to the hey you know if you meet these guys halfway isn't that okay for both of you here which is is what uh eventually came out of it and so the idea of being subtle and helping to find that Common Ground I was young enough to that was kind of blew my mind yeah wow you can kind of uh hold your ground but without being provocative what would you say is the one way your mother influenced your parenting style and then your father influenced your parenting style well this idea that uh is actually kind of school called love and logic where you make expectations to the child very very clear and you make consequences very very clear and in an unemotional way you say no you're going to have to go to your room because we agreed if you did this that's what happens my dad practiced that approach my mom probably wanted to but then if she was frustrated you know she'd be oh I'm so disappointed and kind of bring emotion into it so the intensity of how much my mom cared I you know I think that was was great and I think kind of that calm predictable hey the world uh Works in a clear way and you know I'm on top of the world and here's what I need from you you know that very much came from my dad so I tried to be a little more around you know my my wife Melinda did deserves all the credit you know that our kids have come out so well because she what really was around but I I tried to be that's the one thing I did a bit differently than my dad was was uh more more intense vacation time a little bit more of a direct communication not through their mother how did you reconcile that towards the end about your father's style and how did you make space for that and accept that in that generation you know my dad's career was a very big thing in fact having all all sorts of adults around for events you know was connected to his career and you know he did very well he was a a top lawyer in Seattle so I never resented the idea that that my my dad was very busy you know you had kids early you know the man's C is important later my mom also not only is doing volunteer activities but as people wanted women on boards because she had the right background she got a huge number of those opportunities and she uh got a little busy herself um you know I don't think the amount of time is the only the only key factor there yeah I'd have to agree I was I when I was reading it too I was thinking that and and this what I found so interesting bill when I was reading source code that even though you have lived such a otherworldly life in so many ways there were so many relatable moments from a a parenting standpoint and when I was reading it I was thinking about my father too who wasn't around a lot when I was younger he was working both my parents had to work and to the point you just made right now like my father wasn't there when I was playing rugby or he wasn't there when I was swimming for my you know local club or he he wasn't there on the sidelines cheering and for me that really allowed me to become the man I wanted to be and it allowed me to have more freedom almost to not feel like there was this heavy expectation and I've always seen that as a positive thing because it allowed me to have a broader definition of what it meant to be a man what it meant to be a son what what it meant to go off and discover something that I was passionate about and so even seeing you kind of having your mother be the one who was almost you know pushing the expectation and what the family should be but then having a bit of freedom it was interesting to see how that impacted you to be able to push back to be able to you know even at one point like you said in that letter like parent him almost in his decision uh and and and played that role so it it was refreshing for me to read a book about you where I was where I was actually seeing parts of myself uh in certain relationships in a very relatable way did you did you ever anticipate that when you were writing it I was surprised you know so when I'm describing going on those hikes I was thinking boy would I have let my son go off uh and we really are holding back children a bit more you know out of a sense of okay ultimate safety I guess but you know in that generation I was allowed to take trips and Hikes and and I think it benefited me and so writing the book I was like wow and you you've talked with people like Jonathan hey about this are we a bit overprotecting you know kids so that they don't get to make you know mistakes or try themselves out or mature the way that is is best for them do you think schools failing children if you have 30 people in a class it's it's pretty tough you're going to have some kids who are behind and some are are ahead you know even the best teacher has got a a big challenge with that education I wouldn't say is much better or worse today than a few decades ago we've always thought okay when we bring the computer in you know will that helpful and certainly if you want to find information it's been great we're still working on that now with the AI maybe a personal tutor will be encouraging and work on your level uh it's early days but I've been out seeing some of that in classrooms people like Saul con with kigo that our foundation is is helping to support but education uh it the the computer has not made it so wow kids learn a lot more today uh than they did did a long time ago and I I I still believe we can change that but it means if you're in one of those large classes you can feel lost and you know we're we're missing you know great human potential you tend to manage other people the way you manage yourself the first time I felt it was when I was hiring people who Moved their family and they had kids and I was like if I can't pay this guy's check this is rude you know he's got a real problem and I'm kind of implicitly promising him I've got this thing figured out uh so that scared me what is your favorite mental health habit this show is sponsored by better help we talk a lot about red flags in

the ability to download more and learn more where have we gone wrong well the key is is motivation if you have a kid who's super motivated then yes going to the con website and doing you know hours of math problems that's great but in a way that takes the kid who's in that top 20% and makes him even more intimidating to the other ones and you know people can come in if a kid in eth grade says is math a subject you have any confidence in if they answer no to that they're five times more likely to drop out and so we do lose kids and it's more out of motivation and so most of the stuff we've done on the computer is about okay if you are motivated we'll help you out out and not so much about how you make it feel relevant to them and give them a sense of success and maybe this time around with these AI personal tutors we'll we'll get that right but kids check out of no I'm I'm not one of those kids who's good at math even though for a lot of professions and you know for college courses we require Algebra 2 uh tests to be passed in order to go on and you know even be a nurse or a policeman so we have we have work to do yeah uh but more on on the motivational side yeah I really I really appreciate you saying that actually because I do think that we think about changing education is so theoretical and functional but it is the drive it is the motivation and I was thinking about how we put limits on ourselves when I finished sixth grade I remember before I went to high school my favorite subject was math in sixth grade and my least favorite subject was art and then when I finished high school my most favorite subject was Art and my least favorite subject was math and it was just fascinating to me how that completely flipped over a seven-year period And as as I've grown up in my own life I found that Art and Design philosophy economics are far more where I naturally gravitate toward but so much of that up until sixth grade was the limits or the things that were expected of me as opposed to what I was motivated and driven towards and I was thinking about something you said in the book you you said that if you were growing up today you would have been diagnosed with uh being on the autism spectrum and I was wondering how would that have affected you how do you think that would have affected you yeah I'm fascinated by that because for some people being given a label is a pejorative to them and you know almost feels shameful although we know you know being on the Spectrum gives you you know almost some superpowers of concentration that if you find the right place it can be helpful other people it they're glad when they get that because then it they say oh that's why you know my social skills were slow to develop and you know here's some strategies that people like me have used I'm not alone in this you know I I fit in into this and it's actually a uh reasonably common thing there isn't like some medicine ADHD you know which I probably also would have been diagnosed with uh they do have the Focalin ater all a variety of things they give kids for that and I I still wonder about that I haven't chosen as an adult to get a diagnosis or use those medicines I think eventually you learn to you know adapt I still kind of rock a little bit that when I'm thinking hard and without even knowing it and it does bother people sometimes and that's definitely kind of a what they call self simulation uh behavior that you know makes it pretty likely I I fit into that uh diagnosis do you think it would have changed your trajectory of success have you thought about that or I I worry that I might have thought of it as pejorative it's it's really how you communicate it I mean if you say hey here's a kid who doesn't socialize at all and you're you know sort of destined to you know never be good at those things um you know obviously to create a company hire people motivate people go out and you know sell the the dream of computing I've had to even though I'm not a natural you know develop a lot of social behaviors and it might have discouraged me unless it it was done in a a very tasteful way you know I think of that Dr cresy experience where he didn't make me feel terrible while enlightening me that I was wasting my time as well as my parents' time yeah did you did you continue therapy after that or ever go yes again uh most periods of my life I found it useful to have a therapist where I'm talking to about you know what's confusing or or what's troubling I think you know I'm I'm very lucky to have that I think particularly if you have a life where some extreme things happen that you know luck is a huge part of that to you know keep your you know keep you on the ground a good therapist can play an invaluable role there so yeah I I've benefited to this day from those kind of conversations yeah well I was thinking about in the book obviously you beautifully introduced us to Kent and obviously the loss of Kent seems to be a place in your memory that's naturally so difficult and and fuzzy and you talk about in the book how you're not quite sure what your parents would have said and and how it all felt and I was just wondering if there were any did you did you have support at that time through therapy and other ways to deal with that grief no and I've been looking recently people like Anderson Cooper are talking about okay how do you deal with grief and you know a lot of what they come up with is that if you can keep talking about the person and you know what you got from them you're kind of honoring them you know Kent's parents obviously were the most affected by this because you know they would never have this in incredible son and you know who would have no doubt gone off and done incredible things and I remember spending time with them for like a year afterwards and then feeling a bit guilty that as I got busy uh I didn't do that as much you know in the book I actually start out where I've seen Kent's father I run into him right as I'm uh starting work on the book and you know we can talk about what a great influence he had on me and you know so I did I did think that was helpful but boy it took me a long time because death it was just such a shocking thing I have this idilic childhood other than Kent's death nothing at all traumatic and we're talking all the time you know a little bit I reach out to Paul to kind of feel Paul Allen who goes on to found Microsoft with me to step in and you know be that that super close friend uh but back then the idea of how you dealt with trauma was mostly hey buck up you know get on with things which after a few months I I did yeah and also at that time you're talking about how he actually invited you on the trip he went to and like you're talking just before he goes off and then all of a sudden you're like wait a minute we used to talk every day or you know and and that it can feel so disassociated from yourself in that moment it feels like how did you revisit that when did you kind of turn towards working through the grief as you wrote the book did it feel like you were revisiting it because definitely you know at the that high school when I I built a hall in his name and you know gone out there and talked a little bit about um the the role that Kent played in my Evolution you know so some efforts to honor him you know sadly you know Paul Allen also the other key friend in this book died I think about six years ago from cancer and you know he he also was very key at getting me on the right path and there wouldn't be you know without those two friends you know there really wouldn't probably wouldn't be anything like Microsoft yeah you talk about how Paul was setting you little challenges and would ask you to you know try this or do that and then you'd go ahead and I was thinking how amazing to have a friend that could motivate and inspire you in that way and then I was thinking about what you just said when I was reading the book that it felt like you told so many stories of so many people in your life that are no longer here now and so grief wasn't just about Kent or Paul it was there's so you know just so many individuals that you've had life with that you're having to process that with what has been helpful for you genuinely deeply inside that has led to some sort of helpful Direction with that grief of writing a book about all these wonderful people that you've lost well most of my life has been about looking forward yeah and okay let's get this Innovation let's do it first and you know whether it's software uh saving children's lives which is the the big Foundation thing and it is a little bit unnatural for me to look back because you have to say okay how do I describe my relationship with my mom in a open honest way and and yet honor her you know how do I talk about K where I don't know if he' lived what would have happened but uh you know probably you know something that he he would have very much been a part of it and so it's it's awkward to look back because you you have to deal with these things and talk about you know you know should have I have spent more time with this parents afterwards you know because eventually I I stopped doing that uh but you know this year I turned 70 I mentally don't feel like I think of a 70-year-old but you know it means you know I'm in the the final third uh no doubt of you know what i' I've been very lucky to to live and so you know I I really did force myself I know there's some lessons out of this you know telling people how lucky I was and maybe a few lessons for them as as parents or how they uh navigate uh success and so once we got going on it I've enjoyed it quite a bit I have to say when I'm reviewing it and editing it I'm very slow because I'm you know reliving these things so it always takes me about three times longer to take some pages and and edit than I I predict or if it was you know something like about climate or pandemics you know I'm I'm pretty fast there's no deep emotion that I have to relive as I'm uh editing uh something scientific yeah what what was your favorite part to relive and what was the hardest part to relive well everything about the fascination we had and you're like what we see this thing these computers are going to be amazing and but no one else is saying that so we must be wrong um that's crazy and you know that contradiction so you know Paul actually I helped him get a job out in Boston so he could be out there and and bugging me that okay should we go build a company and then finally when this kit computer which is so limited but it's the beginning of the Revolution when that comes out then you know Paul's argument we should go and do something he he wins because we don't want to be left behind we want to want to be there from the very beginning and then we meet a few people although it was still very small move we meet other people like Steve wnac Steve Jobs who also you know have been infected with this idea of okay we're on to to something that uh is going to be huge that Paul I mean the the research that you did to find in this book I was every time I was reading I was just like how do you have so much detail I was really Blown Away by the level of detail both in the storytelling every moment but then even there's that note that you have that says Steve Jobs called was rude and I was just like you know even just having that back then I was I was laughing as I read it and and I was wondering like I feel like as from the outside and naturally and and you talk about this later on in the book how we see people as this like Slither of who they are and people have a public profile and that becomes their brand and if you look at it from the outside you see Steve Jobs and yourself having this competition Envy jealousy kind of like arch rival Nemesis kind of portrayal what was it actually like because it in the book it comes across much more um inviting them that as opposed to this kind of harsh rivalry well I had a fantastic relationship with Steve you know early on I got to do the the basic which they called apples that went with every uh Apple 2 computer uh so I worked with both jobs and MNC uh to get that done then later as Steve has a kind of small group inside Apple doing the Macintosh he invited Microsoft to write application software a spreadsheet word processor for it and so we actually had as many people as they did and we worked very closely on that project and he and I loved the fact that you know that ended up being a a key Apple product um then he leaves Apple I talk to him about next but I never thought that computer would do that well so he was disappointed uh but then when he goes back and he's un it's unbelievable what a great job he did because Apple went from being on the way to dine to being the world's most valuable company and Steve had really matured and it's was something and I you know we we helped write software for that then later when Steve uh is sick we had about five different conversations where we got to talk about kids and you know had computers done well and you know where he was pretty thoughtful it's amazing to me that Steve you know his skill set and mine other than okay you know madman leader you know drawing people in but he his taste in design and user interface and even his intuition about people he was just genius in a way you can't explain he didn't look at code and write code whereas you know my thing is hey I'm an engineer you know here's the code let's make it faster and and smaller so actually that allowed us to get along because you know what he was super good at I was not good at I envied those just incredible talents that he has in some ways he's more singular you know if you say to me are there other people like you who are great at writing code and conceptualizing yeah I can name a number of people including many who worked with me but I don't know somebody who's who I say oh yeah you know he he's just like Steve Jobs wow well that's very humble of you as well I mean that's it's beautiful to hear what were some of those final conversations like that you had with him that were potentially I always felt like he was so philosophical and maybe more so in those moments yeah we did one public appearance you know where we were being thoughtful about the Friendship uh Walt Mossberg had us had us on stage together which was definitely a fun thing and surprised people because Steve was very harsh uh you know he was a you know he said we were the General Motors and he was like the Mercedes uh uh but you know all in uh it was all very fair well we you know we reflected that computers really hadn't improved education and we're both he and I had given speeches saying of course this will make education you know five times better and we're like wow uh we got that one wrong maybe you know maybe next round uh we'll deliver on that promise and you know how unusual it was even a little bit lonely that you know when you were so successful and then you're having doubts about okay are we making uh mistakes here um you know both of us had had kids by then he was actually uh you know of course he not only did Apple he did the Pixar stuff and because that was a realm I I'm not in I you know could sincerely tell him what a brilliant job he did now partly picking people but that's you know kind of amazing uh you know now part of of Disney and you know and both a sense of thankfulness although you know he was very and just hoping some new drug would come along and tragically it it didn't yeah was there a memor memorable piece of advice or conversation where you said something to him or he said something to you that has stayed with you well the fact that you know why were we both so competitive and pushing ahead I I think both of us you know in his case he's an orphan so he has a more complicated childhood that maybe can explain his Zeal um I don't have any like that you know even though Kent died that's not why you know well before that I was somehow always you know pushing as hard as I could be um and you know I think both of us you know being thankful for what we'd been able to work on I mean you know we got more of a front row seat and helped build this thing Steve never got around to doing philanthropy now his uh Widow Loren is doing great philanthropy so you know that's uh I'm sure he' he'd be proud of that but he didn't get to that stage and I was just getting into that stage so I shared with him a little bit about wow a lot of children die and we don't do much to stop that and that kind of intrigued him but then he never got to pursue it yeah you're you're reminding me of something I read in Bob iger's book where he was talking about how there was a time when Spielberg George lucus they'd all sit together and then they'd watch each other's movies and give them feedback and they all felt very confident doing that because they knew their strengths and their uniqueness were so diverse and so they didn't feel threatened that oh well Steph's going to steal my idea or you know George Lucas is going to steal my idea because they felt so confident and it sounds like even for yourself as competitors to talk to have a relationship does that still happen today do do competitors talk do they pick up the phone to each other or is that very rare because it feels like it feels definitely now so less uh I have a a good friendship both with uh Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg Elon stands by himself uh maybe that drives everybody else together I don't know uh and you know over time I think Elon uh as he gets older maybe he'll mellow out a little bit and uh you know probably be a incredible philanthropist based on everything else that he's done but yes there is some good conversation you know Larry Ellison is now in a phase where he's doing some excellent uh philanthropy and we're all a bit more reflectable I mean hopefully by the time you get to 70 You' been you've been hyper successful you can you know relax and let your guard down a little bit and you know laugh about uh the things you got wrong yeah what what was some of the advice that you've given to Mark or especially earlier on his journey or even more recently yeah well you know Microsoft uh the one big challenge we had is we were so successful by the late 90s that we got into antitrust difficulties and in retrospect we could have handled that better and so I've been very uh open with Mark you know I used to brag that I didn't have an office in DC and I didn't you know what a great country that I didn't have to talk to politicians well that was a mistake uh and you know now you know you've got all of them going to the inauguration and you know so they're not they're not making that mistake uh maybe they have they corrected too much in the other direction well you know his history will will judge so yeah I'm you know it's weird to be kind of an elder Statesman uh you know Saia who runs Microsoft has done such a a brilliant job and you one of my great fears when I left Microsoft to go do philanthropy was how bad I would feel if it wasn't doing well and so Steve Balmer did a great job and now SAA with this AI generation so i' that's another great blessing is that not only the value of the stock but also the fact I can just focus on okay what about polio and malaria you know knowing that they're they're taking the the company to new heights you know what what a great blessing uh that's been for me yeah it seems like I love what you were just saying now that you know maybe there'll be a time when Elon turns to philanthropy and you talked about others and it and it seems that that turning point for you is so key and I feel like you were one of the first not that it wasn't done before but one of the first to do it in a really big way to be able to move away from this big company that you founded world changing um generation changing and then turning to that and that service element to me I was intrigued as to why do you believe that that's almost where every one of these people need to go like why is it that you believe that turning to a life of service and giving back is core for Elon whoever else it may be well it's pretty insane this is a world where somebody can have over hundred billion dollars I mean that you know what is that and it's not you know you don't want to just give that to children and create some Dynasty that's not even a favor to them you want to give that back so these are unprecedented fortunes and if you're a great innovator and you know how to gather scientists together and think about problems then there are some government is risk averse and particularly poor countries don't have that capacity to think about eradicating malaria or solving malnutrition it there is something that philanthropy can have these outsized results in terms of lives saved almost like you know a great startup uh does on the S of innovation so getting those Minds to turn those capacities to equity to the poorest both inside the US and outside the US you know I feel that you know we've got the golden rule we're we're supposed to care about people there are times when it feels like sympathy for poor people outside the country is lower today uh than it's been but I know that'll come back around because of the the moral logic there I think uh I I believe is is is very very strong and I you know I found it so fulfilling you I created a a group called giving pledge of of people who've uh committed to give the majority of their wealth away and we learn from each other hopefully we Inspire each other and hopefully we change the societal expectations that if you have even a modest Fortune most of it should combine with your your talents and make the world a a bit more of a a a fair fair Place yeah I think I I think it's absolutely brilliant because I was really fortunate when I when I went out and lived uh as part of my time as a monk in India we helped uh put together a well the monks were doing already but I got to be a part of it uh helped build a um daily food distribution service in India that feeds a million kids a day and it was all in exactly what you're saying like to help the malnutrition children and now they're even trying to figure out how much protein into having it Lear like trying to figure out the actual composition as well and I remember seeing that so early in my life like I would have gone out there first time in my teens and then later on when I became a monk in my early 20s but the reason I raise it is because I think it goes back to what the point you made earlier about motivation and one thing I've really been trying to figure out with the right partner recently is how when I grew up I remember my dad used to read the rich list and he'd have the rich list like the Sunday time or whatever it was and so as a kid I would see my dad and on the back of it would be the rich list and I was thinking how incredible would it be if kids grew up with a service list and how would that change motivation because I feel we reward we repeat what we reward and I feel like we've never really seen that case study yet up until maybe you know your case study and and the people that are following with the giving pledge that service becomes a natural part of life at that scale I think we see it in smaller communities you see people with very little actually doing so much but you don't necessarily see it at that level and so I find that changing that drive and motivation early on which it seems like your mother had for you your impact of Faith had in you I think that could be huge I don't know what you think about people seeing a service list instead of a rich list or whatever the right word is sadly the wealth metric is an easier one to compute than uh you know the impact you've had philanthropically and part of the beauty of philanthropy is there's many causes out there you know I've tried to Think Through okay you know since we know how to save lives for ,000 per life saved wow we better you know use this money uh as absolutely best we can and I do think we're going to see a rise in philanthropy I mean you know these fortunes are almost illegitimate unless they are in a very smart way given back if it's consumption if it's Dynasty I don't think Society should feel that good about it and you know I I sat down with Bernie Saunders and he said no he would outlaw billionaires I I think that's a mistake I think allowing in America in particular wild Innovation wild risk-taking uh is good but then on the backside of that there there should be a strong expectation and I think role models help a lot you know Warren Buffett in very different industry very different skill set you know he's always been a role model and was the one who who even when I was uh still building the fortune said okay your mom is right you know and here's some books you should read you know Carnegie Gospel of wealth the history of what rock of did and know because this this will be an important as as important a measure of your impact as as making the money yeah I think that's such a brilliant lesson and wonderful one to pass on what I think it was Trump who mentioned recently that you'd asked to see him to have a discussion did that meeting ever happened yeah I had a a very long and actually very impressive dinner in terms of he asked good questions uh you know I talked about over 10 million people are alive because of us generosity uh with HIV medicines going back to uh President Bush in 2003 and you know I encourage him to keep that as a priority and to accelerate Innovation uh you know there's an idea that you might be able to cure AIDS that we're working on and he could help accelerate that I talked about polio eradication and how uh his leadership and the US government resources are very important there and you know I'm sure everybody's trying to meet with him the fact he gave me that long period of time was actually pretty thoughtful in his questions you know somebody may come along later and tell them to cut that money but I make the argument as best I can uh that you know the moral purpose of the US and and how we're thought of and you know the fact that a cure is is on its way that's worthwhile uh you know so this Administration in in charge and you know trying to help them you know they're willing to cancel old things some of which should maybe be canceled some which shouldn't you know so they're you know helping direct them so they'll use their open-mindedness to do different things and try and make that come out well I you I think that's that's worth trying yeah what what do you see as the moral purpose of the United States and the way you mentioned it just now well we've been The Shining Light of not only being a democracy ourselves and you know having political opponents respect each other and work well together but also you know saying that even though we're in this very powerful position we won't abuse that position and okay if we allowed ourselves you know to let other people spend too little on some things you know there's there's a balance there but if you become too much of a bully and you're not keeping democracy which you know requires reducing the polarization uh and bridging some of these divides and that's a little bit scary you know democracy is a a fragile concept and particularly at a time when AI is coming along and the government will have to play a strong role and saying okay these jobs have been lost but we're more productive overall and therefore here's how we help uh those people you know how do we keep AI as a primarily beneficial Thing versus a uh thing that bad people use and it messes up these job markets that I expect the 2028 presidential debate AI policies will be the most important thing and I was a little bit surprised in this election that wasn't uh discussed hardly at all yeah that's such a good point I I didn't actually think of that but you're right it didn't it didn't come up a tool yeah that's f what how I mean how do you prepare for something like that it would need need to be surrounded by the right people and having the parties well you've got to educate everyone you know you can't count on the technologist to shape these things you know social networking we're still arguing about what the policy should be and you know the fact that algorithms reward outrageous things that even if they're not at all factual and AI heightens all of that and you know this is an era where getting the politicians to see the technology including all this good stuff personal tutors better Medical Care even making the government more efficient you know this is the most promising set of tools because bureaucratic paperwork you know AIS actually are pretty darn good at at reading and uh processing uh those kinds of things so you know we're on the precipice of the AI breakthroughs the reliability and uh capabilities you know it's kind of an extension of what I worked on as a a child you know personal computers then internet then cell phones uh and now ai but it's because it's it's super intelligence um it's of a different character and we'll it'll put us to the test on how we work together within the US and how how countries work together yeah it's uh interesting because as you talking about social media there I think Mark Zuckerberg on J Rogan was saying that they are taking away their fact Checkers and I believe ax is X is doing something similar what was your take on that you know this whole thing of how you balance Free Speech versus not you know discouraging people from using vaccines when that would be beneficial for them or even extreme stuff like Holocaust denial or some bad things there I'm a little bit disappointed that my generation hasn't got a clear prescription to how uh we achieve both the goals free speech and yet uh uh reasonable discourse that's not misleading people I mean during the pandemic you know the negativity about vaccines some of which you know had me being some you know weird Mis behaving actor you know which was a lot of craziness you know clearly over a million people died who should have benefited uh from the vaccine and next time you know whether it's an outof control AI or the next pandemic the impact of of not getting facts out could be much more dramatic I mean the next you could have a pathogen that was 10 times or 20 times as fatal as covid was particularly once h comes along the fatality rate is actually reasonably modest and and mostly Elder people so politics meets AI uh is is where a lot of our Fates will be determined even in the the next 10 years and how do you see a role in that well hopefully there's some things I I really do uh understand about that and whether it's giving advice to Microsoft in my foundation work on education and health you know using it you know the place where you have the greatest shortage of teachers and doctors is in poor countries in Africa and so the fact that these things you know can give Farmers advice and give a pregnant women advice and look at what your kid is eating and say no you need more protein in this diet and it's essentially free you know the way that Computing was free that I saw when I was young now we're getting into this even more radical thing of intelligence will uh basically be free you know that that's kind of wild stuff so I hope both with some specific ideas but then with the lessons of a past of you know where we've been able to shape things so far you know so that I think personal Computing has largely been an empowering thing you know I was reading this book Nexus where Harari says then when the prin press comes along it actually is books about witches uh and how you find witches that are the bestselling so just thinking because we have new capabilities that we necessarily use them at first in a net beneficial way that's sadly a a naive concept yeah that I mean you've raised such a good point there even this idea I loved what you said that you said you wish your generation could have figured out how to have not have these extreme polarizing conversations but actually find this healthy Middle Ground whether that be through algorithms whether that be through how we use technology what is it that why do we keep doing that it almost feels like that's a repeated mistake where we come across this Horizon of this new world new technology new ideas but then we always use it for almost the same thing or something that feels you know insignificant compared to what it could do where where are we going wrong why can't we get that right well it's kind of amazing how well human is done you know the you know the violent death rate over hundreds of years have gone down a lot you know more recently we've gotten uh vaccines out to children and gotten the annual death rate from 10 million a year at the turn of the century down to about 5 million vaccines being the biggest uh part of that because we got them out to most of the world's children so Humanity for a a being that grew up in these small Hunter gather groups now you know we have big cities complex technology our ability to get along you know in some ways has been good you know nuclear weapons that when I was young you know my greatest fear was okay there was going to be a nuclear war and I do worry the current generation uh doesn't have that exposure to it so you know the arms treaties and you know spending too much money on building those weapons I do worry that we've lost uh track on that one but at least you know we haven't uh used those and you know we've done pretty well so far and you know will we this time I think this is is probably the hardest Innovation because you know we do have human limitations they even I when I see an outrageous article against somebody I don't like politically I'm very tempted to click on it and have it tell me yeah he's even stupider than you thought or you know he this is a a mistake you know we're all uh subject uh to that and and we do like to form into groups but you know all of humanity ideally is a group where philanthropically and you know government generosity we can think of ourselves being part of that as opposed to much you know our clan or uh race or Nation yeah I think on a global level it requires what you were saying and on a personal level it requires us to almost be able to evaluate assimilate assess you know have have self-awareness allow for self-reflection space for you know the things we don't have time for anymore you know I was uh looking into something called the third space Theory and how in the past you had your home you had work and then you had church or Temple or Community Center and how those three spaces that third space was a place you could look back on home and work and say I could treat my wife a little bit better or I could have spoken to my colleague a bit better and that third space allowed that time and energy where it was all about reflecting on how you could improve but today we've lost three spaces into two into one where we work from home live at home and the screen is our third space and so that lack of having a physical body or building that gives you permission to step back from your whole life not play a role there and and actually purvey what's going on in your life we've lost that yeah that's a shame uh you know the decline of religion is a a very strong Trend you'd hope there'd be a modern religion that takes whatever is put people off and yet preserves kind of this Golden Rule and this okay at a local community level we're supposed to help each other if you expect government to figure out how to solve things you know it's too bureaucratic the local church-based groups oh this person needs help I have extra time you know is way more effective and so we expect too much from government in a way so I hope we can re-energize you know perhaps through a type of religious modernization or maybe just a community thing that is maybe spiritual but not not uh labeled as as religion that local engagement where you see other people that I think we need more of it absolutely absolutely Bill I've got you for a couple more moments and uh there's a few things I wanted to ask you one was you talked about how in the book how being the smartest person in the room and that status was something that you may be hid behind and and your insecurities were hidden behind and I was wondering is that something that you've been able to put down that God and and take that away as time has moved on how how were you able to do that yeah I've mellowed a little bit uh you know to learn how to work with people who are intelligent in different ways you know Microsoft I had to get marketing salese at the foundation you know people who go out in the field and do heroic work and so my you know sort of single view of okay math cap capacity is you know this this great thing I've I've mellowed and you know been able to bring in different skill sets but no I I I started off being pretty bad at that what were those insecurities that you were hiding well you you tend to manage other people the way you manage yourself and so when I make a mistake in programming or math I'm very tough on myself and you know I'm like you need to spend more time you need to work harder and it's kind of a tough love don't fool yourself uh thing and so my early management style worked for people like me but not as well for other people and so year by year you know I did grow with Microsoft a lot of entrepreneurs you know don't stay as as CEO and you have to bring in someone else I wanted to do that and so by bringing in some other people I got better at that I would say moving over to the foundation was another level of how you you bring in uh different mix of talent and so yeah I'm trying I'm still trying I I I'll be better a year from now well I was most excited that you said there's still two more books coming after this one to talk about the different areas of your life and I I really enjoyed this one so much I'm so excited for people to read it to to get to know you better to get to know the people that have changed your life for the better and allow you to do all the incredible phen Al work you do today and I I honestly am so inspired by the work you do today and I I really hope that I can uh be involved in some small way so I thank you deeply well thank you it's been fantastic means the world Bill we we end every episode with a final five these questions have to be asked in answered in one word to one sentence maximum uh so Bill Gates these are your final five the first question is what is the best advice you've ever heard or received you know Finding what you really enjoy doing uh and hopefully there's some job that that has that uh as opposed to you know what jobs pay well or other people push you to if you're doing something you really enjoy that's hard to beat and you found that early oh I was super lucky on on that you know computers were there uh right when I needed them uh second question what is the worst advice you've ever heard or received people will tell you not to take risks and it's very well-intentioned uh but there are contexts you know when you're young you know like people say okay it must have been scary to drop out not really I mean I could have gone back you know there's no Flesh Wounds involved uh in in Failure you know so failure's you know probably a better teacher and and more of an okay thing and I think this whole safety thing physical safety you know emotional safety and many cases that we we've gone too far yeah did but did dropping out that at that time feel like a big risk no it didn't even the first time I felt it was when I was hiring people who Moved their family and they had kids and I was like if I can't pay this guy's check this is rude you know he's got a real problem and I'm kind of implicitly promising him I've got this thing figured out uh so that scared me yeah was that there's a scene in The Social Network where you're on stage p and Mark Zuckerberg's in your in the auditorium and then they leave and they say the speaker just said the next Bill Gates could be sitting in this room and then Mark goes that is Bill Gates is that true that is absolutely true Mark and I have laughed about that a lot that our experience at Harvard dropping out of Harvard you know telling people that hey we saw something other people didn't see uh very very similar uh question number three what would you say is the most important problem the smartest people on the planet should be solving right now there's many candidates you know making sure we don't use nuclear weapons avoid biot terrorism climate change caring for the poorest which we're kind of losing that but I would say shaping AI has for me uh risen to the the top of that list I we need to do all those we can't just skip you know the any of those but this one is is going to be a very big deal in in in the next decade and what would be your advice to the biggest Business Leaders in the world in regard to that well I don't think you can count on them their competitive framework is to go full speed and so only government's in a position to say wait a minute slowed down you know for the good stuff you want them to lower the price and get it done sooner and so we can't although yes they should be part of the dialogue and they're humans and citizens too but you can't count on them because the metric for them is to go full speed question number four what is your favorite mental health habit you know it's a very big deal for me to get time reading and and thinking by myself whether it's on a walk or going driving when I was CEO of Microsoft I took two full weeks think weeks one every six months where I would just go off by myself uh and think okay is Microsoft on track what are the trends towards the end I'd write a memo which actually uh was kind of valuable as we navigated the twists and turns like when the internet comes along or you know software is not reliable enough you know I need that time to think even though I love quick thinking you know being in a meeting and spotting a mistake most of my good work come from the kind of slow thinking where I'm off being reflective and maybe coming up with some nonobvious ideas you know maybe it's a little bit my you know being on the Spectrum I I need that that refreshment you know when I I see my schedule with lots of social interaction for a week then I'll try and make sure the next week has a little bit less of that but you know to maintain creativity you have to have some calmness and be not behind if you feel like you're behind like you turn on your email like ah uh oh I'm late uh you know that that your creativity gets get squeezed out one one of the first things and does that think we need to be in nature are you away from everything is it are you simply thinking are you taking books are you journaling or is it I'm taking books to read but I'm also taking very long walks um on your own and just thinking about things and I love I take a tablet of paper and write things down quite a bit and you know I'm I'm pretty religious I'm not taking phone calls I'm not browsing the news you know the news can wait you know I'm off by myself 20 24 hours that whole time uh somebody can stick some food in uh but uh and and you know that's kind of extreme you know there's people like Harari who meditate kind of an unbelievable I almost Envy uh him I don't think I would go that far but we should be more in his Direction than we are yeah absolutely uh and what what's the book you've gifted most actually I'm intrigued because you're such a big reader you recommend so many great books what's the book you've gifted to people close to you the most there's a Stephen Pinker book called better angel of our nature uh that talks about even though in the short run we see how tough things are if we zoom out a little bit and say okay 200 years ago to be a woman to be gay you know 30% of child children die you know lifespan uh is less than 50 years you know that's not saying there's a guarantee that those bad things we talked about won't happen but people are a little overwrought and saying okay you know this a approach to government is failing maybe we should try something radical like not you know being fully Democratic I'm like whoa whoa wait a minute here yes we need to feel bad about the the the things we're not doing but we also need to have a perspective the the system of scientific inquiry and democracy and widening our Circle of Care you know beyond our our family Clan Nation as as we discover new things and we can share more resources that really is working you know it sounds uh naive uh to say that but you know the books that really go through that uh I I find you know guide how I think about the world absolutely uh Fifth and final question if you could create one law that everyone in the world had to follow what would it be well if you look at all these religious texts you know I'd say the the thing they all eventually come back to is is the Golden Rule which is to treat people how you would like to be treated you know I mean say that you're about to be born and you don't know if you're going to be born a woman or an Africa this is a a thing that Warren Buffett taught me you know what you get to construct the world and how fair it is and then you we will randomly pick and you will be born in some place in some way and you know I think the construct that would guide the world you'd want for that is is very much going back to that Golden Rule not okay let's win Wars you know let's out compete or you know have have more money or resources than than other people and so it's kind of a it's one of the few Universal truths that um we we should have that guide our Behavior I love that bill thank you so much for your time on on purpose today and genuinely so grateful for your time and energy it was thrilling to talk to you and I love getting an early copy of the book and being ah head of the world on it so thank you so much well you know i' I've loved our conversation so look forward to more thank you if you enjoyed this podcast you're going to love my conversation with Michelle Obama where she opens up on how to stay with your partner when they're changing and the four check-ins you should be doing in your relationship we all also talk about how to deal with relationships when they're under stress if you're going through something right now with your partner or someone you're seeing this is the episode for you no wonder our kids are struggling we have a new technology and we've just taken it in hookline and sinker and we have to be mindful for our kids they'll just be thumbing through this stuff you know their their minds never sleeping"

      "transcript": "[Music] so what did your family think did they say there's something wrong with this young man he wants to just do computers that was kind of considered a little strange have you ever thought how your life could be better off if you had gotten your Harvard degree I'm a weird Dropout because I take college courses all the time what about Steve Jobs in those days what was your relationship with him we were both there at the very beginning you're the wealthiest man in the world for 20 years or more is that more of a burden than a pleasure to be the wealthiest man in the world would you fix your tith please well people wouldn't recognize me if my tie was fixed but okay just leave it this way all [Music] right I don't consider myself a journalist and nobody else would consider myself a journalist I began to take on the life of being an interviewer even though I have a day job of running a private Equity Firm how do you define leadership what is it that makes somebody tick you built one of the great technology companies in the world and one of the great companies in the world and now you're building and operating one of the great uh foundations in the world how do you compare the challenge of building Microsoft to the challenge of now running the bill in Melinda Gates Foundation I think they have more in common than people might expect you know the idea that you find what an innovation is going to be really stick to it build a team behind that uh have some setbacks and success is a you know kind of a theory of change now my Microsoft work was when I was very young I started when I was uh 17 and that was my primary focus until I was 53 when I made the transition and for the early part of that I was kind of maniacal I wasn't married no kids I didn't believe in weekends until I was about 30 I didn't believe in in vacations at all so it was incredibly fulfilling to write the code and be Hands-On you know stay up all night so for my 20s and 30s I think the Microsoft thing was perfect uh I didn't have the breadth of knowledge uh that would let me uh play my role at the foundation I think it was a good preparation and then after I you know met Melinda got married started having kids I was looking at the world more broadly thinking about where the wealth should go and I'd say they're equally difficult you always know you could be doing better that you should learn more that uh you know getting building the team and uh thinking about things in a in a better way so you see the positive results but you always want to do even better and so let's talk about Microsoft for a moment so you started that when you were in high school and you were driven to be involved with computers were you alone were that many people knew about computers in those days was a fairly special time because computers when I was young were super expensive and my friend Paul Allen and I actually snuck into places at the University of Washington where they had computers that weren't being used at night and so we were fascinated by what the computer could do but very few people were getting exposure we had to go out of our way and we were lucky that we did it all and so then when the idea of moving the computer onto a chip that Intel would make and it would make the computer literally millions of times cheaper than the ones we were using so both more powerful and available to people on a personal level then the idea of okay it would be very different the software you needed the way the industry would work we were super lucky to uh be there when that was happening so what did your family think did they say there's something wrong with this young man he wants to just do computers they knew I was obsessed with computers that I would skip Athletics that I'd go in overnight that I'd you know leave the house sometimes when they prefer I wouldn't go work at night on these things and so I was kind of considered a little strange and the big moment was when I said instead of going to part of my senior year that I wanted to go work uh for company writing software so they were great about allowing that to be my hobby so you went to Harvard and you dropped out have you ever thought how your life could be better off if you had gotten your Harvard degree well I'm I'm a weird Dropout because I take college courses all the time I love uh Learning Company courses and and things so I loved being a student and there were smart people around and you know they fed you and they gave you these nice grades that made you feel smart uh so I I feel it was unfortunate uh that I didn't get to stay there but I don't think I missed any knowledge because you know whatever I needed to learn I would I was still in a a learning mode so in the early days um you know you were just a College Dropout you were very youngl looking did you get taken seriously by businessmen who are much older for some people that youth uh and geekiness uh was like hey should we trust them you know that's so weird we've never seen something like that before so yes we had to fight for acceptance I couldn't rent cars uh so I had to take cabs around because I was too young and you know probably some people were a little tough but then as as we got a little bit of success people were fascinated by this deep belief we had in in software okay so when Microsoft is moving forward you decided to take the company public in 19 um 86 six and at that point you are a billionaire uh I'm pretty close to it uh within a year of going public I think uh there's some Fortune cover that says the deal that made Bill Gates 360 million or some weird thing like that right how did it change your life or it didn't change your life at all well that whole period of time was amazing because I was hiring people as fast as I could I brought in Steve Balmer who was very good at that and and he was helping out you know we had a sense of urgency that we wanted to lead the way there was this Graphics interface thing with windows that we wanted to do so I was super busy and the idea that I could hire so quickly and invest and build this worldwide company it was fascinating me but I was really busy so you know if some friend had tried to call me uh you know I I wouldn't have had too much time for that I was really into building this company and I was going out and telling people about the magic of software which was good for Microsoft but also helping them understand the opportunities and the huge change agent that software and eventually software plus the internet would would become so I was having fun it was amazing but I always thought hey you know we're one step away from not you know leading here we got to got to keep doing better when you had the famous IBM contract you won the contract to produce their operating system why did they let you in effect own it and and they had to license it was that a mistake on their part yeah this is before Graphics interface when you still just have text on the screen and so the software MS DOS was a key thing so it got to be more of a high-end machine including this Ms Doss they didn't see how big this machine would be and they their legal department didn't want to uh take responsibility for the source code they had a fairly limited license and that we understood that this was a seminal machine and other people would do similar machines so that was fairly advantageous to us they didn't see the values being in the software they thought that the hardware was the key and software was just a sort of necessary thing so if they had realized the vision we had which was that software over time would be way more important than Hardware they would have negotiated probably a different deal you have a fair amount of money for anybody your age at that time certainly did you say I'll go splurge and buy a nice car I'll buy an airplane I'll buy a boat or you just didn't really care about that I bought one thing that was a tiny bit of a Splurge was was that my first car that I owned was a Porsche 911 it was used uh but it was an incredible car and that was actually when I was down in Albuquerque and sometimes when I would want to think at night I'd just go out and drive around it at high speed fortunately I I didn't kill myself doing that that and what about Steve Jobs in those days um what was your relationship with him uh in the early days and how did it change well we were both there at the very beginning uh the apple one was a kick computer that Steve wnc uh designed and he worked with Steve and they came and offered it at various of these Computer Club meetings and we went to lots of Computer Club meetings so we were sort of colleagues in pitching the gospel of uh personal Computing we were kind of competitors the the time we worked together most intensely was after the IBM PC came out Steve had a group actually a small group at Apple that was doing the Macintosh and he came to us early on and asked us if we'd commit resources we actually put more people on the project than Apple did and did uh the early application software that used that Mouse uh Graphics interface and so it was a huge win both for Microsoft and for Apple when the Macintosh became so successful when your mother first said I'd like you to come and have dinner uh with me and Warren Buffet will be here you should meet him you didn't seem that interested why was that well Warren I thought of was somebody who bought and sold Securities which is a very zero some thing that's not curing disease or a cool piece of software and the idea of you know kind of looking at volume curves and that's why it was so shocking when I met him [Music] so your company grows it becomes successful becomes the most valuable company in the world at one point at what point do you say I've made a fair amount of money I don't need to do this anymore I want to do something else with my life 1995 is a big year where we ship a product conveniently called Windows 95 and our softare was doing well and we emerge we we had always had the greatest depth of engineering and we were slightly the biggest but we really emerg as the successful company and um and so I started thinking about wow you know there's a lot of value here at Microsoft what have other philanthropists done historically so during the 90s I'm thinking about that uh my mom tragically passes away in the same years as I get married in 1994 my dad is volunteering to help out think about the philanthropy piece so it was in the year 2000 that I put2 billion uh into the foundation and you know then it became the the biggest Foundation at that point you mentioned you got married in 1994 you married a Duke graduate um how did you have time to um woo somebody when you're running your company and how how much time did that take well she was an employee of microsof roft and we' run into each other actually New York City city we ended up sitting together in a dinner and uh you know she's an amazing person and you know kind of caught me by surprise how much uh that engaged my attention even versus all this exciting Microsoft stuff I was doing so we you know dated on and off for about 5 years and then uh decided uh to get married so so you have decided that your foundation would focus principally but other things as well but principally on Health in Africa and kada 12 education United States is that right yeah health for of all the poorest but Africa's paradigmatic so how did you come to those conclusions that those were the two things you wanted to work on as opposed to everything else we talked about it a lot so that's the decision that Melinda and I made we wanted to take the greatest Injustice in the world something that we could make a h uge difference in and that's Health now we broaden that a bit by doing Agriculture and sanitation and some other things and then we wanted to take a cause that would help the US uh be as strong as it could and in that case trying to help improve Educational Opportunity is our big thing you and Melinda go into the field why do you feel you need to go into the field in Africa or or Latin America any part of the world where you're giving away money and actually meet people that you're giving money to and learn well I've chosen to spend my time and Melinda spends her time building the foundation as an institution that really has an impact and I get a lot of enjoyment this is you know how I've taken everything I've learned from Microsoft and the position I'm in and helping to drive the strategy and go out and and see what's going on with this work that's my full-time job and it's a a wonderful job your foundation has a certain life it's not a Perpetual Foundation is it uh I think it's a 20 years after either you or your wife the last one to live dies that it would end is that how it works that's right the way that we're managing the institution and keeping it excellent and designing it to solve problems that can be totally solved so we work on malaria uh this Foundation should be able to participate in getting rid of that all these infectious diseases that so disproportionately hurt the poor and really explain most the difference between why a poor child has a 50 times greater chance of dying than a child in uh a wealthy country in 30 or 40 years uh those problems should have been brought to an end and whatever the new problems philanthropy should go after the people who were alive then and and picking great Executives and building institutions to go solve they'll do a much better job than than we can just writing down a little guidance so it it is a limited time uh foundation so the way he lets there be a dialogue when your mother first said I'd like you to come and have dinner uh with me and Warren Buffet will be here you should meet him you didn't seem that interested why was that well Warren I thought of somebody who bought and sold Securities which is a very Zero Sum thing that's not disease or a cool piece of software and the idea of you know kind of looking at volume curves and it doesn't invent anything and so I thought my way of looking at the world what I wanted to figure out and do and what he looked at that there wouldn't be much intersection and that's why it was so shocking when I met him he was the first person to really ask me about software and software pricing and why wasn't IBM with all of their strength able to over well Microsoft and what what was going to happen in terms of how software would change the world and you know he let me ask him about okay well why do you invest in certain industries and why are some banks more profit than others and he he was clearly a broad systems thinker and so it started a conversation that has been fun and enriching and uh you know an incredible friendship that was completely unexpected and he taught you how to play bridge or did you already know I knew how to play bridge but I had done it just our family had done it and then uh because Warren it was a chance to spend time with Warren I renewed my bridge skill at first very poorly but uh both Golf and Bridge uh were things that we did uh in our our hours that we got to goof off together you given up on golf well Warren uh gave up on golf a few years ago and so my primary excuse to play golf has gone away so I'm I'm golfing not much now uh tennis is is become my my primary sport Warren Buffett called you one day and said by the way I'm going to give you most of my money were you surprised when he said he wanted to give you all this money from his wealth to your foundation that was a a complete surprise because Warren uh is the best investor and he's built this unbelievable company and he was giving me advice about all the things I was doing I was learning so much from him but his wealth was devoted to a foundation that his wife uh was in charge of and so tragically she passed away uh and so then he had to think that his his initial plan wouldn't make sense and and much to my surprise he decided that a part of the wealth uh a little over 80% of it would come uh to our foundation so it was a huge honor a hugee responsibility you know an incredible thing because it let us raise our level of ambition even beyond what we would have done without that that you know in in by most definitions the most generous gift of all time and you started with Warren and Melinda the giving pledge uh what is that about and how has that worked well Warren was brainstorming with us about how did philanthropists figure out what to do and uh what how could they kind of help share with each other without uh uh giving up the diversity what they did and so he got us to do some dinners with people who are already doing amazing philanthropy and talk about uh how they built staff and picked causes and not that they would give to the same things but that they would uh the quality and even the the how early people get engaged would be enhanced by the people getting together and making a a public commitment to give the majority of their wealth away and so uh that's become the giving pledge group you're the wealthiest man in the world for 20 years or more how does it affect your life daily people come up to you all the time and ask for money or they expect you to buy them things you gotten tired of it [Music] when you were doing Microsoft at the beginning you were doing the coding yourself and uh you could presumably know more than about coding than just about anybody but now that you have so many other responsibilities when Microsoft develops a new piece of software are you able to really talk to the software engineers in the same level that you could 20 years ago well I'm certainly nowhere near as Hands-On as I was when I would either write the code or look it over and hire all the programmers and in my career this evolution of of being an individual performer then a manager manager managers and then setting broad strategy you have to get used to the fact you don't have as much control but I try and understand enough about software that the trade-offs were're making about what feature should we put in what the basic design should be uh I still enjoy those discussions and even today over at Microsoft uh we get to talk about okay what should the next office do uh you know how can Windows be better how's the user interface going to change when we have speech and handwriting and those things so I'm able to participate but it is a way more complex field and uh you know I couldn't actually write all the code my myself anymore when somebody turns on their computer today they have to have three three fingers usually and they put a finger on control alt and delete and it seems a little awkward to do that uh why did you do that and why did people have to have that mechanism to turn on the computer well fortunately most machines nowadays have moved away from that but the idea that we knew that that there was logic in the keyboard that could detect a truly unique sing signal that would bypass the software that was running so you could know it was really starting over clearly that ended up being uh an awkward piece of user interface if we had to do it over again we wouldn't do it uh it sort of was in the chasm between Microsoft and IBM that it ended up being that way um and you know it's kind of become the poster child of hey couldn't you have made this stuff a little simpler we love we love so you're the wealthiest man in the world for 20 years or more how did it affect your life daily people come up to you all the time and ask for money or they expect you to buy them things fortunately people know that that wealth is dedicated to the foundation and so if they have ideas that are in the foundation's area infectious disease improving education then it's super interesting uh to have them talk to me or talk to those people I have the the benefit of being well known so I can go out and meet interesting people and you know uh Share My Views and get uh a lot of attention I'd say net that's a benefit when I'm out with the kids then it can be you know a tiny bit of a drawback that you you may not get as much privacy as you'd like but overall it you know I I I I My Success has allowed me to you know get more done build Partnerships you know meet great people how do you deal with it when you want to go shopping or you don't don't go to shopping I go shop I go out to the theater uh people don't come up to you time for selfies or something they can yeah but that's that's pretty quick uh and people are usually very nice about it what about your children everybody who's wealthy who has children has to deal with how do you train your children to live with the wealth how much do you give them and how do you get them involved in philanthropy well our kids are young enough that the key focus is helping them you know enjoy learning uh get a great education all of will pick careers that aren't related to software philanthropy they will strike out in their own Direction and be great you know in their own way whatever it is they pick to do so uh We've chosen that they'll have enough wealth that they'll never uh be poor anything but we're not going to take billions of dollars and have that Define their life the the vast majority of the wealth is dedicated to the the foundation and so far you know they're they're great kids and uh you know they they enjoy learning about what we're doing in Africa and you know that may shape where where they go at their lives but it'll be up to them when people look back on what you've done 20 years from now 30 years from now what would you like to have people say Bill Gates achieved well I don't think it's important for me to be remembered specifically I do hope that infectious disease is largely eliminated as a problem so that nobody's having to talk about it and people can focus on other issues that would be a huge great thing if our work has helped improve us education uh that would be a huge great thing you know most
