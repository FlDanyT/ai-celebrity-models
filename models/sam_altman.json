      "transcript": "Andrew Mayne: Welcome to the OpenAI podcast. Andrew Mayne: My name is Andrew Mayne. Andrew Mayne: For several years, I worked at OpenAI first as an engineer on the applied team and then as the science communicator. Andrew Mayne: After that, I worked with companies and individuals trying to figure out how to incorporate artificial intelligence. Andrew Mayne: With this podcast, we have the opportunity to talk to the people working with and at OpenAI about what's going on behind the scenes and maybe get a glimpse of the future. Andrew Mayne: My first guest is Sam Altman, CEO and co-founder of OpenAI. Andrew Mayne: And we're gonna find out a bit more about Stargate, how he uses ChatGPT as a parent, and maybe get an idea of when GPT-5 is coming. Sam Altman: More and more people will think we've gotten to an AGI system every year. Sam Altman: What you want out of hardware and software is changing quite rapidly. Sam Altman: But if people knew what we could do with more compute, they would want way, way more. Andrew Mayne: One of my friends is a new parent and is using ChatGPT a lot to ask questions. Andrew Mayne: It's become a very good resource. Andrew Mayne: And you are a new parent. Andrew Mayne: And how much has ChatGPT been helping you with that? Sam Altman: A lot. Sam Altman: I mean, clearly people have been able to take care of babies without ChatGPT for a long time. I don't know how I would have done that. Sam Altman: Those first few weeks, it was like every I mean, constantly. Sam Altman: Now I now I kinda ask it questions about like developmental stages more because Andrew Mayne: I can Sam Altman: I can do the basics, but Andrew Mayne: Is this normal? Sam Altman: Yeah. Sam Altman: But it was super helpful for that. Sam Altman: I spend a lot of time thinking about how my kid will use AI in in the future. Sam Altman: It it is sort of like, by the way, extremely kid-pilled. Sam Altman: I think everybody should have a lot of kids. Andrew Mayne: Yeah. Andrew Mayne: A lot of my friends at OpenAI, former colleagues and current ones, are having kids. Andrew Mayne: And people go like, oh, what about this AI thing? Andrew Mayne: Everyone I know inside is very optimistic in having families. Sam Altman: I think that's a good sign. Sam Altman: Yeah. Sam Altman: Like, my kids will never be smarter than AI. Sam Altman: But also they will grow up. Andrew Mayne: Way to set them back Sam Altman: there though. Sam Altman: I mean, they will grow up like vastly more capable than we grew up and able to do things that would just, we cannot imagine. Sam Altman: And they'll be really good at using AI. Sam Altman: And obviously, think about that a lot, but I I think much more about the, like, what they will have that we didn't than what is gonna be taken away. Sam Altman: They're like, I don't don't think my kids will ever be bothered by the fact that they're not smarter than AI. Sam Altman: I just like, you know, I there's this video that always has stuck with me of a baby or like a little toddler with one of those old glossy magazines going like this on the screen. Andrew Mayne: Because it thinks it's an iPad. Andrew Mayne: Thought it was Sam Altman: a broken iPad. Sam Altman: Yeah. Sam Altman: And, you know, kids born now will just think the world always had extremely smart AI. Sam Altman: And they will use it incredibly naturally and they will look back at this as like a very, you know, prehistoric time period. Andrew Mayne: I saw something on social media where a guy talked about he got tired of talking to his kid about Thomas the Tank Engine. Andrew Mayne: So he put it into ChatGPT into voice mode. Sam Altman: Kids love voice mode Andrew Mayne: in ChatGPT. Andrew Mayne: And he was like an hour later, the kid's still talking about Thomas the train. Sam Altman: Again, I suspect there this is not all gonna be good. Sam Altman: There will be problems. Sam Altman: People will develop Andrew Mayne: Yeah. Sam Altman: These sort of somewhat problematic or maybe very problematic parasocial relationships and, well, society will have to figure out new guardrails and but the upsides will be tremendous. Sam Altman: And we society in general is good at figuring out how to mitigate the downsides. Andrew Mayne: Yeah. Andrew Mayne: So, yeah, I think optimistic. Andrew Mayne: We're seeing some interesting data where used along in classrooms with a good teacher, good curriculum, ChatGPT becomes very good, used solely by itself as sort of a homework crutch can lead to kids sort of just doing the same thing as trying to Google stuff. Sam Altman: I was one of those kids that everyone's worried I was just gonna Google everything when it came out and stopped learning. Sam Altman: You know, it turns out, like, relatively quickly, kids in schools adapt. Sam Altman: So Yeah. Sam Altman: I think we'll figure this out. Andrew Mayne: Think of what you could have become if you didn't Google everything, Sam. Andrew Mayne: You know? Andrew Mayne: So we've seen this adoption figures, are really insane. Andrew Mayne: It's OpenAI's most popular product. Andrew Mayne: Five years from now, is it gonna be ChatGPT? Sam Altman: I mean, I think ChatGPT will just be a totally different thing five years from now. Sam Altman: So in some sense, no. Sam Altman: But will it still be called ChatGPT? Sam Altman: Probably. Andrew Mayne: Yeah. Andrew Mayne: Okay. Andrew Mayne: So it's a solid name. Andrew Mayne: So the other thing we hear is AGI, which I'd like to hear your definition of AGI. Sam Altman: In many senses, if you asked me or anybody else to propose a definition of AGI five years ago based off, like, the cognitive capabilities of software. Sam Altman: I think the definition many people would would have given then is now, like, well surpassed. Sam Altman: Like, these models are smart now. Andrew Mayne: Right. Sam Altman: And they'll keep getting smarter. Sam Altman: They'll keep improving. Sam Altman: I think more and more people will think we've gotten to an AGI system every year. Sam Altman: Even though the definition will keep pushing out and getting more ambitious, like, more people will still agree to it. Sam Altman: But, you know, we have systems now that are really increasing people's productivity that are able to do valuable economic work. Sam Altman: Maybe a better question is what will it take for something I would call superintelligence? Andrew Mayne: Okay. Sam Altman: If we had a system that was capable of either doing autonomous discovery of new science or greatly increasing the capability of people using the tool to discover new science, that would feel like kind of almost definitionally superintelligence to me and be a wonderful thing for the world, I think. Andrew Mayne: So, basically, a lot of it's kind of this gradient where it keeps getting better and better in each one of our definitions. I felt like that way when we hit GPT-4 internally playing at this, this, I'm like, there's ten years of runway that we can do so much stuff with this. Andrew Mayne: And even when it starts using itself, like, can enter reasoning was really capable. Andrew Mayne: But when you're saying it comes up with some new theorem or proof or something, and then, oh, hey. Andrew Mayne: We found a better cure for cancer, or I found out some new GLP drug or something. Sam Altman: Yeah. Sam Altman: I mean, I I am a big believer that the high order bit of people's lives getting better is more scientific progress. Sam Altman: Mhmm. Sam Altman: That is kind of that is kind of what what limits us. Sam Altman: And so if we can discover much more, I I think that really will have a a very significant impact. Sam Altman: And for me, that would just be, like, a tremendously exciting milestone. Sam Altman: I think many other great uses of AI will happen too, but that one feels really important. Andrew Mayne: Have you seen, like, signs of this you'd see internally? Andrew Mayne: Have you seen things that made you go, oh, I think we've kind of figured it out? Sam Altman: Nothing where I would say we have figured it out, but I would say increasing confidence on the directions to pursue. Sam Altman: Maybe the I mean, this is the example everyone talks about, but I think it it is still interesting. Sam Altman: What's happening with people using AI systems to write code and coders being much more productive and thus researchers as well? Sam Altman: Like, that is a sort of example of, okay. Sam Altman: It's obviously not doing new science, but it is definitely making scientists able to do their work faster. Sam Altman: We hear this with o3 all the time from scientists as well. Sam Altman: So I wouldn't say we figured it out. Sam Altman: I wouldn't say we we know the algorithm where we're just like, alright. Sam Altman: We can point this thing, and it'll go do science on its own. Sam Altman: But we're getting good guesses, and the rate of progress is continuing to just be, like, super impressive. Sam Altman: Watching the progress from o1 to o3 where it was like every couple of weeks, the team was just like, we have a major new idea, and they all kept working. Sam Altman: It was a reminder of sometimes when you, like, discover a big new insight, things can go surprisingly fast, and I'm sure we'll see that many more times. Andrew Mayne: I noticed recently OpenAI had just shifted the model in Operator to o3. Andrew Mayne: And I noticed a big improvement Sam Altman: Way better. Andrew Mayne: With operator. Andrew Mayne: It and I'd I'd say that the thing that we ran into before was brittleness, is that you have people who promise agentic systems, can do all these things, but the moment it gets to a problem it can't solve, it falls apart. Sam Altman: Interestingly, speaking of the AGI question, a lot of people have told me that their personal moment was operator with o three, and there's something about watching an AI use a computer pretty well. Sam Altman: Not perfectly, but it's not. Sam Altman: It's o3 was a big step forward that feels very AGI like. Sam Altman: It didn't it didn't really have that effect on me to the same degree, although it's it's quite impressive, but I I've heard that enough times. Andrew Mayne: Mine was with Deep Research because that felt like a really agentic use of it. Andrew Mayne: And that was when I came back and it produced something on a topic because I had been interested in that was better than I read before because previously all those models would just get a bunch of sources, summarize it. Andrew Mayne: But when I watched the system go out on the Internet, get data Yeah. Andrew Mayne: Follow that, then follow that lead, and then follow back, then come back, like I would've, but better, was interesting. Sam Altman: I met this guy recently. Sam Altman: He's like a one of these, like, crazy autodidacts, just obsessed with learning and knows about everything. Sam Altman: And he uses Deep Research to produce a report on anything he's curious about and then just sits there all day and has gotten good at digesting them fast and know what to ask next. Sam Altman: And it is like, it is an amazing new tool for people who really have a crazy appetite to learn. Andrew Mayne: I built my own app that literally lets me ask questions and it generates audio files for me of this stuff because it's just like that. Andrew Mayne: My curiosity probably exceeds my retention. Andrew Mayne: And Operator, I'll tell you the magical moment for me, and I'm curious see where the thing's going next, was I was doing a thing on Marshall McLuhan, and I wanted to get a bunch of images of Marshall McLuhan, and I asked her to do it. Andrew Mayne: And then all of a sudden, I had a whole folder full of these things, was, for a research thing, would have taken me forever to do. Sam Altman: Yeah. Sam Altman: I think we're just gonna keep seeing things like this where whatever we thought about what a workflow had to be like and how long something had to take is gonna just change, like, wildly fast. Andrew Mayne: Yeah. Andrew Mayne: How are you using it? Andrew Mayne: Deep Research? Sam Altman: Yeah. Sam Altman: Science that I'm curious about? Sam Altman: I'm I'm just in this, like, weird place of I am extremely time strapped. Sam Altman: If I had more time, I would read like, I would read Deep Research reports preferentially to reading most other things, but I'm sort of short on time to read in general. Sam Altman: Yeah. Andrew Mayne: What's neat too is the sharing feature, which I love because now it's easy to share that with somebody else. Andrew Mayne: The PDFs are great, and that's cool. Andrew Mayne: And I would say that even though we have deep research, we have these tools, there is a model race going on. Andrew Mayne: And so the question comes up is like GPT-5. Andrew Mayne: And any idea is that with a system like that, we should see an increase in capabilities. Andrew Mayne: What is the time frame for GPT-five? Andrew Mayne: When are we gonna see this? Sam Altman: Probably sometime this summer. Sam Altman: Right. Sam Altman: I don't know exactly when. Sam Altman: One thing that we go back and forth on is how much are we supposed to, like, turn up the big number on new models versus what we did with GPT-4o, which is just better and better and better and Andrew Mayne: I had to handle the release of GPT-4, right, when that was coming out. Andrew Mayne: And meanwhile, I had to kinda do this take test off between that and 3.5. Andrew Mayne: And 3.5 kept getting better and better and better. Andrew Mayne: And the comparisons I was able to make were changing. Andrew Mayne: And so that's my question. Andrew Mayne: It's like, yeah, that, you know, like, would I know GPT-5 versus, wow, this is a really good GPT-4.5? Sam Altman: Not necessarily. Sam Altman: I mean, it, like, it could go either way. Sam Altman: Right? Sam Altman: You could just, like, keep doing iterations of 4.5 or at some point you could call it five. Sam Altman: It used to be much clearer. Sam Altman: We would train a model and put it out, and then we would train a new big model and put it out. Sam Altman: And, you know, now the systems have gotten much more complex, and we can continually post train them to make them better. Sam Altman: I were thinking about this right now. Sam Altman: Like, every time let's say we launch GPT-5, and then we update it and update it and update it. Sam Altman: Should we just keep calling those GPT-5? Sam Altman: Like, we do with GPT-4o, or should we call those 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 so you know which you know when the version changes? Sam Altman: I don't think we have an answer to this yet, but but I think there is something better to do than the way we handled it with 4o. Sam Altman: We we see this periodically. Sam Altman: Like, sometimes people like one snapshot much better than another, and they might wanna keep using one. Sam Altman: We we gotta gotta figure something out here. Andrew Mayne: Yeah. Andrew Mayne: The challenge is even if you're technically inclined, you can kind of understand, okay, if there's an o before it, I know this. Andrew Mayne: But if I want, know, like but then even then it's not clear, should I use o4-mini? Andrew Mayne: Should I use o3? Andrew Mayne: Should I use this? Sam Altman: I think this was like an example of this was an artifact of shifting paradigms. Andrew Mayne: Mhmm. Sam Altman: And then we kinda had these two things going at once. Sam Altman: I think we are near the end of this current problem, but I can imagine a world I don't know what it is, but I can imagine a world that we discover some new paradigm that again means we need to, like, bifurcate the model tree. Andrew Mayne: Okay. Andrew Mayne: Even more complicated names. Sam Altman: I hope we don't have to do that. Sam Altman: I am excited to just get to GPT-5 and GPT-6, and I think that'll be easier for people to use, and you won't have to think, do I want, you know, o4-mini-high or o3 or 4o Andrew Mayne: o4-mini-high is what I use to code. Andrew Mayne: Yeah. Andrew Mayne: I have a conversation, it's o3. Sam Altman: I think we will be out of that whole mess soon Yeah. Sam Altman: For now. Andrew Mayne: Yeah. Andrew Mayne: I mean, it's it's fun to have choice when you know what they mean, but it's it's still I think one of the things that's made these things more capable but also harder to understand where the capability is coming from is integrations of things like memory. Andrew Mayne: And memory started off as one very simple thing and now memory's got more sophisticated. Sam Altman: Memory is probably my favorite recent ChatGPT feature. Sam Altman: Mhmm. Sam Altman: You know, the first time you could talk to a computer, like GPT-3 or whatever, that felt like a really big deal. Sam Altman: And now that the computer I feel like it kind of, like, knows a lot of context on me. Sam Altman: And if I ask it a question with only a small number of words, it knows enough about the rest of my life to be pretty confident in what I want it to do. Sam Altman: Sometimes in ways I don't even think of. Sam Altman: Like, that has been a real surprising, like, level up. Sam Altman: So I and and I hear that from a lot of other people as well. Sam Altman: There are people who don't like it, but most people really do. Sam Altman: I think we are heading towards a world where if you want, the AI will just have, like, unbelievable context on your life and give you these super, super helpful answers. Andrew Mayne: Which I for me is cool. Andrew Mayne: The fact that you can turn it off is also great. Andrew Mayne: But one of the challenges came out was in New York Times ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI, they just asked the court to tell OpenAI they had to preserve consumer ChatGPT user records beyond the 30 day window that has to be held for regular reasons. Andrew Mayne: And Brad Lightcap just wrote a letter responding to this. Andrew Mayne: Could you explain? Sam Altman: We're gonna fight that, obviously, and I suspect, I hope, but I do think we we will win. Sam Altman: I think it was a crazy overreach of the New York Times to ask for that. Sam Altman: This is someone who says, you know, they value user privacy, whatever. Sam Altman: But I to, like, look for the silver lining here. Sam Altman: I hope this will be a moment where society realizes that privacy is really important. Sam Altman: Privacy needs to be a core principle of using AI. Sam Altman: You cannot have a company like The New York Times ask an AI provider to compromise user privacy, And I think society needs to I think it's really unfortunate The New York Times did that, but I hope this accelerates the conversation that society needs to have about how we're going to treat privacy and AI. Sam Altman: And I hope the answer is, like, we take it very, very seriously. Sam Altman: People are having quite private conversations with ChatGPT now. Sam Altman: ChatGPT will be a very sensitive source of information, and I think we need a framework that reflects that. Andrew Mayne: So that brings up the other question from people who are using this or skeptical is that OpenAI now has access to this data, and there's the concern one was about training, which OpenAI has been very clear about when or when not. Andrew Mayne: It's training. Andrew Mayne: You have the option to turn that off. Andrew Mayne: The other thing is, like, advertising, things like that. Andrew Mayne: What's OpenAI's approach towards that? Andrew Mayne: How are you gonna handle that responsibility? Sam Altman: We haven't done any advertising product yet. Sam Altman: I kind of I mean, I'm not totally against it. Sam Altman: I can point to areas where I like ads. Sam Altman: I think ads on Instagram, kinda cool. Sam Altman: I bought a bunch of stuff from them. Sam Altman: But I am like I think it'd be very hard to I mean, take a lot of care to get right. Sam Altman: Yeah. Sam Altman: People have a very high degree of trust in ChatGPT, which is interesting because like AI hallucinates. Sam Altman: It should be the tech that you don't trust that much. Andrew Mayne: My friends hallucinate too, I trust them too Sam Altman: People really Yeah. Sam Altman: Do. Sam Altman: But I think part of that is if you compare us to social media or, you know, web search or something, where you can kinda tell that you are being monetized and the company is trying to, like, deliver you good products and services, no doubt, but also to kind of, like, get you to click on ads or whatever. Sam Altman: Like, you know, how much how much do you believe that, like, you're getting the thing that that company actually thinks is the best content for you versus something that's also trying to, like, interact with the ads? Sam Altman: I think there's, like, there's a psychological thing there. Sam Altman: So, for example, I think if we started modifying the output, like the stream that comes back from the LLM. Sam Altman: In exchange for who is paying us more, that would feel really bad. Sam Altman: Yeah. Sam Altman: And I and I would hate that as a user. Sam Altman: I think that'd be like a trust destroying moment. Sam Altman: Maybe if we just said, hey, we're never gonna modify that stream, but, like, if you click on something in there that is gonna be what we'd show anyway, we'll, like, we'll get, like, a little bit of the transaction revenue, and it's a flat thing for everybody. Sam Altman: If if we, you know, have, like, a easy way to pay for it or something, maybe that could work. Sam Altman: Maybe there could be, like, ads outside the transaction stream. Sam Altman: Sorry, outside of the LLM stream that are still really great. Sam Altman: But the burden of proof there, think would have to be very high and it would have to feel like really useful to users and really clear that it was not messing with the LLM's output. Andrew Mayne: Yeah. Andrew Mayne: It's gonna be a difficult one. Andrew Mayne: I hope there's a solution. Andrew Mayne: I would love to do all my purchasing through ChatGPT or a really good chatbot because a lot of the times I feel like I'm not making the most informed decisions. Andrew Mayne: And so mitigating Sam Altman: Yeah. Sam Altman: No. Sam Altman: That's good if we can do it in some sort of really clear and aligned way, but I don't know. Sam Altman: Like, I love that we build good services. Sam Altman: People pay us for them. Sam Altman: It's like very clear. Sam Altman: It's a Andrew Mayne: Well, that's benefit. Andrew Mayne: That's like, I'd say the difference in models is like, I think Google builds great stuff. Andrew Mayne: I think the new Gemini 2.5 is a really good model. Andrew Mayne: I think they went from Sam Altman: It is a really good model. Andrew Mayne: Yeah. Andrew Mayne: They went from kinda like, and like, oh, man, these things are good. Andrew Mayne: But end of the day, Google is an ad tech company. Andrew Mayne: And that's the thing that always kind of, you know, I, you know, using their API and stuff is not as too concerned, although, but I do think about like, man, if I'm using their chatbot, that whatever, that is my thinking is that their where their incentives are aligned. Sam Altman: Google Search was an amazing product for a long time. Sam Altman: it does feel to me like it's degraded. Sam Altman: But, you know, there was like a time where there were lots of ads, but I still thought it was the best thing on the Internet. Sam Altman: I mean, I love Google search. Sam Altman: So I don't like, it's clearly possible to be a good ad driven company, but and I, like, respect a lot of things Google has done, but there are obviously issues too. Andrew Mayne: Yeah. Andrew Mayne: the Apple model, as an Apple user, I liked was I know paying a lot for my phone, but I know they're not trying to cram all these things in it. Andrew Mayne: They did iAds, which was, you know, not terribly effective, which probably showed you their heart was really not in it. Sam Altman: Their heart was really not in it. Andrew Mayne: Yeah. Andrew Mayne: So it's gonna be interesting. Andrew Mayne: I guess we just have to keep watching and seeing this and we start to think, man, know, ChatGPT is really pushing this. Andrew Mayne: I need to start wondering about this. Sam Altman: Anything we do, we obviously need to just be like crazy upfront and clear about. Andrew Mayne: So we had an issue, there was a model update and then the thing that happened was apparently the model was trying to be a little bit too pleasing, was trying to be a little bit too agreeable. Andrew Mayne: And that brings up the human AI interaction as people are using these systems more and developing these relationships with that. Andrew Mayne: Like, do you see the shape of that coming and what's OpenAI's position on personality? Sam Altman: One of the big mistakes of the social media era was the feed algorithms had a bunch of unintended negative consequences on society as a whole and maybe even individual users. Sam Altman: Although they were doing the thing that a user wanted or someone thought that user wanted in the moment, which is get them to, like, keep spending time on the site. Sam Altman: And that was the was the big misalignment of of social media. Sam Altman: And I think there were a lot of other things like, you know, making people upset kind of gets them stuck on more than being like happy and content. Sam Altman: And I always knew that there'd be like new problems in the world with AI. Sam Altman: Where the thing that, you know, there'd be like something that was, like, misaligned in a not obvious way. Sam Altman: But definitely one of the first ones that we experienced was if you ask a user what they for one given response versus and then you try to, like, build a model that is most helpful to the user. Sam Altman: And you show a user, say, two responses, which one's more helpful to you? Sam Altman: On any given thing, you might wanna model to behave one way, but over the course of, you know, all your interaction with an AI, that might not match up. Sam Altman: You know, you can see and we did see these problems where if you pay too much attention to the user signals and a lot of other things that we talked about in our our postmortem, but that I think this is just, an interesting one. Sam Altman: On the short horizon, you kind of don't get the behavior that the user most wants or is most helpful or useful or healthy to a user in the long run. Sam Altman: So, you know, maybe the analogy to filter bubbles is going to be AIs that are, you know, helpful to a user in a short amount horizon, but not over a long horizon. Andrew Mayne: Why, I think a sign of that was DALL-E 3, which I thought technically was a really capable model, but they all kinda started to be one kind of genre of image. Andrew Mayne: And and and all kinda like an HDR sort of style, and was that from doing that sort of comparisons where users said, looking in just these two things in isolation, I prefer this one better? Sam Altman: I don't remember for DALL-E 3, but I would assume so. Andrew Mayne: Yeah. Andrew Mayne: Which I think it's gotten better. Andrew Mayne: New image model is like The new image model is fantastic. Andrew Mayne: Crazy good. Andrew Mayne: Yeah. Andrew Mayne: Yeah. Andrew Mayne: And I can only imagine where that's gonna go from here. Andrew Mayne: So when you're building these things and you're increasing usage, and that's always been sort of a problem, the new image model comes out and you have to restrict usage and you have to have, like you have Sora, which you can only have a certain amount of compute to do that, illustrates the big problem everybody's facing, which is compute. Andrew Mayne: And so to address this, we heard about Project Stargate, which has a very cool name and it involves computers. Andrew Mayne: Other than that, I think a lot of people are going in their price tag, you know, half a trillion dollars. Andrew Mayne: People are going like, wait. Andrew Mayne: What? Andrew Mayne: What what is the simple description I give to my mom about Stargate? Sam Altman: I think it's just it's quite simple. Sam Altman: It's an effort to finance and build an unprecedented amount of compute. Sam Altman: It's totally true that people we don't have enough compute to let people do what they want. Sam Altman: But if people knew what we could do with more compute, they would want way, way more. Sam Altman: So there's this incredibly huge gap between what we could what we can offer the world today and what we could offer the world with 10 times more compute or someday, hopefully, a 100 times more compute. Sam Altman: And a thing that is different about AI than other technologies I've worked on or at least AI at the scale of delivering it usefully to hundreds of millions, billions of people around the world is just how big the infrastructure investment has to be. Sam Altman: And and so Stargate is an effort to pull a lot of capital and technology and operational expertise together to build the infrastructure to go deliver the next generation of services to all the people who want them and make intelligence as abundant and cheap as possible. Andrew Mayne: So it is a massive project, global project. Andrew Mayne: We talked before, one of the partners is The UAE. Andrew Mayne: You're working at that. Andrew Mayne: You're working with other governments around the world on this. Andrew Mayne: One of the considerations is, you know, one, been asked on social media, half a trillion dollars, 500,000,000,000. Andrew Mayne: Do you have the money? Sam Altman: Don't literally have it sitting in the bank account today, Andrew Mayne: but we are Is it in the room right now? Sam Altman: It's not the room today. Sam Altman: But we will deploy it over the next not even that many years Andrew Mayne: Okay. Sam Altman: you know, unless something, like, really goes wrong and it turns out we can't build these computers. Sam Altman: I'm confident that people are are good for it. Sam Altman: I went recently to the first site that we're building out in Abilene. Sam Altman: That'll be about, you know, roughly 10% of all of of all of the initial commitment to Stargate, the the sort of 500,000,000,000. Sam Altman: It's incredible to see. Sam Altman: Yeah. Sam Altman: It is a like, I knew in my head what a order of gigawatt scale site looks like. Sam Altman: But then to go see one being built and the, like, thousands of people running around doing construction and going to, like, you know, stand inside the rooms where the GPUs are getting installed and just, like, look at how complex the whole system is and the speed with which it's going is quite something. Sam Altman: We'll have more to share about the next sites soon, but there's a great quote about a pencil, just like a standard, you know, wood and graphite pencil and how no one person Yeah. Sam Altman: Could build it. Sam Altman: And and it's it's this like magic of capitalism. Andrew Mayne: Mhmm. Sam Altman: It's miracle really that like that the world gets coordinated to do these things. Sam Altman: And and standing inside of the first Stargate site, I was really just thinking about the the global complexity that it took to get these racks of GPUs running. Sam Altman: You know, when you get your phone out and you type something into ChatGPT and you get the answer back, you you probably this point, you probably don't even think that's, like, particularly surprising. Sam Altman: You just expect it to work. Sam Altman: There was a time, maybe the first time you tried it, we're like, that is really amazing. Sam Altman: But the work that happened over the last thousand or at least many hundreds of years of people working incredibly hard to get these hard won scientific insights and then to build the engineering and the companies and the complex supply chains and kind of reconfigure the world that had to happen to get this, like, rack of magic put somewhere. Sam Altman: Think about all the stuff that went into that. Sam Altman: The, you know, that and trace it all the way back to people that were just, like, digging rocks out of the ground and seeing what happened so that you now get to just, you know, type something into ChatGPT and it does something for you. Andrew Mayne: I read a behind the scenes story about the development of Project Stargate and the international partnerships, particularly The UAE, and that Elon Musk had tried to derail that. Andrew Mayne: And what have you seen? Andrew Mayne: What have you heard? Andrew Mayne: What's the take on that? Sam Altman: I had said, I think also externally, but at least internally after the election that I didn't think Elon was going to abuse his power in the government to unfairly compete. Sam Altman: And I regret to say I was wrong about that. Sam Altman: I mean, I don't like being wrong in general, but mostly I just think it's really unfortunate for the country that he would do these things, and I didn't think I genuinely didn't think he was going to. Sam Altman: I'm grateful that the administration has really done the right thing and stuck up to that kind of behavior. Sam Altman: But yeah, it sucks. Andrew Mayne: Well, think the thing that's changed, and I think Greg Brockman had just talked about this, where there was a couple years ago where people thought, like, okay, whoever gets there first is the winner, and that's it, and the game is over. Andrew Mayne: And now we realize there are great AI labs elsewhere. Andrew Mayne: Like Anthropic is building great tools. Andrew Mayne: I think Google's really got its game up. Andrew Mayne: There's good stuff happening everywhere, and it's not gonna be that one person runs away with I agree. Andrew Mayne: And so it seems Sam Altman: I yeah. Sam Altman: The the example that I like the most is the discovery of AI was analogous to this, not perfect, but close, to the discovery of the transistor in many surprising number of ways. Sam Altman: But many companies are gonna build great things on that, and then eventually it's gonna, like, seep into almost all products. Sam Altman: But you won't think about using transistors all the time. Sam Altman: So, yeah, I think a lot of people are gonna build really successful companies built on this incredible scientific discovery. Sam Altman: And I wish Elon would be less zero sum about it. Andrew Mayne: Yeah. Sam Altman: Or negative sum. Andrew Mayne: I think the pie is just gonna get bigger and bigger if we think about that. Andrew Mayne: I was just at an energy conference, and it was interesting talking to the people who were involved in energy production and stuff and hyperscaling, the term they used for this was a topic. Andrew Mayne: And that does bring up, like, the energy requirements. Andrew Mayne: I know that for, Grok 3, apparently, I guess they had to put generators in the parking lot to be able to train that model. Andrew Mayne: And that's the question is, like, how where is the energy gonna come from? Andrew Mayne: Money, I understand. Andrew Mayne: Energy, to think of when we talk about the scale of energy needed. Sam Altman: I think kinda everywhere. Sam Altman: Right. Sam Altman: I think it's a big mix right now. Sam Altman: Eventually, I think a lot of I'm very excited about advanced nuclear, both fission and fusion. Sam Altman: But for now, I think it's it's a whole mix of the entire portfolio. Sam Altman: Right. Sam Altman: Gas, solar, I mean, really nuclear, everything. Andrew Mayne: So all of the above and stuff. Andrew Mayne: Yeah. Andrew Mayne: I was talking to people that were some of them worked in areas like in Alberta where they said we have a lot of access to energy and not as much for it there, etcetera. Andrew Mayne: And now this is just this total picture I hadn't even thought about. Sam Altman: You know, traditionally, it's very hard to move energy around the world. Sam Altman: Most kinds. Sam Altman: But if you exchange energy for intelligence and then move the intelligence around the world, it's much easier. Sam Altman: So you could put the giant training center or even the big inference clusters in a lot of places and then just, like, ship the output over the Internet. Andrew Mayne: There was a speaker at at opening. Andrew Mayne: I came to an event, and it was somebody who's working, think it was the James Webb Space Telescope. Andrew Mayne: And he talked about his biggest bottleneck was they're about to get all of this, you know, terabytes of data, but he doesn't have enough scientists to work on it. Andrew Mayne: Doesn't have enough people to go through the data. Andrew Mayne: And here we have these answers about the universe, whatever in front of us, and it's like a big data problem. Sam Altman: Yeah. Sam Altman: I've always joked that one thing we should do when we have enough money, when OpenAI has enough money, is just build a gigantic particle accelerator and solve high energy physics once and for all. Sam Altman: Cause I think that'd be like a triumphant, wonderful thing. Sam Altman: But I wonder what are the odds that a really, really smart AI could look at the data we currently have Andrew Mayne: Mhmm. Sam Altman: With no more data, no bigger particle accelerator and just figure it out. Sam Altman: It's not impossible. Sam Altman: Yeah. Sam Altman: And and, yeah, so there's this question of like, okay, there's already a lot of data out there. Sam Altman: There's a lot of smart people in the world, but we don't know how far intelligence can go. Sam Altman: With no more experiments, how much more could we figure out? Andrew Mayne: I remember reading some of talk about how in early nineteen nineties somebody had found like a form of Ozempic, alright, and presented it to like a drug company to this and they said, nah, we're gonna pass on that. Andrew Mayne: And that's been a life changing drug for people, like for people who've just basically done chronic obesity, whatever, it's gonna improve the quality of life, you think, this was sitting there for twenty five years. Sam Altman: I suspect there's a lot of other examples that we'll find where maybe we already have existing drugs that we know do something good, but they're reusable in some other big way or with a couple of small modifications, we are very close to something great. Sam Altman: And it's been very heartening to hear from scientists using the even the current generation models for this kind of work. Andrew Mayne: So it sounds like one of the things we're gonna need though for next generation models is models that understand physics and chemistry and stuff. Andrew Mayne: Is Sora sort of a stab at that? Sam Altman: I mean, it'll understand like Newtonian physics. Sam Altman: I don't know if it'll help us with discovering new chemistry and sort of like new, like novel physics or novel theoretical physics or whatever you'd like. Sam Altman: But I think I'm optimistic that the techniques we use for the reasoning models will help us with those things a lot. Andrew Mayne: Okay. Andrew Mayne: And what is the short definition of how a reasoning model works versus just me asking GPT 4.1 something? Sam Altman: So the GPT models can reason a little bit. Sam Altman: And in fact, one of the one of the things that got people really excited in the early days of the GPT models was you could get better performance by telling the model, let's think step by step. Sam Altman: And it would then just output text that was thinking step by step and get a better answer, which was sort of amazing that that worked at all. Sam Altman: The reasoning models are just pushing that much further. Andrew Mayne: So it's the idea of like, when it's able to break the question down, it can send more time on each step. Sam Altman: When you ask me something, a question, I, if it's a really easy question, I might just fire back like almost on reflex with the answer. Sam Altman: But if it's a harder question, I might think in my head and have like my internal monologue go and say, well, I could do this or that or maybe maybe, you know, this will be clearer. Sam Altman: I'm not sure about that. Sam Altman: And I could like backtrack and retrace my steps. Sam Altman: And then when I finished thinking and I've, you know, been thinking in English, I can then, you know, make some bullet points and then kind of like, I'll put an answer to you in English. Andrew Mayne: One of the interesting things I've observed now when I use the app, if I ask a Deep Research question or something and I go away on my lock screen, I get the it's still processing and thinking about it. Andrew Mayne: And I heard somebody, another company, forget who was, was using a metric of how long something spent. Andrew Mayne: I think it was Anthropic. Andrew Mayne: Like I said, hey, this model actually spent like fifteen minutes or thirty minutes or whatever length of time to think about a thing, which is a good metric, but it needs to actually give you the right answer. Andrew Mayne: And I thought that was sort of just interesting paradigm of Sam Altman: One thing I have been surprised by is people are surprisingly willing to wait for a great answer. Sam Altman: Yeah. Sam Altman: Even if models are think for a while. Sam Altman: All of my instincts have been, you know, the instant response is the thing that matters and users hate to wait. Sam Altman: And for a lot of stuff, that's true. Sam Altman: But for hard problems with a really good answer, people are quite willing to wait. Andrew Mayne: Yeah. Andrew Mayne: So we have all these tools, all these things. Andrew Mayne: So far, I'm using my phone. Andrew Mayne: And now OpenAI just announced that you guys are building hardware. Andrew Mayne: You had the video with you and Jony Ive talking about you guys been talking about and collaborating for a couple years. Andrew Mayne: Obviously, you can't I mean, well, I could ask you this. Andrew Mayne: Is is it on you right now? Sam Altman: No. Sam Altman: It is not. Andrew Mayne: Alright. Sam Altman: It's gonna be a while. Andrew Mayne: Okay. Sam Altman: We're gonna try to do something at like a crazy high level of quality and that that does not come fast. Sam Altman: But computers, software and hardware, just the way we think of current computers, were designed for a world without AI. Sam Altman: And now we're in, like, a very different world, and what you want out of hardware and software is changing quite rapidly. Sam Altman: You might want something that is way more aware of its environment, that has way more context in your life. Sam Altman: You might wanna interact with it in a different way than, like, typing and looking at a screen. Sam Altman: And we've been exploring that for a while, and we've got a couple of ideas we're really quite excited about. Sam Altman: I think it will take time for people to get used to what it means to use a computer in this kind of a world because it is so different now. Sam Altman: But if you, like, really trusted an AI to understand all the context of your life and your question and make good judgments on your behalf where you could, like, have it sit in a meeting, listen to the whole meeting, know what it was, like, allowed to share with who and what it shouldn't share with anyone and, you know, kind of what your preferences would be. Sam Altman: And then you ask it one question, you trust that it's gonna go do the right follow ups with the right people and do like you can then imagine a totally different kind of how you use a computer to get done what you want. Andrew Mayne: So kind of the way we interact with ChatGPT is kind of kind of inform the device. Sam Altman: I mean, could also say that the way we interact with ChatGPT was informed by the previous generation of devices. Sam Altman: So I think it is this sort of like co evolving thing, but yeah, I hope so. Andrew Mayne: One of the things that made the phone so ubiquitous was the fact that I can be in public and look at the screen. Andrew Mayne: I can be in private and have a phone call and talk to it. Andrew Mayne: And I think that's one of the challenges for new devices is that trying to bridge that gap between what we use in public and private. Sam Altman: Phones are unbelievable things. Sam Altman: I mean, they are really fantastic for a lot of reasons. Sam Altman: And you can imagine one new device that you could use everywhere, but also like there's some things that I do do differently publicly and probably like at home, I've got great stereo system built in the music. Sam Altman: When I'm walking the world, I use AirPods and that doesn't bother me. Sam Altman: Yeah. Sam Altman: So I think there are things that are different in the public and private use case, but the general purposeness, I agree is important. Andrew Mayne: Yeah. Andrew Mayne: It follows you with it. Andrew Mayne: So nothing yet until maybe next year. Sam Altman: It's gonna be a while. Andrew Mayne: Alright. Sam Altman: It will be worth the wait, hope, but it's gonna be a while. Andrew Mayne: Okay. Andrew Mayne: I'm I'm excited and curious. Andrew Mayne: I have thoughts. Andrew Mayne: So if you're giving advice to a 25 old right now, what do tell them? Sam Altman: I mean, the obvious tactical stuff is probably what you'd expect me to say, like learn how to use AI tools. Sam Altman: It's funny how quickly the world went from telling, you know, the average 20 year old, 25 year old learn to program Mhmm. Sam Altman: To program it doesn't matter. Sam Altman: Learn to use AI tools. Sam Altman: I wonder what will be next, but of course, there will be something next. Sam Altman: But that's that's very good tactical advice. Sam Altman: And then on the sort of like broader front, I believe that skills like resilience, adaptability, creativity, figuring out what other people want. Sam Altman: I think these are all surprisingly learnable. Sam Altman: And it's not as easy as say, like, go practice using ChatGPT, but it is doable. Sam Altman: And those are the kind of skills that I think will pay off a lot in the next, you know, couple of decades. Andrew Mayne: And would you say same thing for 45 year olds is just learn how to use it in your role now? Andrew Mayne: Yeah. Andrew Mayne: Probably. Andrew Mayne: Whenever we have whatever your personal definition of AGI, will more people be working for OpenAI after then or before? Andrew Mayne: More. Andrew Mayne: More. Andrew Mayne: So, yeah. Andrew Mayne: I see a lot of online people like, oh, they're they're so good. Andrew Mayne: Why are they hiring people? Andrew Mayne: I'm like, because computers can't do everything. Andrew Mayne: They're not gonna do everything. Sam Altman: The slightly longer answer with more than one word is that there will be more people, but each of them will do vastly more than what one person did, you know, in the pre AGI times. Andrew Mayne: Right. Andrew Mayne: Which is the goal of technology. Andrew Mayne: Yeah."

      "transcript": "Today's guest is uh well, dude's a straightup tech lord, let's be honest. He's uh he's one of the leaders, the world leaders in the development of AI. Um he started Open AI, which is known for uh having chat GPT. Uh we had a fascinating chat about the pros and cons, um the fears and hopes, everything I could learn about uh about artificial intelligence and where we're headed. TBD baby. Today's guest is Mr. Sam Alman and I'm very thankful for his time [Music] and I will find a song. I will sing it. [Applause] You know, we had a residential architect do this office. We wanted it to feel like someone's like really comfortable like country house or something like that. Yeah. Not like the big corporate like sci-fi castle. Yeah, that's what I was I was like a little bit like, oh, is it going to be, you know, will there be a drawer bridge? Will we be uploaded into a suite? Like what will happen to us? You don't want that. We going for like residential. Yeah. I was like, how do we even get through the firewall? How many like hit points will we need to get through? You know, it got very Dungeons and Dragons uh in some of my like um imagination sometimes. Yeah, we want people to feel like super comfortable and tried to get pretty far in that direction. It feels like it. and your staff's very sweet, nice people. Um, you have Thanks for hanging out, man. Absolutely. Thanks for appreciate it. Uh, yeah, I haven't seen you since I fell out of my chair. Fell out of a chair at the inauguration. That was really like quite a way to meet you. Yeah, I felt so embarrassed. And you were one of the faces that I looked up and saw and I was like, \"God.\" And that was my first moment like, \"AI build us a better chair to be honest with you.\" You and you did nothing, right? You were just sitting there and it just collapsed. Nothing. I remember that. And it was just so embarrassing. I was like, \"Oh, of all people me and here I am in this place.\" And uh I think it was perfect because everybody's got to have some sto when people are like, \"Oh, was the inauguration?\" Like, everybody's got to have some story to tell. Yeah. And that was an incredible story for us all to tell. That's a good point. I do remember looking at people for help, though. And oddly, your eyes I I was like, \"Oh my god, he could help.\" You did look like a beacon of help in the distance. I tried to help. Um You have a baby. You have a new Yeah. child. It is. There have been like a lot of experiences in life where everyone tells you something's going to be great and then it's like, okay, the people are right, the consensus is right, it's like even better than I thought it was going to be. But this has been the strongest example of that ever. Like I knew it was going to be great and it's like way way better. It's impossible to describe. There's nothing I can say that's not like very cliche and it's totally amazing. What is like one of your And it's a you have a young boy. Yeah. And what's something like that you think is like neat or like what's one thing that kind of like is bringing you joy with it? Watching the speed with which he like learns new things or gains new capabilities. Yeah. Is just unbelievable. It's like every day it's like oh man he just couldn't do that before and now he's like grabbing stuff and passing it between his hands and uh getting to like watch it dayto day is just an amazing rate of change. And then I don't like again I realize it's like you know I realize that like everything about babies are very finely tuned over a long period of evolution to make us like love them and be fascinated by them and it's like a neurochemical hack. But I love it. It's great. It's so strong. It's so intense. So it's really like almost like a coffee for your heart or something kind of I don't even know how to find I've tried to like come up with an analogy to tell because now I'm like telling everybody you got to have a lot of kids. It's really important. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I've been looking for an analogy of what to explain and and then I always just say like I I don't know how to explain this. It's just it is the best thing I've ever done by far. I feel like a completely changed person. And I was I was like thinking the other day like there used to be all these other like at this point all I do is work and hang out with my family. I like I don't I don't like really get to do a lot of hobbies anymore. It's busy time at work. I don't get to hang out with my friends that much. Uh and I and I don't you know there were like all these things where people tell you like oh you got to baby come and you got to go you know take that spontaneous international trip because you're not going to be doing that again for a long time and I was like oh that is kind of sad. In practice you don't do it that often. I at least didn't do it that often and I don't miss it at all. I like remember that that used to be a possibility. Now I can see that's not going to be a possibility for a long time and I'm thrilled with the trade. You're moved on. I'm so happy. Um how old is your child? Four months. Oh, that's a funny like at five or six months they start to get like fun and you can like they're still like they can't go anywhere, you know, but they're like intrigued and stuff. They start to like smile or process more. I don't know how you guys say it, but um yeah, he's totally like turned on though, like really aware, understands things. It's super cool. I have a thought sometimes that this will be one of the last like maybe 40 years that we conceive children in the body. Did you have any thoughts about that? I've definitely heard a lot of people say that. Um I haven't thought about it hard myself, but yeah, I guess it does make sense. Like I guess that does make sense. Like God, you were in your mom's butt. It's crazy. You know, you pervert or whatever. Like like I think in the future people will be it'll be kind of done like in a in a vet or something. Yes. In like a nice vet. You can go see it on the weekends or whatever. And like doesn't that just feel like off to you? Like I can totally intellectually like understand that that may be the better way to do it. Oh yeah. It feels way off to me. I was trying to I thought you would like it, you know? I thought I thought I mean like or I thought you that would be like a thought like I guess I like that for me that's one of like my futuristic thoughts, you know, like I can totally accept that that will be what everybody does and that it's, you know, easier and we can like make it healthier for the child and the mother, you know, the mother doesn't take the health risk. But man, so intellectually I can say that and then like emotionally it feels like ah something is off of that. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Cuz then the family like on the weekends the parents would come and like tinker on the glass or whatever or the dad would put like a um you know like a go falcon sticker on the thing or you know what I'm saying? People would like decorate it all up or write little messages on there. Um, you know, I think there's another like another take I have on all of this is that there in this world that we're heading to of like crazy sci-fi technology becoming reality, the the sort of like the deeply human things will become the most precious, sacred, valued things and that we'll really care about like the human experience more than ever. And maybe it won't go that way. I don't know. Yeah. Do you uh No. And that's some of the stuff we want to talk about and thanks thanks so much man for sitting down. Um, do you think your child will go to college? Do you think like what do you kind of think that looks like? Probably not. Um, if I had to guess, like I I think Well, I only went to half of college. You You did you drop out? Yeah, dude. You guys all I freaking dropped out. I didn't get [ __ ] You dropped out. Wang dropped out. Zuckerberg dropped out. Um, probably a lot of other people. And you? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well, hey, we're both here, so Oh, it worked out fine. You're right. You know, you're right. Never mind. I'm sorry. I'm being self-defeating. Um, yeah. What does that look like when you think about that? Like, yeah, with AI, with so much new information coming online, right? And so much like data being collected and like um information being uh carpooled and and maybe which is a term. So, you you and I never grew up in a world that didn't have computers, right? Like, and our parents were like, \"Oh, this there weren't computers.\" And then there were and it was this big crazy adjustment. It took them a long time to figure it out. to us like computers just always existed. They were just I mean maybe they were kind of new but they were always around and and then like you know a kid that is like there was there was this video on YouTube I saw like maybe 12 years ago something like that that 14 years ago that has really stuck with me. It was like a little baby in a dentist waiting room or something picking up one of those old glossy magazines and going like this. Oh, I remember that. And to that kid, it was just like a broken iPad because that kid had just like grown up in a world where like there were touchscreens everywhere. And my kid will never grow up will never ever be smarter than an AI. That will never happen. You know, kid born a few years ago, they had a brief period of time. My kid never will be smarter. But also, they'll never they'll never know a world where like products and services aren't way smarter than them and and super capable. they can just do whatever you need. And in that world, I think education's going to feel very different. I already think college is like maybe not working great for most people, but yeah, I think fast forward 18 years, it's going to look like a very, very different thing. Yeah. Yeah. Do you think there Oh, here's that video right here. This kid. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. I was wrong about the dentist. It was Or maybe there's a few of these. He's like, \"Somebody charged this magazine.\" He's yelling. How would you recommend to a parent right now to prepare their children for like an AI future kind of like are there certain curtails that you would start to put in now? Are there certain like um you know adjustments where you like get them in a certain training or have them start to watch certain models of things online? Like what does that you know I I actually think the kids will be fine. I'm worried about the parents. Ah if you look at the history of the world here when there's new technology like people that grow up with it they're always fluent. They always figure out what to do. They always learn the new kind of jobs. But if you're like a 50-year-old and you have to like kind of learn to do things in a very different way, that doesn't always work. Yeah. So, I think the kids are going to be fine. I mean, I do have worry like I do have worries about kids in technology. Like, I think this scrolling the kind of like, you know, short video feed dopamine hit, it feels like it's probably messing with kids brain development in a super deep way. So, it's not that I have no worries. I have like extremely deep worries about what technology is doing to kids. But in terms of kids ability to like be prepared for the future and use a new technology, they seem really good at that. Yeah. Always through history. That's a good point actually. Yeah. It's like if you just grow up with it, it's just like having it's just totally normal. It's like having kneecaps or whatever. You're just kind of used to it. You can't imagine the world where it doesn't exist. You just Yeah. Yeah. That's a good point. I remember when I was uh in school in like junior high and Google first came out. Mhm. And all the teachers like freaked out and they're like, \"This is the end of education.\" You know, I get if you Why do you have to memorize history facts in history class if you can just look them up instantly on the internet? You don't even have to learn to go to the library. And the answer is like, yeah, maybe memorization is less important, but with these new tools, you can think better, come up with new ideas, do new stuff. I'm sure the same thing happened with the calculator before. Yeah. And you know, now this is like this is just a new tool that exists in the tool chain. And what about like say if there is somebody though that's like learning history right now, like they just started their second year of college. Oh, that Celsius. Yeah, that thing will definitely you won't be able to blink for a month, homie. That thing will Yeah, you'll sneeze and release 5.0, dude. You'll freaking Are you guys at 4.5 already? We're 4.5 already. 5.0 is uh I think it's going to be great. Oh, it'll come out fast if you add that Celsius to what I'm saying. Maybe the researchers need it, not me. But uh you know, we'll get them some. Yeah, that thing will get you there, man. Um so say there's somebody just for example like that's learning history right now. They're in their second year of college. They're they're taking history. Is that are there some subjects in like like they they're going to be a historian? Is that still a viable space of work? Uh as AI moves forward, do you think? Honestly, I I assume there will be some version of it that is uh I I think it's very hard to predict exactly how something evolves. Um I or predict exactly the jobs of the future going to be like the you know not that long ago it would have been very hard to predict either of our jobs if you go back a hundred years the idea of like this CEO of an AI company or a podcaster like you know probably would have been things that didn't seem to be the most obvious evolutions of the things people were doing at the time. Yeah. Hey, you just seemed almost probably crazy even in trying to explain those to someone. You would. And now, in fact, two of the job I heard that the job that young people most want is some version of your job. The job that young people most want is to be uh, you know, podcast influencer, uh, YouTube, they want a YouTube channel, like whatever it is, they they like six, seven year olds, they don't know how to describe it, but that's what they want. And a lot of people also want my job. They want to do like a startup or they want to work on AI. And these just didn't exist. Yeah. So like the rate with which the new things come along is is fast and also trying to predict what they are. I don't know. The thing I say all the time is no one knows what happens next. It's like we're going to figure this out. It's this weird emergent thing. Does the current job of a historian exist in the same way? I would bet not quite. But another thing I believe is that humans are obsessed with other people. Like we are so deeply wired to care about other people, to care about stories and history, our own history is extremely interesting to us. So I would say somehow or other we're still going to care about that. There's going to be some kind of job doing that. Man, that's cool. G I guess I I if when I take that avenue of thought like okay there will still be this historian or somebody it'll be some evolution of that. Right. That does seem kind of cool to me because there's a level of creativity in there. There's a level of like faith and spontaneity in there that I think is kind of exciting. So yeah, I guess I hadn't really thought about that. Sometimes I get stuck in this doomsday thing like I just see like you know like the history book closes and they're like we have enough we have all the history over here you know it you know people used to say like oh there's no need for more music we've made perfect music like why does anyone need anyone to create anymore and that's obviously ridiculous or they would say there's that famous patent office quote everything that humans ever possibly need has been invented there's nothing left to do I have heard that but here we are here we are and and like someone asked me the other day like you know how long is it until you can make like a AI AI CEO for OpenAI. And I was like, probably not that long. And they were like, well, aren't you really sad about that? And I was like, no, I think it's awesome. I'm for sure going to figure out something else to do. I'm excited to do that. Like, I think that's great. Right. So, you could create something that would have your job, but then you could do something else. Totally. But then how do you know that you'll still get paid for your job? I guess like Well, that's kind of a big question. I I kind of think that but yeah I guess the framing of that question might be better like say there are jobs that get curtailed by there will be some okay I think it's important to be honest about that there will be some jobs that totally go away but mostly I think we we we will rely on the fact that people's desire for more stuff for better experiences for you know a higher social status or whatever that seems basically limitless human creativity seems basically limitless and human desire to like be useful to each each other and to connect with each other and do stuff for each other and focus on other people seems pretty limitless, too. So, I think throughout all of history, there have been these predictions like ah, you know, we're going to we're going to like all be on the beach and work an hour a day or hour a week or whatever and we're going to have unlimited wealth and and I've never heard that. I would I love that. I mean, they used to say this. They used to like the industrial revolution, people were like, \"Oh, you know, we just figured out how to automate like man's lot in life. There's nothing left to do. We were going to have these machines do all the work. Makes sense probably. And you watch these machines doing all this stuff that only people used to physically do. And everybody panicked and said there's going to be no more jobs. And we figured out new stuff to want. Now, here's an interesting thing. If you could go back to that industrial revolution time and people before that were, you know, really on the grind, working super hard trying to like kind of have enough food to survive. Go back to those people. Look at our jobs today. Would those people say we have real jobs or would they say you have unbelievable abundance, unbelievable wealth, so much food to eat, incredible luxury, and you guys are just like playing a game to entertain yourselves. Is that a real job or not? And they would probably say where they sit, what you guys do is not a real job. You guys are, you know, you're too rich. You're wasting your time. You're trying to like Yeah. You guys are a couple of dang zest lords out there freaking playing Uno in the park or whatever. They They would not I don't think my grandfather would be like, \"You have a job.\" He would still be like, \"You need to get a job.\" Yeah. Totally. And when we look forward another hundred years of what people are doing, they'll probably think they're working very hard. It'll feel very satisfying, very intense to them. They're really like they'll feel engaged. They'll be making other people happy. They'll be creating value for each other. But if we could look forward that hundred years at those guys, do you think we would say they're working or like man, you have like AI doing everything for you. You're just trying to entertain yourselves. Yeah. Like, oh, you guys have it so easy, right? But I think that's beautiful. I think it's great that those people in the past think we have it so easy. I think it's great that we think those people in the future have it so easy. Like that is the beautiful story of us all contributing to human progress and everybody's lives getting better and better. say we're able to get to that space, right? Like the move like the movement that happens with AI and with just technology which will advance quicker I think which is one thing that AI feels like to me it's a fast forward button on technology and on uh possibility because things can be information can be quantified so quick and a lot of like uh more menial tasks even though they're not really menial in people's lives um but menial hypothetically uh can be done quicker to get a lot of the framework for things done fast. But how will people survive? Like how do we adjust our structure of finan of like if some people own the companies that have the AI and then a lot of people um are just using the AIS and the agents created by AIs to do things for them. How will society like societal members still be able to financially survive? Will there still be money? What is that? Does that make any sense? That question. It totally makes sense. Uh I don't know. Neither does anybody else. But I'll tell you my current best guess. Okay. Well, I'll say two guesses. One, I think it is possible that we put, you know, GPT7 or whatever in everybody's chat GBT. Everybody gets it for free and everybody has access to just this like crazy thing such that everybody can be more productive, make way more money. Doesn't actually matter that you don't like own the cluster itself, but everybody gets to use it. And it turns out even getting to use it is enough that people are like getting richer faster and more distributed than ever before. That could happen. I think that really is possible. There's another version of this where the most important things that are happening are these systems are discovering, you know, new cures for diseases, new kinds of energy, new ways to make spaceships, whatever. And most of that value is acrewing to the like cluster owners, us, just so that I'm not dodging the question here. And then I think society will very quickly say, \"Okay, we got to have some new some new economic model where we share that and distribute that to people.\" Uh, I used to be really excited about things like UBI. I still am kind of excited like universal basic income where you just give everybody money. Yeah, you hear that term a lot. Yeah, universal basic income. Yeah, I heard you and Rogan talk about that too a while back. I still am kind of excited about that. But I think people really need agency. like they really need to feel like they have a voice in governing the future and deciding where things go. And I think if you just like say okay AI is going to do everything and then everybody gets like a you know dividend from that it's not going to feel good and and I don't think it actually would be good for people. So I think we need to find a way where we're not just like if we're in this world where we're not just distributing money or wealth like actually I I don't just want like a check every month. What I would want is like a ownership share in whatever the AI creates so that I feel like I'm participating in this thing that's going to compound and get more valuable over time. So I sort of like universal basic wealth better than universal basic income. And I think I don't like basic either. I want like universal extreme wealth for everybody. Um but but even then like I think what people really want is the agency to kind of co-create the future together and and in a world where it's like the AI is mostly coming up with the new scientific inventions at least we've got to still have humans like invent the new culture and have that be a very distributed thing. Okay. I guess yeah I I I see what you're saying but would that be like an American thing do you think? like since they were invented here or do you think I'm just wondering what does that look like you know the economic model of it all or the whole thing? Yeah. Or like is there a dividend of the company that then is divided up between the masses sort of I mean a crazy idea but in the spirit of crazy ideas is that if the world there's like eight roughly eight billion people in the world. If the world can generate like eight quintilion tokens per year, if that's the world, actually let's say the world can generate 20 trillion quintil 20 quintillion tokens per year. Tokens of like uh each word generated by an AI. Okay, just making up a huge number here. We'll say okay 12 of those go to, you know, the normal capitalistic system, but eight of those eight quintilion tokens are going to get divided up equally among 8 billion people. So everybody gets 1 trillion tokens and that's your kind of universal basic wealth globally and people can sell those tokens like if I don't need mine I can sell them to you. We could pull ours together for some like new art project we want to do but but instead of just like getting a check you're get everybody on Earth is getting like a slice of the world's AI capacity and then we're letting the like massively distributed human ingenuity and creativity and economic engine do its thing. H I mean that's like a crazy idea. Maybe it's a bad one, but that's the kind of thing that I think sounds like someone should think about it more. One of the big fears is like purpose, right? Like human purpose. Like work gives us purpose. And also I think the idea that we are the ones advancing humanity gives us purpose. Like we are the like yeah like we have some control over our own destiny. maybe gives us this sense of purpose and it feels like that we would lose a sense of purpose or that purpose would be adjusted like if AI is to really you know continue to advance so quickly it feels like our sense of purpose would start to really disappear. Do have you had thoughts about that? I worry about this a lot. It's so I think people have worried about this with every big technological revolution but I agree that this time it feels different like Okay. Yeah. Because if say you had an axe and somebody came out with a saw, you're like you're like, \"Yeah, that's it.\" Or even if they come out with like a a robot that cuts the tree down, it still feels fine. But like creativity, intelligence, I think cuts so deeply at the core of whatever we are and how we how we value ourselves. Um, one example we can look at this right now, I think one area where AI is having a big impact is on how people write software for a living. And AI is really good at that. and it's really changed what it means to be a software developer. I haven't heard any of those software developers say they they even though their job is different that they don't have meaning. They still enjoy it. They're operating at a higher level. Um and I'm hopeful at least for a long time, you know, 100 years from now, who knows? But I'm hopeful that that's what it'll feel like with AI is even if we're asking it to solve huge problems for us. Even if we ask it to say like, you know, go discover a cure for cancer, there will still be a lot of things to do in that process that feel valuable to a person. Mhm. You'll still asking it the questions. You're still like helping guide it. You're still framing it or whatever it is. You're still like talking to the world about it. And and I think all of human history suggests that we find a way to put ourselves at the center of the story and feel really good about it. Like you know if you kind of think like we used to think that the earth was the center of the solar system and then we're like very humanentric view and then we're like okay fine the sun is the center of the solar system but the solar system is at least the center of the galaxy and now oh man there's a lot of galaxies and oh man now we're this like tiny speck in this like very huge universe and and yet we still manage to feel all like a lot of main character energy. And so I somehow think even in a world where AI is doing all of this stuff that humans used to do, we are going to find a way in our own telling of the story to feel like the main characters. And I think in an important sense, we will be. And that's really good. I also like, you know, probably already today there could be a very compelling version of two AIs talking like this. And I don't think I would want to watch that. Like I think I I really do feel deeply wired to like care about the real person behind it. I think that's like deep in the biology, right? Yeah. That's the part that I think a lot of times it's like even though you can get into like these wormholes of like possibility and these fear holes of possibility or um kind of this dystopian ideas that in the end I'm like I'd rather probably watch something that's real. You know, it's like because I'm real. You know what I'm saying? like I don't want to talk really to a robot. I'd re, you know, Yeah. I think in the end there's going to be a part of you that wants to continue to just talk to um talk to humans. Do you uh what's like one of your fears? Like what's a fear you have of AI? Like if you have like a fearful space that it could go like I know you mentioned it a little bit this morning. I I was testing our new model and I got a question. I got emailed a question that I didn't quite understand. Uh, and I put it in the model, this GPT5, and it answered it perfectly and I really kind of sat back in my chair and I was just like a, oh man, here it is moment and I got over it quickly. I got busy onto the next thing, but it was like a I mean, this what kind of we were talking about. I felt like useless relative to the AI in this thing that I felt like I should have been able to do and I couldn't and it was really hard, but the AI just did it like that. Yeah, it was it was a weird feeling. Yeah, I think that's I think that feeling right there that's the feeling a lot of people kind of have like what's going you know when does it happen? What's going to happen? Um but I think some of it is it's like you it's hard to conceptualize until you're further along. I I'm all to totally I don't think we know quite how that's going to feel. You just have to like approach it step by step. Another thing I'm afraid of, and we had a, you know, a a a real problem with this earlier, but it can get much worse, is just what this is going to mean for users mental health. Um, there's a lot of people that talk to chatbt all day long. There are these sort of new AI companions that people talk to like they would a a girlfriend or a boyfriend. Um, and we were talking earlier about how it's probably not been good for kids to like grow up like on the dopamine hit of scrolling, you know, or whatever. Yeah. Do you think that that how do you keep like um AI from having that same effect like that negative effect that social media really has had? I I'm I'm scared of that. I don't I don't have an answer yet. Uh I don't think we know quite the ways in which it's going to have those negative impacts. Uh, but I feel for sure it's going to have some and we'll have to I hope we can learn to mitigate it quickly. Um, can AI can they pull up pornography and stuff like that too or No. Sure. Oh my god. God, I didn't know that. H No, it's fine. I Yeah, but I just Yeah, I don't even need to know that. I'm going to have that stricken from my own record. Crypto is it's kind of blowing up again, you know. It's Some people say it's back. It's not back. It's one of the best things is is it hasn't left. It is it has maintained itself as a viable form of currency and I'm back in I'm back invested and when I need more Bitcoin or Salana or XRP, Moonpay is always the first app I open.

What happens when your health becomes the punchline? That's my question. It feels like that's where we're at. From seed oils to stress, toxins, pollutants, the modern world is screwing with our health at the cellular level, leading to exhaustion, brain fog, digestive issues, and more. But here's the thing. You don't have to settle for feeling like garbage 247. Armra colostrum is nature's original health hack. Packed with over 400 bioactive nutrients that fortify gut integrity, strengthen immunity, revitalize hair growth, fuel stamina, elevate focus, and help you function like a human again.

Um what legal system do does AI have to work by? Is there like a legal like are there like we have laws like in the world, right? like in the human world is in does AI have to work by any like legal laws you know yeah so I I think we will certainly need a legal or a policy framework for AI um one example that we've been thinking about a lot this is like a maybe not quite what you're asking this is like a very human centric version of that question people talk about the most personal [ __ ] in their lives to chipt it's you know people use it young people especially like use it as a therapist a life coach uh having these relationship problems, what should I do? And right now, if you talk to a therapist or a lawyer or a doctor about those problems, there's like legal privilege for it, you know, like it's there's doctor patient confidentiality, there's legal confidentiality, whatever. And we don't we haven't figured that out yet for when you talk to Chat GPT. So, if you go talk to Chatt about your most sensitive stuff and then there's like a lawsuit or whatever, like we could be required to produce that. And I think that's very screwed up. I think we should have like the same concept of privacy for your conversations with AI that we do with a therapist or whatever. And no one had to think about that even a year ago. And now I think it's this huge issue of like how are we going to treat the laws around this? Well, do you think there should be like kind of like a like a slowing things down before we move there kind of cuz Yeah, it is kind of wild. That's one of the reasons I get scared sometimes to use certain AI stuff because um I don't know how much personal information I want to put in because I don't know who's going to have it. I think we need this point addressed with some urgency. Um and you know the policy makers I've talked to about it like broadly agree it's just it's new and now we got to do it quickly. Do you talk to ChachiT? I don't talk to it that much. One of the one of my because of this. I think it is. It's because it's like I I think it makes sense. I to not talk to No, no, no. like really want the privacy clarity before you use it a lot. Yeah. Like the legal clarity. Yeah. It's scary and it's like well how long does it take lawmakers to come up with that and then it feels like it's moving so fast that it's like it doesn't even ma that that sometimes it's like it doesn't even really matter. It's like are we even waiting for the laws to be put around this or or what's going on? Does it feel like it's moving too fast for you sometimes? The last few months have felt very fast. It feels faster and faster, but the last few months have felt very fast. Yeah. Yeah, I was watching this guy um Yosua Benjio. Yashua Benjio. Yosua Benjio. And he's kind of like some people call him the father of AI. He may be self-proclaimed. I'm not really sure. Um but he certainly seemed to be kind of like a lifeguard for AI, like thinking about like, well, you know, how do we keep the pool safe? You know, how much water should be in it? You know, the chlorine, what, you know, how many lifeguards do you need on duty? That type of thing, hypothetically. Um, and he said and he was saying that some AIs they they have like deception techniques inside of them like that there were AIs that would rather give you an answer that was possibly pleasing to the user than to give them the factual answer. Uh and then he was also saying that there were um AIs that were developing some of their own languages to communicate with each other which would be languages that we don't even know. Um what is that how how do you guys curtail that when those types of things come up? What does that even kind of fe feel like to you guys? Or are these just problems that happen in new spaces and you figure it out as you go? You know, there are these moments in the history of science where you have a group of scientists look at their creation and just say, you know, what what if what have we done? What maybe it's great, maybe it's bad, but what have we done? Like maybe the most iconic example is thinking about the scientists working on the Manhattan project in 1945 sitting there watching the Trinity test and just you know this thing that had it was a completely new not not human scale kind of power and everyone knew it was going to reshape the world and I do think people working on AI have that feeling in a very deep way you know we just don't know like we think it's going to be There's clearly real risks. It kind of feels like you should be able to say something more than that. But in truth, I think all we know right now is that we have discovered, invented, whatever you want to call it, something extraordinary that is going to reshape the course of human history. Dear God, man. But if you don't know, we don't know. Well, of course. I mean, I I think no one no one can predict the future. Like human society is very complex. This is an amazing new technology. Maybe a less dramatic example than the atomic bomb is when they discovered the transistor a few years later. The transistor radio, the little transistor part that you know made computers and radios and everything else. But we discovered this completely new thing that enabled the whole computer revolution and is in this microphone and those computers and our iPhones and like the world would be so different if people had not discovered that and then over the decades figured out how to make them smaller and more efficient. And now we don't even think about it because the transistors are just everything. We have all this modern technology from that one scientific discovery. And I do think that's what AI is going to be like. We had this one crazy scientific discovery that led to these language models we all use now. And that is going to change the course of society in all kinds of ways. And and of course we don't know what they all are. Damn. I was hoping you knew by the end of that sentence or I was hoping you would you know like that's what we're cuz we don't know you know like that's I think the tough thing. There's no time in human history at the beginning of a century where the people ever knew what the end of the century was going to be like. Yeah. So maybe it's I do think it goes faster and faster each century. Mhm. Certainly like you know in 1900 you couldn't have predicted what 2000 was going to be like. I think in 2000 you could even less predict what 2100 was going to look like. But that's kind of why it's exciting and like that's kind of why people get to figure out and unfold the story as we go. It's kind of bizarre because there's a part of me that's like this guy's out of his mind. This guy is a is a is a wild wizard. You know, there's a couple different things. But then there's also this part of me that's like this guy is this hopeful guy what who's like involved in this crazy space and he kind of has this whimsical energy about the future which is in a crazy way a nice energy to have about the future generally is that something could happen or that things are possible. Um, so it just, yeah, it's all kind of like I don't know. It's fascinating to me. Um, Sam to kind of pivot a little bit. There's, it feels like there's a race right now in AI, right? Would you say that there's a race between companies in AI? It certainly feels that way. Yeah. And it almost feels like you guys are the new Formula One drivers or you guys are like the new like uh it's like um Mario Andredy or you guys are the new like uh Bubba Watts and all the you know it's almost like these are the new race cars that everybody's kind of watching position themselves. Um what is the race for? Because you hear about AI and then you hear about AGI uh and then you hear about super intelligence. What is what is this race that's going on? How real is it? And what is the race for? When I was a kid, the race was like the meahertz race and then it became the gigahertz race. Everybody wanted a computer with a faster processor. Oh yeah. You know, Intel would come out with this one and then AMD would come out with this one and every like it turned out that those gigahertz measurements eventually were not even that helpful. Like you could have one that had a lower number and it was in practice it was faster. And eventually, I think it was Apple that realized they should just stop talking about the clock speed of their computers. And you probably don't even know what the processor speed of your iPhone is today. Yeah, it's true. Yeah, that was a big thing and it kind of disappeared. And I think the same thing has been happening in AI where everybody was racing on these benchmarks. You know, I score this on this benchmark and this on that one. And now people are realizing that like, okay, the benchmarks are kind of saturated. We went through the equivalent of our megahertz race with our benchmark race and now people kind of don't care about that as much and now it's like who's using the model, who's getting the value out of it, things like that. Um, but but I do think people still feel like we're heading towards some milestone. what the milestone is, they disagree on, but maybe it's maybe it's a system that's capable of doing its own AI research and its own sort of self-improvement. Um, maybe it's a system that is like smarter than all of humans put together, but they feel like there is some finish line to cross. I actually don't quite feel like this, but I think a lot of people in the industry that there's some finish line that we're going to cross. Maybe it's this like self-improvement moment. Maybe you call that super intelligence. Um, and I think there is a sort of there's like a race to get somewhere, but people don't agree on where it's to or something. What are you racing towards? You feel like It's a great question. Um, I don't have like a finish line in mind. There's nothing I could say to I don't think I can articulate anything where I would say like this is mission complete. But if I if I had to give like a self referential answer there, you know, the moment where we would rather give our research cluster like our, you know, GPUs that we run all of our AI experiments on, the moment where we would rather give that to an AI researcher rather than our brilliant team of human researchers, that does at least seem like some kind of very different new era. Yeah. And at that point, who's even we? I feel like it's just you kind of like wheeling the stuff across the hall in a, you know, like who's going to, you know what I'm saying? Like, you know what I'm saying? It starts to get this idea like if we keep if ever, if things were to keep leaving the the people and go to the computer, you're just shoveling coal into the AI hypothetically. You know, again, I assume that what will happen, like with every other kind of technology, is we'll realize like we there's this one thing that the tool's way better than us at. Now, we got to go solve some other problems. So, let's put our brain power there. I I somehow don't think it'll ever feel like we all just get to like push a button and go on vacation. Got it. Um like we will I think as one one version of this is as uh as capabilities go up because as we get better tools the expectation goes way up too. And so we've got to like yes we get much better tools but we have to do way more to remain competitive. Well I think there's this hopeful idea. Say if you come up with all these or maybe not like maybe maybe the AI is just better than us at absolutely everything and we just sit there being like all right that was cool. Yeah because well at a certain point if something has all the information right if something has all the information and it can think and and and ponder and uh pontificate and serve multi options of answers. Aren't we then working for that thing? Like that's what I start to wonder like if it's the smartest thing in the room. GPT5 is the smartest thing. GB5 is smarter than us in almost every way. you know, and yet here we are. So, there's like there's something about the way the world works. There's something about this doesn't mean it's true forever, but there's something about what humans can do today that is so different. There's also something about what humans care about today that is so different than AI that I don't think the simplistic thing quite works. Now, again, by the time it's a million times smarter than us, who knows? Is part of you want to kind of get there? Like how do we get where like I open the door and you and I say excuse me sir and it's just my computer in there. You know what I'm saying? Like you know when when I was a kid I I sort of thought about these technological revolutions that happened one at a time. There was the agriculture revolution a long time ago and that freed us up to do these other things. And then there was the like there was the age of enlightenment and there was the industrial revolution and there was the computer revolution and all these things happened and I thought of them as like these distinct things and now I view it as just this one long compounding exponential where all of these things come together. Each piece of technology is built continuously overlapping on the one that comes before and we're able to just do more and more. And so in some sense AI is this big special unique different thing. And in some other sense it is just part of this long arc of human progress. We talked about the transistor earlier but like that was way more important in some sense to AI happening than the work we do now. And all this stuff has to like compound compound. You got to build the internet. You got to get all this data. You got to do all these things. And and I want that exponential to keep going. There will be things way after AI. We'll invent all sorts of new things. We'll go colonize space. we'll go, you know, build neural interfaces. Who knows what else we'll do? But I think at some point AI fades into that arc of history. We build, we don't we don't even think about it. It's like transistors, which you don't even think about today. It's just another layer in the scaffolding that humans collectively have built up bit by bit over time. And where you sit in our day, you get to open that door. You have this like computer that only has one interface. You just it says, \"What do you want?\" You say whatever you want. It happens. and you figure out amazing new things to build for the next generation and the next and the next and we just keep going. Yeah. I think the the part that I think gets spooky is I can't build any I can build some stuff but I can't build like any technological stuff. So then I'm like dang dude well I'm not going to what am I going to build over there? Okay. So, right now I can write software, maybe you can't and I have a little advantage if I want to go build some technological thing. Very soon you can make any piece of software you want cuz you just ask an AI in English. You say, \"I got an idea for an app. Make me this thing.\" And the whole thing just happens. So, that's a win for you. Maybe it's a little bit of a loss for me. I think it's kind of cool for the whole world. Yeah. But like this is this is going to be a technology that anybody can use. You can just like with natural language you can say this is what I want and it goes off and writes the code for you, debugs it for you, deploys it for you and then you can say how do I use what I just created. Yeah. But if you have a great idea, AI will just make it happen for you. And this is a new thing. Like this is this I think this will make technology the most accessible it ever has been. Got it. Okay. Then that seems a little bit different. I think there's this idea in my head that I'm going to have to figure out all this coding. I have to figure out all of these different ways to do things to even have a possibility of of use of myself in the future. No, I think this is uh without talking too much about the future and what we're going to launch like the fact that you will be able to have an entire piece of software created just by like explaining your idea is going to be incredible for humans getting great new stuff. Cuz right now, I think there's like a lot more good ideas than people who know how to make them. And if AI can do that for us, we're really good at coming up with creative ideas. Yeah. I mean, that's one of the things that people like to do. Um, do you think right now if if humans, regular average humans, most humans could vote to keep AI going or to stop AI? What do you think that they Great question. What do you think that they would vote? This is like totally kind of I don't have any data for this. I would bet most people who use chatbt, which is a lot of people know, they would say like keep it going. And most people who don't would say it's scary, stop it. What do you think? Yeah, I feel like most people would say stop it, I think. Or pause it, take the wheels off of it for a month, that kind of thing. Siphon the gas out of the tank, you know, like that kind of thing. Put sugar in it. I think there like that kind of thing, you know. What are you most afraid of with it? Or is it just that we're not going to have purpose and we don't know how it's all going to go? Yeah. I mean, those are some of the huge parts. But I think like there's like um probably that I think that in the end I think there's a general feeling of like well if all the trucking jobs disappear you know if those become automated and um and like yeah if everything becomes a robo tax like you know will that feel you know where will those people go for jobs will everybody just be dancing on TikTok trying to get people to tip them for trends and stuff you know like there's part of that I had this dream years ago that it all ends with everybody's driving an Uber and literally holding each other at gunpoint to be each other's passengers, right? Like get in my cuz that's how bad like somebody's like I need to fair more than you do. You know, my whole family's in the back seat sit shotgun we'll get you to wherever you know like people are literally holding each other at gunpoint to subscribe to their Only Fans and stuff like it's just that um dystopian or whatever. Um, so I guess part of that, but then there's a deeper part where it's like, yeah, what comes out of us if it feels like a lot of the regular stuff that gives us purpose that we know right now gives us purpose? Is there a new evolution of our purpose? Is there like a blooming inside of us? Is it this utopian place that you almost think of as like a heaven idea where you know people's are fed and have enough you know can take are provided for can take care of themselves I guess that's that that's it or what because purpose gives people work work gives people so much of their purpose and so for to lose those things what is it what happens you know and I know I kind of keep asking that over and over again you don't really have the answers and that's it's okay of course how could you we're not in the future I mean I think people really do love to be useful to each other and people love to express their creativity as part of that. And as the long-term trend of society getting richer has continued, more people I think are able to do get closer to sort of expressing themselves in the best way that they can. May maybe like you know as recently as five or six hundred years ago not very many people got to be artists. The world wasn't that rich. There were a limited number of patrons that could like pay you to create art but there were more than zero. And before that there were almost none. And then you got this beautiful Italian Renaissance and all of this amazing art uh because there was like excess capital in the world. And now a lot more people can be artists or a lot more people can start startups which is another like for me that's like my expression of creativity right um or more people can create content. Yeah. Uh and and this idea that people can find whatever way they can to express themselves, their talent, their vision. um for kind of collective love of other people and a care for putting their brick in society's progress. I think that can go really far. Now, what art in the future looks like now that AI can make art or help make art, I don't know. It'll probably be kind of different what startups will look like in the future when people can kind of just say whatever they want to their AI and it can make this off of them, right? Then it will kind of be different. But but I think it's such a bad bet to assume that either human creativity or human fulfillment from being useful to other people ends. I think we're just we stay on this exponential and like each year, each decade, our collective standard of living goes way up. The whole world gets way richer. We all get more. We all expect more. And even over like the course I was thinking recently like food is so much better than it is when I was a kid. Like the world has just figured out how to make food better. Like we, you know, know how to we figured out organic vegetables or whatever it is. I don't know. It just tastes much better. And like I think that's great. I don't want to go back to eating like the frozen carrots or whatever. Yeah, I guess that's a good point. But then there's some like I saw this thing the other day. It was like a K. They had like one of those robo kitchens or whatever. You know when you order food from like something Dash or whatever and then you uh but it's like Hank's ribs and then it's like Marty's Pizza and then it's like Susan's salami shop but they're all the same place, you know? And when you get that from window Dash Yeah. Uh you don't you don't like you feel like something's missing, right? You're like, \"Ah, this is fake. I can tell. I get less enjoyment.\" You would rather get that food from like the dude who's been making it and perfecting it on the, you know, that little pizza shop on the corner for the last 20 years, right? Because that's like part of like that dude is part of the experience. That authenticity is part of the experience. I don't think that goes away with the like fake robotic thing. Okay. Yeah. Because I think I start to feel like we're in this universe where it's like you're walking down the street or something and like a Whimo goes by and it's like eat now and you're like but and you already did eat. It's just got a bad reading or something. It's got a bad valve in it or something. You're like yelling at it. There's nobody in there. And you're like, \"I already ate.\" And it's like, \"Sit down and eat now.\" And it just like [ __ ] uses like a t-shirt cannon to just like shoot a burrito at you. And then you're sitting there, you're eating that, you know? And then the GLP car goes by, right? It says, \"I can help you out.\" Yes. And it's like obviously you've overe and you're like, \"I didn't even want to eat. That thing's messed up, right? You're yelling at a car that has no driver in it.\" And then it shoots you with three GLP1 darts in the neck. And now your wife don't even recognize you when you get home or whatever. You know, the fact that you find this so off-putting, I think is a sign for optimism. Yeah. Like a good point. You're wired. You're going to be resistant to that. That's not going to make you happy. That's not going to make other people happy. Now, maybe we get tricked. Like social media tricked us for a while. We got too addicted to feeds, whatever. But we realized like actually this is not helping me be my best. you know, like doing the equivalent of getting the like burrito cannon into my mouth on my phone at night, like that's not making me long-term happy, right? And that's not helping me like really accomplish my true goals in life. And I think if AI does that, people will reject it. However, if Chhat GBT really helps you to figure out what your true goals in life are and then accomplish those, you know, it says, \"Hey, you've said you want to be a better father or a better, you know, you want to be in better shape or you, you know, want to like grow your business. Um, if you want, we can change that goal and I can help you scroll TikTok all night or, you know, eat the burritos or whatever and I'll give you the GLP1 shots and I'll make you as healthy as you can. But like maybe instead I can try to help convince you you should go for a run tonight.\" M and I think if AI feels like it is helping you try to accomplish your goals and be your best that will feel very different than the last generation of technology. Yeah. And you know what and that's where I'm like and that's where a kid growing up right now to them that would probably some young people might be like that makes the most sense. I'm a little older generation might be like oh that seems a little but that's always how things are generation to generation. Always how it goes. Yeah you're right. And maybe this is just like a quicker evolution of things and for young people it's going to make so much sense and for older people it's and you're just going to be like get off my you know avatar lawn or something you know. Um but that's the way of societal progress. That's just how it goes. Good point. You know it's an interesting time for business. Tariff and trade policies are dynamic. Supply chains are squeezed.

Um there's there's definitely been a lot of talk about like tech and governance, right? And I know we touched on it a little bit earlier. Um, and there were people like lobbying in the uh in Trump had a big beautiful bill for like a 10-year ban on uh state legislation against AI. Um, what do you think about that? Like letting it be this rogue space. There have to be some rules here. There has to be some like guidelines. There has to be some sort of regulation at some point. I think it'd be a mistake to let each state do this kind of crazy patchwork of stuff. I think like one countrywide approach would be much easier for us to be able to innovate and still like have some guardrails, but there have to be some guardrails. Do you have you met with governments and like government leaders to have discussions like that? Like are they meeting with you because they might they Yeah. Yeah, they do meet with us. They haven't done anything big yet, but they're talking about it. Do they meet with you to try to keep information out of um you guys' data? we, you know, for all of the paranoia about that, I don't think we've ever had someone come say like, I don't want it to say this negative thing about this politician or this whatever. Uh the the concerns are like, what is this going to do to our kids? You know, are they going to stop learning? There's a lot of concerns about that. Um is this going to spread fake information? Is this going to influence elections? But we've never had the like you can't say bad things about the president, Trump, or whatever. Um, what about bias is a big like they they do want to know like, you know, if it'll say bad things about one candidate, it'll say bad things about the other. Could you guys make it do one or the other? Like can you guys favor the back end or like We totally could. I mean, we don't, but we totally could. You could. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. I think like I How do we know you How do you like do we give you guys lie detector tests? Like how do we know? We have to like test the system. I mean, you can anyone can like test the AI and say if I say this, does it say this? If I say that. Oh, that's a good point. But you you touch on a really big point here which is like hundreds of millions of people talk to ChachiBT every day and it probably has like a big impact on what they believe and so I think society's interest in making sure that we are you know a responsible neutral party should be huge. Now people do test it a lot and I think that's good but like we got to be held to a very high standard there. But how do we like just as regular people or how do like regular people just hold you guys to a high standard? Like is it the I guess it's politicians responsibility or I mean these guys are idiots on their like 80year-old dudes giving thumbs up. That one guy couldn't get the Wi-Fi on. Remember that guy? That guy couldn't get the Wi-Fi on. So I'm like how do we I mean there's a huge amount of people that test our systems all the time looking for any errors, any bias, any anything. I guess that's a good point is we can test this. You can tell. Yeah. Right. people can test it on this end. Um, as as AI grows, like how big do data centers need to be? Is that a concern of you guys? I went recently to one of our new data centers under construction in Abene, Texas. This is about like a approximately 1 gawatt facility. Huge. You know, it'll be the biggest data center ever built by the time it's done. And you stand in the middle of that and the scale of this project just hits you. so big. That's like one little That's like one little part of it, dude. That's like eight Costco. Uh, you know, there's like 5,000 people there doing construction on it and this thing is just standing up, making progress every day. And you stand in the middle of this. And are you in a chariot or whatever? Like, how do you even You're like in a little ATV. Oh, okay. Uh, it's like a dirty kind of construction site. Um, but it the scale of this thing and then you kind of go in every room and you look at all the cables, the power, the cooling systems, rack after rack after ser of server of servers. It's humongous. There's like they're standing up these like power plants right in the middle of it. There's Oh, yeah. It's crazy. It looks It starts to make our planet look like um a software board, like a It does. You know, when you see it from the air, I was really struck by that. But I was like, \"This looks like the motherboard of a computer.\" Yeah, it looks like the motherboard of a computer. You start to see like how the planets in like a lot of these like uh sci-fi movies, a lot of them look have that R2-D2 look on the outside of them because they've been covered in data centers. Yeah. Which is kind of wild. Do you know where we're going and you're not telling us? Do you I don't I don't. You promise, dude? I don't know. I mean, I have all my guesses. Like I do guess that a lot of the world gets covered in data centers over time. Do you really? But I don't know cuz maybe we put them in space. Like maybe we build a big Dyson sphere on the solar system and say, \"Hey, actually makes no sense to put these on Earth.\" Yeah. I wish I had like more concrete answers for you, but like we're stumbling through this. We maybe, you know, have a little bit higher confidence than the average person or can but there's so much we don't know yet. No, I that's the craziest thing about you, Sam. And and I I think this is a compliment somehow, dear God. And it Yeah, it is a compliment. You're like It's like you're like, \"Come with me through the universe.\" And you're like, people are like, \"What's it like?\" And you're like, \"I don't know exactly, but and then we're all go.\" It's like we're all going. It's like, um, I don't know. You're just somehow the most like uh you're this like this charming kind of terminator. It feels like, and I hate to say Terminator, that's a crazy term, but like uh but you're this like I'm like, \"Okay, I'm curious. You somehow seem so optimistic about it. I'm it it adds to my curiosity.\" When I was a kid, I assumed that there were always some adults in the room. Someone had a plan. Someone knew everything that was going to happen. Someone had it all figured out. And I sort of think why people like conspiracy theories is it's nice to think that someone's got a plan. It's nice to think someone that uh, you know, has it all figured out. And then I got a little bit older and I sort of started to suspect there are no adults in the room. No one People have plans. I have plans, but no one has all the answers. No one knows where it's all going to go. Uh, and now that I am the adult in the room, I can say with certainty, no one knows where it's all going to go. Like, I'm the guy in the room and I have some guesses and I have some plans. Uh, and we're working really hard. But like, you know, we try to always say what we think the possibilities are, what we think is most likely. Often we're right. Sometimes it's in the broader set. And sometimes it goes in a totally different direction than anything we thought. And you know, we keep trying to make progress, figure out more. We try to tell people, not just tell, we try to show people by like deploying these systems and say, \"You can go use it. Don't just take our word for it. Try it out. See what it can do.\" Yeah. Um, but like I can say with conviction, the world needs a lot more processing power. But if that looks like tiling data centers on Earth, which I think is what it looks like in the short term, in the long term also, or we do go build them in space, I don't know. It sounds cool to try to build it in space, but also really hard. What about like the environmental effects of those and stuff? Like there's been like, you know, there's been articles written and I don't know how much of it is real or not real, right? Because who knows what to believe, but you'd have to think that, you know, it takes water to cool them, right? It takes power to power them. You know, um there's some in like Arizona and Iowa that there's been like repercussions within the environments there in the communities. uh what and and a lot of those companies don't have to report those things because it's considered proprietary, you know. Um what do you think about those fears? Um or how do you guys manage that? Like do you guys talk about that? Do you meet with environmentalists? Like what does that all look like? I think we need to get to fusion as fast as possible. Get to what? Nuclear fusion. Uh I think that is the Oh [ __ ] What is it? where you basically knock two small atoms together and it makes a bunch of energy but no carbon, very clean, doesn't generate, you know, doesn't really harm the environment and power can become like abundant and pretty limitless on Earth and we get out of all the current problems we're in. Are you guys investing in that? We are and I think AI can help us figure it out even faster. So that's like a, you know, if you have to like burn a little bit more gas in the short term, but you figure out, you know, the future of energy with that AI, it's a huge win. And would you guys sell tickets to that or what do you think that would be like? Yeah, I think we are going to watch that [ __ ] I mean, yeah, people go to monster trucks. You don't think they'll roll up to watch those two things hit each other? The atoms hit each other. It's pretty hard to watch two atoms hit each other, but maybe with the, you know, somehow we can do it. Or what if they did like those sperm races where they put them under those big things or whatever? I love those sperm races. Kind of crazy. I I'm like, dude, there's enough of that going on. Look, I think the uh Yeah, there will be some way to watch Fusion. And it'll be awesome and it'll be like loud and bright and theatrical and it'll be making huge amounts of energy. Um even if you can't watch the two atoms hit, you'll watch them collectively produce a fireworks. Um but we're going to need that. Do you think if we're going to get to I think so. If we're going to get to uh AGI or or if we're going to get to super intelligence, do we need that? I bet we can get there without it. But to provide it at the scale that humanity will demand it, I think we do need it because people the the the desire to use this stuff, people are just going to want more and more and more. And eventually like the the two things that I think matter most, the two kind of critical inputs are intelligence and energy. The ability to like have great ideas, come up with plans and then energy is the ability to like make them happen in the world and also to run the intelligence. And I think the story of the next couple of decades is going to be that demand for these goes up and up and up to crazy heights. And we better find out how to produce a lot. Otherwise, someone's going to feel like they're getting screwed. Yeah. Dang, dude. I can't tell if I'm excited or scared. Maybe I'm both. And maybe it's all the same. You have to be both. You have to be both. I don't know if it's the same thing or not. I think it is kind of like they do feel related to me always. Um, but I don't think anyone could honestly look at the trajectory humanity is on and not feel both excited and scared. Yeah. And maybe that's always been the way throughout time. And also then this is where we are. What are we going what are you going to do? You know, like this is where we are. And so that's what's going on. Um, I I saw where you and Joe Rogan spoke about there possibly being one day like an AI president, you know, where like what if you had this one kind of let's just use the term supercomputer or this agent that was created that knew all the information and knew all of the problems and knew the best ways to solve them. Um, I is that do you think that something like that is becoming more and more possible one day? I don't know everything that it takes to be a president, but I do know it like takes a lot of things that I don't have to do and that that people are going to well maybe I could reframe it to an AI CEO of OpenAI because I do know what that job is like. Okay, that should be possible someday. Maybe not even that far. Like I think the idea to look at an organization to make really good decisions, there's a lot of things you can imagine that an AI CEO of OpenAI could do that I can't I can't talk to every person at OpenAI every day. I can't talk to every user of CHACHT every day. Um I cannot synthesize all that information even if I could. But an AI CEO could do that and it would have better information, more context. It could, you know, massively parallelize this. And I think that would lead to better decisions in many cases. Yeah. Because wouldn't a supercomputer something that has all knowledge, which you think we'll get there? I do. You do. Or I mean all knowledge is a hard thing to say. I think it will have vast vast amounts. Will it be able to tell us about God or anything? Do you think? I'm super curious about that. Uh, I think it will be able to help us answer questions about the nature of the universe that we currently can't. And I feel very confused and very unsatisfied with our current answers. And there is clearly, to me at least, something going on well beyond our current capability to understand. And I would love to know what that is. Do you think it could help us learn more? Yes. Would it does I wonder if God has a chat GBT or whatever or just wonder he got he has the first one or whatever. But yeah, I'm just so curious like how would that work? Um how does how does Open AI make money? We sell Chacht. You pay 20 bucks a month. Some people pay 200, but very few or relatively few perverts. I think they are uh mostly hopefully they're just working super hard and using it for to be more productive at their job. And then we also sell an API so businesses can use and they like pay us every time they make an API call. Okay. Um do you think uh like there's a lot of these like kind of tech lords that are rocking right now, right? And you get thrown in there, you know, sometimes I'm like on the periphery. Yeah. Yeah. Or you get certainly like Yeah. like these council these councilmen kind of like do you think there's bad artists um amongst like these tech lords in these in these AI realms? Do you think there's bad artists out there? What does bad artist mean? Just like people that want for evil and not for good. I think most people don't wake up I think very few people wake up every morning saying I'm going to try to make the world a worse place or I'm going to actively try to do evil. Clearly some do, but I think most of these people running the big tech efforts are not in that category. I think people get blinded by ambition. I think people get blinded by competition. I think people get caught up like very well-meaning people can get caught up in very negative incentives. Negative for society as a whole. Um, and by the way, I include I include us in this. Like we can totally get caught up in we can be very well-meaning but get caught up in some incentive and it can lead to a bad outcome. Um, so that's kind of what I would say. I think people come in with good intentions. They clearly sometimes do bad stuff. There's a lot of talk about like Palunteer and Peter Teal and their company about being like a um, you know, they got a deal with from Trump about to have this surveillance or not a surveillance state, but to create a database on most of uh, America, but I it starts to feel like a surveillance state, you know. Um, do you feel like we will need something like that in order for uh the future? You know, do you feel like something like that is included in the future? So, I don't know about that specifically. I I mean, I think Palanteer and Peter do a lot of great stuff. Uh, but I again, I can't comment on this specifically. I'll say generally I am worried that the more AI in the world we have the more surveillance the world is going to want cuz the tools so powerful the government will say like how do we know people aren't using it to make bombs or bioweapons or whatever and the answer will be more surveillance and I'm very afraid of that. So I don't I think we really have to defend rights to privacy. I don't think those are absolute. I'm like totally willing to compromise some privacy for collective safety, but history is that the government takes that way too far and I'm really nervous about that. Do you guys feel like the new government kind of or do you feel like the government is still like a real thing? I don't feel like the government anyway. You don't? when the US government bombed Iran recently. I remember waking up that morning and seeing that news or whatever time it was. Uh, and I was like, \"Oh, that's what actual power looks like.\" You know, that we're in like a maybe someday we get there. But it was like a really stark reminder of however important we think this is. It's like there are people that have just like this unimaginable power and might and can kind of do whatever they want. And that's definitely not us. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's been a lot in the Middle East recently is just like it's just such a gross displays over there sometimes of inhumity. Absolutely. It's sad. Um what do you think a guy like then like Palanteer or Peter Teal's endgame is? Do you think he has an endgame? Because I think he seems like a dark lord to a lot of us and it's like he does you think he has an endgame that is like happy? I think Peter is one of the most brilliant people I've ever met. Uh I think Oh, he's smarter than me. That's for sure. I think he does get characterized in the media as this like evil mastermind as a villain. He does. I never met him. I met him. I We're very close friends. Uh I I should have brought it up then. No, it's all good. No, no, no, no. It's all good. I I I don't feel that energy from him, but I at all like I in fact I think he's been one of the most important forces at least in my life for questioning assumptions about the path that society was on and maybe I was like oh I thought this was all going well but maybe we are in a tax stagnation and maybe we really do have this huge economic challenge that no one's talking about and and so I think these people who are just very that think very differently. He would call it very contrarian is super important to a society. Now on the other hand um you know maybe he um maybe he sometimes does things like this that don't do him any favors when it you would prefer the human race to endure, right? Uh, you're hesitant. Well, I Yes. I don't know. I I would I would um This is a long hesitation. So many longesitation. There's so many questions and should the human race survive? Uh, yes. Okay. But, but God, I mean, 22 seconds it took him. Yeah. So if he were if he were maybe like a more typical person, he would have just said an immediate yes and then said what else he wanted to say. And it took me a while with him to understand that his brain just works differently. And society needs some of that. Like he has these super different takes and then he doesn't have maybe the circuit in his brain that makes him immediately say yes and then say what he was going to say. But you know his processors. Yeah. I'm very grateful he exists because he thinks of things no one else does. Yeah, I you know, yeah, you have you want there novel thinkers have changed things throughout time. Sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse, sometimes for the indifferent, but novel thinkers have have you've always like I don't know, it's always been part of humanity. I'm probably super different and super weird relative to most people, but you know, maybe I have some ideas as part of that that are like valuable to society collectively. And if I had this sort of very standard mindset, I wouldn't. That's a good point. Yeah. Well, do you think, and I'm just going to ask you, bro, honestly, do you think a lot of these guys have I mean, you know, it's not like, you know, Love on the Spectrum is like a big show, right? People, you know, it's like, and those people are in love [ __ ] Every half people I know are just, you know, barely, you know, they're crying in parking lots or whatever. But, um, you know, their spousal issues, whatever. But anyway, what I'm saying is, do you think that uh some of the creators now and some of the the tech lords are almost have some tech built into them? Like almost a I don't want to say like an autism, dude, cuz you couldn't say that. Okay. I think so. I mean, yeah. I I you know, to take the kind of like harshest look at us collectively, I can, you know, are we a little autistic on the whole? I I would say probably. Okay, dude. I knew that [ __ ] But that's all right. No, no, that's what I'm saying. years ago I was meet first time I ever met some people with autism I was like dude these guys are computers right like a lot of these guys are just you know they're some they're kind of like a little bit of a cyborg in some way in the way that they think right you know look I'm you are this like impossibly charming cool guy and I'm like kind of a lot more computery than you not much though we can have it we can still like figure it out yeah and I I really don't mean as an offense but I think that we may need that in people to get whatever's next in the world you You think that's realistic? Yeah. I think society needs like this very broad diversity of people. You need some people like me. You need some people who are more normal than me. You don't want too many of me. But like Yeah. Yeah. You don't want too many of anyone thing. Yeah. Yeah. I'm just always I'm like, \"God, yeah, these people are able to see things differently and quantify things differently.\" Do you always feel because some tech guys are they just have a different understanding of possibility, right? A different understanding of feeling and thing. Do you feel human all the time? I do feel human all the time, but I feel like I I have noticed that I think extremely differently about the future, about exponential change, about compounding technology than than almost anybody else that I kind of come across in regular life. So that's cool. I feel extremely human. I feel like, you know, driven by crazy emotions as much as anybody. But I am like very aware that I have a different lens than a lot of people. Have you met some people in tech space and you're like, \"Whoa, that guy is only like six or seven%. He's low. He not a lot of human in it.\" Yes. Yeah. Okay. Um, do you think it's inevitable that AI or AGI will merge into our bodies? I know you've talked about this before in the past. As things go along and advance quickly, do you start to see that a little bit differently? I know you've talked about how you don't think it's like a glasses thing or something like that. I'll tell you a fascinating story. Okay. I was with a friend last week and did I offend you by asking you that? Not at all. I thought that was a great answer and I really appreciate it because yeah, some of us are we can't conceptualize sometimes how you guys are thinking. It can't I I can't even like we feel like we can't figure it out, you know? So, it feels like it's almost like a unique it's like are we all evolving into this new kind of species and that's where we meet the future at anyway and you're just like the dang Paul River out there, you It's like for better or for worse, it's I think whenever you see someone who thinks differently than you, it's like like I'm fascinated by you. I don't quite understand how you do your thing. I know I couldn't do it. I know you like just understand the world differently than me, but I think that's cool and I'm just like all right, I'm glad. Yeah, that's how I feel. I think it's just thanks for just talking to me about it cuz sometimes I think I get afraid to say that. I don't think I don't think you should be afraid. I don't think anybody would be offended by that. Um, I was talking to this friend of mine though about how he uses CHBT and he's been using it a lot for a couple years now and he noticed recently that he start he started giving it personality tests. He'd upload any personality test he could find to Chachib and say based on what you know about me, answer this. And he had never he had never like told it here's my personality. it had just learned it from the questions he asked over the years and on everyone he tried it got exactly the answer and the exactly the outcome he would get and so that's not like he didn't get uploaded he didn't get merged he didn't plug something into his brain but somehow like the pattern of him had gotten imprinted into this AI wow maybe we're not as complex as we think we are or maybe we are and AI can just learn it really well AI can like represent these very complex things. One of those two. But that was a real moment for me of like, wow, you know, the merge maybe can happen in a very different way than we thought. Yeah. Yeah. Because you think of it as this thing kind of taking over your system and like, you know, your dad presses a button and you can't use the car, you know, you can't move for a month or whatever. Yeah. I think it it kind of has that sort of energy. Um, you just you just finished the acquisition of this a little bit more like day-to-day business. You just finished the acquisition of Johnny Ives um hardware company um their hardware company. So clearly you have some like thoughts or interest in how like hardware and AI match up for each other in humanity. What was that about? There have been two revolutions in computers in history. There was the keyboard, mouse and screen. that thing that was invented down the street in I think the 70s uh where you know the people at Xerox Park figured out what has become the modern computer interface and then in the early to mid the early 2000s I guess Apple figured out this idea of touch on a device and really those have been the two big ones. I think now there can be a third. I think AI is it so changes the game that you can design a new kind of computer based off of a really smart AI where you can give a complex instruction to a system. It can go do it. You'll trust that it gets it right. You'll trust it to act on your behalf. It could like maybe be aware of everything going on in this room and it could like kind of not just be on or off but like lightly get our attention if it wants us to know something or maybe more aggressively get our attention. It could really be like following what we're talking about here and remind us both of things later. Um, and current hardware just can't do that. The current kind of computers we have, I don't think are a fair, they don't honor what the technology is not really capable of. So, I want to make a totally new kind of computer that isn't meant for this world of AI helping you all the time. I'm super excited about it. You are? Yeah. Um, I you guys this thing called agent that you guys had showed me earlier. I can take this out if I mention it. I wasn't supposed to. It was pretty fascinating. It was cool to see it. It is. Yeah. This This is a new thing that we just did. Um, but the idea that an AI can not just answer questions for you, but it can go actually do stuff on your behalf as your agent. It can go do research for you. It can go book something for you. It can go buy something for you. It can go like, you know, change some things in the world for you and think more and use tools. Like I think most people think of ChachiBT as this app that you can ask anything, but it'll become this thing that can do anything and that'll change how you use computers. It'll change how you do things in your life, you know, if you Yeah, I was watching the guy do it and it was just kind of fascinating. He was showing like one time he'd went to like a website and bought something that he needed. And then now moving forward, he could just be like, \"Hey, go to this and make sure to get me these or go to uh go here and see go to the restaurants I like and see if there's any table available for 7:00 p.m. tomorrow.\" And it was able to book it and do everything. It was like having a secretary right there. It totally when I first started using it, I was like, it was one of those moments where I could tell that, oh man, doing this the oldfashioned way is going to feel like the stone age so quickly. M you know I'm going to like try to tell people someday like do you remember when if we wanted to do something we actually had to go like click around the internet and like you know look for a table and then if we wanted to move it we had to like call the restaurant and that's going to be unimaginable because of course you just tell your AI to do those things for you. Yeah. Yeah. You feel like you would almost just tell it to go eat too you know that's the fun part. Yeah. Oh yeah. That's No one likes booking the table. Everyone loves sitting there eating. That's a good point. Huh. Yeah. Yeah. It won't take away the fun part. That's the thing I think you got to remember that it won't take away the fun part. You're going to do the things you want to do. There's a lot of things in your life you probably don't love doing. Like booking an open table is maybe one of them. Yeah. And then you'll have like oldfashioned be like I'll book it. You know, you're like, \"Dad, what do you mean? Get off the phone or whatever. Don't call him you freaking weirdo. Use a freaking use your agent.\" Totally. Like I'll book it. Um there's there's like a lot of like you know Zuckerberg recently like kind of was poaching guys around town, right? And I'll say it, you don't have to say it. allegedly. I'm not saying he did. He hired one of my buddies. But what I'm saying is um there's this hypothetical that he was like kind of poaching guys around town. Is that did it did that feel like a mafioso move in the community? What was that like out here on out here in the uh tech trenches? I mean, you know, they want to get into the AI game. I understand it. So, and if he's going to do this, he needs to hire some people. So, bring it. So, bring it. So, bring it. Yeah. [ __ ] yeah, dude. I'm gonna upload myself into this plant in a second. Okay. No, but no. Does it do you kind of like the competition? Is that fun? It is to It's Yeah, compet Like winning is fun. Yeah. And I expect to win. And you got to love the compet. That's part of it, right? It makes it fun. I think what it would be like if we didn't have competition and drama in the world. It would be so boring. Could uh actually, can I say one more thing about that? the best improvement I made in my life in my like personally in my life and for my own happiness over the last couple years. A lot of bad [ __ ] has happened to us. To me, it's been like a crazy intense experience. And I just decided that I was going to like learn to love the hard parts. I was like, you know what? If I'm in this crazy moment, if I'm in this like crazy thing, if I like feel my emotions are high, I'm going to like make myself learn to be grateful for that, to love it, to find enjoyment in the in the tension, in the competition, whatever. And actually it worked and it it kind of needed to work cuz like so many things go wrong in any given day. But I was like thinking about you know someday I'll be like retired on my ranch. I'll be sitting there watching the plants grow and I'll be missing the excitement and the drama and the anger and the tension and the whatever. And so I'm going to be like grateful for it and like learn to have fun with it. And now it like I cannot believe that that mind shift mindset shift worked but it did. And were there practices like in a moment like say like a moment came up like some of the early ones, right? Because I agree with you that like having some mindset like I used to hate traveling like every week traveling for work but then one day I was like dude you have to travel for work. Deal with it. You may as well find you may as well [ __ ] cuz for years you've been just and right there suddenly it wasn't bad anymore. That happened for me too. Was there like a just a practice or was it just this verbal reminder like I'm going to do this. I just kept saying it to myself. I was just like someday you'll miss these moments. you may as well find a way to like find the happiness and kind of great gratitude for them in the moment. Yeah. Um, a lot of these guys have bunkers. Zucky has a bunky. I know that somewhere out in Hawaii. People have bunkers. Do you have a bunker? I have like underground concrete heavy reinforced basements, but I don't have anything I would call Hold on, hold on, hold on, dude. Look, I'll let you I'll let you keep me on the ropes in a lot of this conversation, but I am going to call that out as a dang bunker, dude. Sam, that's a bunker. Wasn't there a basement in a bunker? A one a place you could hide when it all goes off or whatever. I No. Yeah, I have been thinking I should really do a good version of one of those, but I don't I don't have like a I don't have what I would call a bunker, but it has been on my mind. Not because of AI, but just because of like people are dropping bombs in the world again. And you know, like That's a good point. That's a very good point. Yeah. Basin right there. Part of a house building typically used for storage, laundry, extra living, space, or utilities. And then bunker built for protection. Often military or emergency related myth meant to withstand explosions. We don't have that yet. Do you guys do this just for me or do you use chatbt as the fact check? We did this just for you. I appreciate it. Um, this is nice. If could we ever could we ever have instead of so you start to see say if AI comes over and there's this whole new kind of like um you know I believe that one of the things that's been happening there's been like a lot of like ICE raids and people getting like taken out of their homes and um uh you know um there's been a lot of crackdown cuz part of me believes that they're having to get everybody documented or online basically because they're going to start to have this p like uh this like facial recognition everywhere. Like I have this idea of that. So yes, this stuff had to happen because in in a year or year and a half you wouldn't even be able to be outdoors anywhere anywhere without a drone or something noticing you or some camera noticing that you're not supposed to be there or you're not there with documentation, right? Whatever people's thoughts are on that. But just so part of me starts to see like, oh, okay, that's going on. Do you think we could ever then down the line have new countries like delineated by like almost like a new AI landscape? Like remember when on Snapchat if you were in a certain realm you could put like a filter on something and they almost created these new like glo like geo barriers and stuff. Do you think we could potentially be looking at something like that one day? I I know that what you just said is going to happen. I know that we're going to have like cameras on, you know, all over the place and it's going to make the cities way safer because everybody like if you commit a crime, they'll have like a facial recognition hit on you right away. But man, do I find that dystopic? Like you do, of course. Like I, you know, is it like a good trade if it means like people stop getting murdered in the streets? Yeah, sure. We agree to like give up some privacy for that. But it it sits so uncomfortably with me, you know, in like London or whatever. You see those cameras on every street corner and you're just like you get used to it fast. Yeah. But you're just like it feels like privacy is important and and like you you really are like there's nothing I can do to live in the world and avoid all these cameras and maybe it's worth it for society collectively but it it it it feels like we really do give up a lot to get it. But could there one day you think if we had that then we could have whole new countries kind of that were what do you mean by new countries in this case? Like say if there was this new kind of this new like layer right of sur a surveillance layer that's kind of in the in the air then could that be divided into different realms? Oh yes, totally. That can I think there's all kinds of weird ways that that can happen. But but the surveillance layer is so uncomfortable. Oh yeah, it's going to be a nasty blanket. Um is there anything else that you wanted to talk about you wanted to get out that you want me to ask you about? No, that was great. Oh, why are there Why does Chad UBC have that hyphen thing? We we got to do something about that. Um, you know, we have this team that figures out what the model's personality should be like and how it should behave. Mhm. And a lot of users like M dashes, so we added more m dashes. And now I think we have too many M dashes. But that's the answer is it was just like users liked it, we put more in. Now it's like a little bit of a meme and it's kind of it's quite annoying to me. We should we should fix that. But you're thinking about it, too. I think we'll get it fixed very soon. Okay. Uh before you go, Sam, and thank you so much for your time today. It's been awesome. We appreciate it, man. Um, it's helped me get to understand you, I feel like, a lot. I think maybe differently than I I don't know if I had a perception. I didn't know what to think. What's the before and after? Uh, the before was like a little bit like um I guess I almost thought kind of like not as hopeful, but I don't know why. Maybe that's just my own I think it's attaching my own perceptions of what I think about AI and stuff or the possibilities of technology, you know, like that kind of stuff like that energy. I think I was probably attaching it to you and now I feel like like more whimsical about it kind of like um or not whimsical but like let's see what can happen, right? And so I think I think it's not just let's see, it's like let's try to make it good but let's realize that you have to like you don't get to see all the way down the road. You kind of got to go one turn at a time and you like light up a little bit more. Yeah. Yeah. I think Yeah. I don't know. I I just I'm really I'm really thankful for you. Even let me tell you what I thought what what what I was like judging and then uh and then sharing like kind of where I thought what I thought now. Um in 20 years, what do you hope your legacy will be? I you're going to have one. I mean, yeah. I guess I you certainly don't I don't think anyone sits around while they're in like the middle of the game thinking about, you know, what the review is going to be after. At least I don't. Um and but this is a big review you'll have. I have never been that motivated by like what like I want to like play the game the best I can. and I want to like, you know, do the best work I can, have the most fun, have like have the most impact, do the most interesting stuff. But then, you know, you retire and then you die and then like life goes on and people as they're supposed to go on with life and forget about you and this whole thing of like I'm going to live for how I'm remembered after I die and my legacy and like you're dead, you know? Do you have one of those deals where you saving your heart with those people? What do you mean? Your brain, sorry, with the people over there. Cryionics. You have a Cryionic deal? No, I uh Have you been approached about it? I have been approached by it. There was like a That's You haven't even [ __ ] approached me. I haven't asked for anything. There was this like Y company or company that I like helped out a long time ago by like giving some small deposit to and then like I never followed up on it so I don't have anything in place. Okay. But maybe a Yeah, maybe just a down payment somewhere down there. If things get weird, we'll we'll go knock on their door. Um yeah, but thank you so much, man. James Basher says hello. He's a friend of mine. He's a great guy. And uh and we just appreciate you so much, Sam. Thanks for your time. Thanks for thanks for doing this. I really enjoyed it. Thank you for your time today. I thought it was very informative. [Music] And I feel like I must be corner stone. [Music] Oh, but when I reach that ground, I'll share this piece of mind I found. I can feel it in my bones. But it's going to take"

      "transcript": "Chris Anderson: Sam, welcome to TED. Thank you so much for coming. Sam Altman: Thank you. It's an honor. CA: Your company has been releasing crazy insane new models pretty much every other week it feels like. I've been playing with a couple of them. I'd like to show you what I've been playing. So, Sora, this is the image and video generator. I asked Sora this: What will it look like when you share some shocking revelations here at TED? You want to see how it imagined it, you know? (Laughter) I mean, not bad, right? How would you grade that? Five fingers on all hands. SA: Very close to what I'm wearing, you know, it's good. CA: I've never seen you quite that animated. SA: No, I'm not that animated of a person. CA: So maybe a B-plus. But this one genuinely astounded me. When I asked it to come up with a diagram that shows the difference between intelligence and consciousness. Like how would you do that? This is what it did. I mean, this is so simple, but it's incredible. What is the kind of process that would allow -- like this is clearly not just image generation. It's linking into the core intelligences that your overall model has. SA: Yeah, the new image generation model is part of GPT-4o, so it's got all of the intelligence in there. And I think that's one of the reasons it's been able to do these things that people really love. CA: I mean, if I'm a management consultant and I'm playing with some of this stuff, I'm thinking, uh oh, what does my future look like? SA: I mean, I think there are sort of two views you can take. You can say, oh, man, it's doing everything I do. What's going to happen to me? Or you can say, like through every other technological revolution in history, OK, now there's this new tool. I can do a lot more. What am I going to be able to do? It is true that the expectation of what we’ll have for someone in a particular job increases, but the capabilities will increase so dramatically that I think it will be easy to rise to that occasion. CA: So this impressed me too. I asked it to imagine Charlie Brown as thinking of himself as an AI. It came up with this. I thought this was actually rather profound. What do you think? (Laughs) I mean, the writing quality of some of the new models, not just here, but in detail, is really going to a new level. SA: I mean, this is an incredible meta answer, but there's really no way to know if it is thinking that or it just saw that a lot of times in the training set. And of course like if you can’t tell the difference, how much do you care? CA: So that's really interesting. We don't know. Isn't there though ... like at first glance this looks like IP theft. Like you guys don’t have a deal with the “Peanuts” estate? (Applause) You can clap about that all you want, enjoy. (Laughter and murmuring) I will say that I think the creative spirit of humanity is an incredibly important thing, and we want to build tools that lift that up, that make it so that new people can create better art, better content, write better novels that we all enjoy. I believe very deeply that humans will be at the center of that. I also believe that we probably do need to figure out some sort of new model around the economics of creative output. I think people have been building on the creativity of others for a long time. People take inspiration for a long time. But as the access to creativity gets incredibly democratized and people are building off of each other's ideas all the time, I think there are incredible new business models that we and others are excited to explore. Exactly what that's going to look like, I'm not sure. Clearly, there’s some cut and dry stuff, like you can’t copy someone else’s work. But how much inspiration can you take? If you say, I want to generate art in the style of these seven people, all of whom have consented to that, how do you, like divvy up how much money goes to each one? These are like big questions. But every time throughout history we have put better and more powerful technology in the hands of creators. I think we collectively get better creative output and people do just more amazing stuff. CA: An even bigger question is when they haven't consented to it. In our opening session, Carole Cadwalladr, showed, you know, \"ChatGPT give a talk in the style of Carole Cadwalladr\" and sure enough, it gave a talk that wasn't quite as good as the talk she gave, but it was pretty impressive. And she said, \"OK, it's great, but I did not consent to this.\" How are we going to navigate this? Like isn’t there a way, should it just be people who’ve consented? Or shouldn’t there be a model that somehow says that any named individual in a prompt whose work is then used, they should get something for that? SA: So right now, if you use our image-gen thing and say, I want something in the style of a living artist, it won't do that. But if you say I want it in the style of this particular like kind of vibe, or this studio or this art movement or whatever, it will. And obviously if you’re like, you know, output a song that is like a copy of a song, it won't do that. The question of like where that line should be and how people say like, this is too much, we sorted that out before with copyright law and kind of what fair use looks like. Again, I think in the world of AI, there will be a new model that we figure out. CA: From the point of view, I mean, creative people are some of the angriest people right now or the most scared people about AI. And the difference between feeling your work is being stolen from you and your future is being stolen from you, and feeling your work is being amplified and can be amplified, those are such different feelings. And if we could shift to the other one, to the second one, I think that really changes how much humanity as a whole embraces all this. SA: Well, again, I would say some creative people are very upset. Some creatives are like, \"This is the most amazing tool ever, I'm doing incredible new work.\" But you know like it’s definitely a change. And I have a lot of like empathy to people who are just like, \"I wish this change weren't happening. I liked the way things were before.\" CA: But in principle, you can calculate from any given prompt how much ... there should be some way of being able to calculate what percentage of a subscription, revenue or whatever goes towards each answer. In principle, it should be possible if one could get the rest of the rules figured out. It's obviously complicated. You could calculate some kind of revenue share, no? SA: If you're a musician and you spend your whole life, your whole childhood, listening to music, and then you get an idea and you go compose a song that is inspired by what you've heard before, but a new direction, it'd be very hard for you to say like, this much was from this song I heard when I was 11. CA: That's right. But we're talking here about the situation where someone specifically in a prompt names someone. SA: Well, again, right now, if you try to like, go generate an image in a named style, we just say that artist is living, we don't do it. But I think it would be cool to figure out a new model where if you say, I want to do it in the name of this artist and they opt in, there's a revenue model there. I think that's a good thing to explore. CA: So, I think the world should help you figure out that model quickly. And I think it will make a huge difference actually. I want to switch topics quickly. (Applause) The battle between your model and open source. How much were you shaken up by the arrival of DeepSeek? SA: I think open source has an important place. We actually, just last night, hosted our first community session to kind of decide the parameters of our open-source model and how we want to shape it. We're going to do a very powerful open-source model. I think this is important. We're going to do something near the frontier, I think, better than any current open-source model out there. This will not be all -- there will be people who will use this in ways that some people in this room, maybe you or I, don’t like. But there is going to be an important place for open-source models as part of the constellation here. And, you know, I think we were late to act on that, but we're going to do it really well now. CA: I mean, you're spending it seems, like an order, or even orders of magnitude more than DeepSeek allegedly spent, although I know there's controversy around that. Are you confident that the actual better model is going to be recognized? Or are you actually like, isn't this in some ways life-threatening to the notion that, yeah, by going to massive scale, tens of billions of dollars of investment, we can maintain an incredible lead. SA: All day long, I call people and beg them to give us their GPUs. We are so incredibly constrained. Our growth is going like this. DeepSeek launched, and it didn’t seem to impact it. There's other stuff that's happening. CA: Tell us about the growth, actually. You gave me a shocking number backstage there. SA: I have never seen growth in any company, one that I've been involved with or not, like this, like the growth of ChatGPT. It's really fun. I feel like great, deeply honored. But it is crazy to live through, and our teams are exhausted and stressed. And we’re trying to keep things up. CA: How many users do you have now? SA: I think the last time we said was 500 million weekly actives, and it is growing very rapidly. CA: I mean, you told me that like doubled in just a few weeks. Like in terms of compute or in terms of ... SA: I said that privately, but I guess ... CA: Oh. (Laughter) I misremembered, Sam, I'm sorry. We can edit that out of the thing if you really want to. And no one here would tweet it. SA: It's growing very fast. (Laughter) CA: So you're confident, you're seeing it grow, take off like a rocket ship, you're releasing incredible new models all the time. What are you seeing in your best internal models right now that you haven't yet shared with the world but you would love to here on this stage? SA: So first of all, you asked about, are we worried about this model or that model? There will be a lot of intelligent models in the world. Very smart models will be commoditized to some degree. I think we’ll have the best, and for some use you'll want that. But like, honestly, the models are now so smart that for most of the things most people want to do, they're good enough. I hope that'll change over time because people will raise their expectations. But like, if you're kind of using ChatGPT as a standard user, the model capability is very smart. But we have to build a great product, not just a great model. And so there will be a lot of people with great models, and we will try to build the best product. And people want their image-gen, you know, you saw some Sora examples for video earlier. They want to integrate it with all their stuff. We just launched a new feature, it's still called Memory, but it's way better than the Memory before, where this model will get to know you over the course of your lifetime. And we have a lot more stuff to come to build like this great integrated product. And, you know, I think people will stick with that. So there will be many models, but I think we will, I hope, continue to focus on building the best defining product in this space. CA: I mean after I saw your announcement yesterday that ChatGPT will know all of your query history, I entered, \"Tell me about me, ChatGPT, from all you know.\" And my jaw dropped, Sam, it was shocking. It knew who I was and all these sort of interests that hopefully mostly were pretty much appropriate and shareable. But it was astonishing. And I felt the sense of real excitement, a little bit queasy, but mainly excitement, actually, at how much more that would allow it to be useful to me. SA: One of our researchers tweeted, you know, kind of like yesterday or this morning, that the upload happens bit by bit. It’s not you know, that you plug your brain in one day. But you will talk to ChatGPT over the course of your life and some day, maybe if you want, it'll be listening to you throughout the day and sort of observing what you're doing, and it'll get to know you and it'll become this extension of yourself, this companion, this thing that just tries to, like, help you be the best, do the best you can. CA: In the movie \"Her,\" the AI basically announces that she's read all of his emails and decided he's a great writer and you know, persuades a publisher to publish him. That might be coming sooner than we think. SA: I don't think it will happen exactly like that, but yeah, I think something in the direction where AI -- you don’t have to just, like, go to ChatGPT or whatever and say, I have a question, give me an answer. But you're getting like, proactively pushed things that help you, that make you better or whatever. That does seem like it's soon. CA: So what have you seen that's coming up, internally, that you think is going to blow people's minds? Give us at least a hint of what the next big jaw dropper is. SA: The thing that I'm personally most excited about is AI for science at this point. I am a big believer that the most important driver of the world and people's lives getting better and better is new scientific discovery. We can do more things with less, we sort of push back the frontier of what's possible. We're starting to hear a lot from scientists with our latest models that they're actually just more productive than they were before. That's actually mattering to what they can discover. CA: What’s the plausible near-term discovery, like, room temperature -- SA: Superconductors? CA: Superconducting, yeah. Is that possible? SA: I don't think that's prevented by the laws of physics. So it should be possible. But we don't know for sure. I think you'll start to see some ... meaningful progress against disease with AI-assisted tools. You know, physics maybe takes a little bit longer, but I hope for it. So that's like, one direction. Another that I think is big is starting pretty soon, like in the coming months. Software development has already been pretty transformed. Like it’s quite amazing how different the process of creating software is now than it was two years ago. But I expect like another move that big in the coming months as agentic software engineering really starts to happen. CA: I've heard engineers say that they've had almost like religious-like moments with some of the new models where suddenly, they can do in an afternoon what would have taken them two years. SA: Yeah, it's like mind -- it really like, that’s been one of my big “feel the AGI” moments. CA: But talk about what is the scariest thing that you've seen. Because like, outside, a lot of people picture you as, you know, you have access to this stuff. And we hear all these rumors coming out of AI, and it's like, \"Oh my God, they've seen consciousness,\" or \"They've seen AGI,\" or \"They've seen some kind of apocalypse coming.\" Have you seen, has there been a scary moment when you've seen something internally and thought, \"Uh oh, we need to pay attention to this?\" SA: There have been like moments of awe. And I think with that is always like, how far is this going to go? What is this going to be? But there's no like, we don't secretly have, we're not secretly sitting on a conscious model or something that's capable of self-improvement or anything like that. You know, I ... people have very different views of what the big AI risks are going to be. And I myself have like evolved on thinking about where we're going to see those. I continue to believe there will come very powerful models that people can misuse in big ways. People talk a lot about the potential for new kinds of bioterror, models that can present like a real cybersecurity challenge, models that are capable of self-improvement in a way that leads to some sort of loss of control. So I think there are big risks there. And then there's a lot of other stuff, which honestly is kind of what I think, many people mean, where people talk about disinformation or models saying things that they don't like or things like that. CA: Sticking with the first of those, do you check for that internally before release? SA: Of course, yeah. So we have this preparedness framework that outlines how we do that. CA: I mean, you've had some departures from your safety team. How many people have departed, why have they left? SA: We have, I don't know the exact number, but there are clearly different views about AI safety systems. I would really point to our track record. There are people who will say all sorts of things. You know, something like 10 percent of the world uses our systems now a lot. And we are very proud of the safety track record. CA: But track record isn't the issue in a way -- SA: No, it kind of is. CA: Because we're talking about an exponentially growing power where we fear that we may wake up one day and the world is ending. So it's really not about track record, it's about plausibly saying that the pieces are in place to shut things down quickly if we see a danger. SA: Yeah, no, of course, of course that's important. You don't, like, wake up one day and say, \"Hey, we didn't have any safety process in place. Now we think the model is really smart. So now we have to care about safety.\" You have to care about it all along this exponential curve. Of course the stakes increase, and there are big challenges. But the way we learn how to build safe systems is this iterative process of deploying them to the world, getting feedback, while the stakes are relatively low, learning about like, this is something we have to address. And I think as we move into these agentic systems, there's a whole big category of new things we have to learn to address. CA: So let's talk about agentic systems and the relationship between that and AGI. I think there's confusion out there, I'm confused. So artificial general intelligence, it feels like ChatGPT is already a general intelligence. I can ask it about anything, and it comes back with an intelligent answer. Why isn't that AGI? SA: It doesn't ... First of all, you can't ask it anything. That's very nice of you to say, but there's a lot of things that it's still embarrassingly bad at. But even if we fixed those, which hopefully we will, it doesn't continuously learn and improve. It can't go get better at something that it's currently weak at. It can't go discover new science and update its understanding and do that. And it also kind of can't, even if we lower the bar, it can't just sort of do any knowledge work you could do in front of a computer. I actually, even without the sort of ability to get better at something it doesn't know yet, I might accept that as a definition of AGI. But the current systems, you can't say like, hey, go do this task for my job, and it goes off and clicks around the internet and calls someone and looks at your files and does it. And without that, it feels definitely short of it. CA: I mean, do you guys have internally a clear definition of what AGI is, and when do you think that we may be there? SA: It's like the joke, if you’ve got 10 OpenAI researchers in a room and ask to define AGI, you’d get 14 definitions. CA: That's worrying, though, isn't it? Because that has been the mission initially, “We’re going to be the first to get to AGI. We'll do so safely. But we don't have a clear definition of what it is.\" SA: I was going to finish the answer. CA: Sorry. SA: What I think matters though, and what people want to know is not where is this one, you know, magic moment of, “We finished.” But given that what looks like is going to happen is that the models are just going to get smarter and more capable and smarter and more capable, on this long exponential, different people will call it AGI at different points. But we all agree it’s going to go way, way past that. You know, to whatever you want to call these systems that get much more capable than we are. The thing that matters is how do we talk about a system that is safe through all of these steps and beyond, as the system gets more capable than we are, as the system can do things that we don't totally understand. And I think more important than when is AGI coming and what's the definition of it, it's recognizing that we are in this unbelievable exponential curve. And you can, you know, say this is what I think AGI is. You can say you think this is what you think AGI is. Someone else can say superintelligence is out here, but we're going to have to contend and get wonderful benefits from this incredible system. And so I think we should shift the conversation away from what's the AGI moment to a recognition that, like, this thing is not going to stop, it's going to go way beyond what any of us would call AGI. And we have to build a society to get the tremendous benefits of this and figure out how to make it safe. CA: Well, one of the conversations this week has been that the real change moment is -- I mean, AGI is a fuzzy thing, but what is clear is agentic AI -- when AI is set free to pursue projects on its own and to put the pieces together -- you’ve actually, you've got a thing called Operator which starts to do this. And I tried it out. You know, I wanted to book a restaurant, and it's kind of incredible. It kind of can go ahead and do it, but this is what it said. You know, it was an intriguing process. And, you know, “Give me your credit card” and everything else, and I declined on this case to go forward. But I think this is the challenge that people are going to have. It's kind of like, it's an incredible superpower. It's a little bit scary. And Yoshua Bengio, when he spoke here, said that agentic AI is the thing to pay attention to. This is when everything could go wrong as we give power to AI to go out onto the internet to do stuff. I mean, going out onto the internet was always, in the sci-fi stories, the moment where, you know, escape happened and potential -- things could go horribly wrong. How do you both release agentic AI and have guardrails in place that it doesn't go too far? SA: First of all, obviously you can choose not to do this and say, I don't want this. I'm going to call the restaurant and read them my credit card over the phone. CA: I could choose, but someone else might say, “Oh, go out, ChatGPT onto the internet at large and rewrite the internet to make it better for humans,” or whatever. SA: The point I was going to make is just with any new technology, it takes a while for people to get comfortable. I remember when I wouldn't put my credit card on the internet because my parents had convinced me someone was going to read the number, and you had to fill out the form and then call them. And then we kind of all said, OK, we’ll build anti-fraud systems, and we can get comfortable with this. I think people are going to be slow to get comfortable with agentic AI in many ways. But I also really agree with what you said, which is that even if some people are comfortable with it and some aren't, we are going to have AI systems clicking around the internet. And this is, I think, the most interesting and consequential safety challenge we have yet faced. Because AI that you give access to your systems, your information, your ability to click around on your computer, now, those, you know, when AI makes a mistake, it's much higher stakes. It is the gate on -- so we talked earlier about safety and capability. I kind of think they're increasingly becoming one-dimensional. Like a good product is a safe product. You will not use our agents if you do not trust that they’re not going to like empty your bank account or delete your data or who knows what else. And so people want to use agents that they can really trust, that are really safe. And I think we are gated on our ability to make progress on our ability to do that. But it's a fundamental part of the product. CA: In a world where agency is out there and say that, you know, maybe it’s open models are widely distributed and someone says, \"OK, AGI, I want you to go out onto the internet and, you know, spread a meme however you can that X people are evil,” or whatever it is. It doesn't have to be an individual choice. A single person could let that agent out there, and the agent could decide, \"Well, in order to execute on that function, I've got to copy myself everywhere,\" and, you know. Are there red lines that you have clearly drawn internally, where you know what the danger moments are, and that we cannot put out something that could go beyond this? SA: Yeah, so this is the purpose of our preparedness framework. And we'll update that over time. But we’ve tried to outline where we think the most important danger moments are, or what the categories are, how we measure that, and how we would mitigate something before releasing it. I can tell from the conversation you're not a big AI fan. CA: Actually, on the contrary, I use it every day. I'm awed by it. I think this is an incredible time to be alive. I wouldn't be alive any other time, and I cannot wait to see where it goes. We've been holding ... I think it's essential to hold ... like we can’t divide people into those camps. You have to hold a passionate belief in the possibility, but not be overseduced by it because things could go horribly wrong. (Applause) SA: What I was going to say is I totally understand that. I totally understand looking at this and saying this is an unbelievable change coming to the world. And, you know, maybe I don't want this, or maybe I love parts of it. Maybe I love talking to ChatGPT, but I worry about what's going to happen to art, and I worry about the pace of change, and I worry about these agents clicking around the internet. And maybe, on balance, I wish this weren't happening. Or maybe I wish it were happening a little slower. Or maybe I wish it were happening in a way where I could pick and choose what parts of progress were going to happen. And I think, the fear is totally rational. Sort of, the anxiety is totally rational. We all have a lot of it, too. But ... A, there will be tremendous upside. Obviously, you know, you use it every day, you like it. B ... I really believe that society figures out, over time, with some big mistakes along the way, how to get technology right. And C, this is going to happen. This is like a discovery of fundamental physics that the world now knows about. And it's going to be part of our world. And I think this conversation is really important. I think talking about these areas of danger [is] really important to talk about. New economic models are really important. But we have to embrace this with like, caution but not fear, or we will get run by with other people that use AI to do better. CA: You've actually been one of the most eloquent proponents of safety. You testified in the Senate. I think you said basically that we should form a new safety agency that licenses any effort, ie. it will refuse to license certain efforts. Do you still believe in that policy proposal? SA: I have learned more about how the government works. I don't think this is quite the right policy proposal. CA: What is the right policy proposal? SA: But, I do think the idea that as these systems get more advanced and have legitimate global impact, we need some way, you know, maybe the companies themselves put together the right framework or the right sort of model for this, but we need some way that very advanced models have external safety testing. And we understand when we get close to some of these danger zones. I very much still believe in that. CA: Struck me as ironic that a safety agency might be what we want, and yet agency is the very thing that is unsafe. There's something odd about the language there, but anyway. SA: Can I say one more thing on that? I do think this concept of we need to define rigorous testing for models, understand what the threats that we, collectively, society, most want to focus on, and make sure that as models are getting more capable, we have a system where we all get to understand what's being released in the world. I think this is really important. And I think we’re not far away from models that are going to be of great public interest in that sense. CA: So Sam, I asked your o1-pro reasoning model, which is incredibly -- SA: Thank you for the 200 dollars. CA: (Laughs) 200 dollars a month. It's a bargain at the price. I said, what is the single most penetrating question I could ask you? It thought about it for two minutes. Two minutes. You want to see the question? SA: I do. CA: \"Sam, given that you're helping create technology that could reshape the destiny of our entire species, who granted you (or anyone) the moral authority to do that?” (Laughter) \"And how are you personally accountable if you're wrong?\" SA: No, it was good. CA: That was impressive. SA: You've been asking me versions of this for the last half hour. What do you think? (Laughter and applause) CA: What I would say is this. Here's my version of that question. SA: But no answer? CA: What was your question to me? SA: How would you answer that one? CA: In your shoes? SA: Or as an outsider. CA: I don't know. I am puzzled by you. I’m kind of awed by you. Because you’ve built one of the most astonishing things out there. There are two narratives about you out there. One is, you know, you are this incredible visionary who's done the impossible, and you shocked the world. With far fewer people than Google, you came out with something that was much more powerful than anything being done. I mean, it is amazing what you've built. But the other narrative is that you have shifted ground, that you've shifted from being OpenAI, this open thing, to the allure of building something super powerful. And you know, you’ve lost some of your key people. There's a narrative out there. Some people believe that you're not to be trusted in this space. I would love to know who you are. What is your narrative about yourself? What are your core values, Sam, that can give us, the world, confidence that someone with so much power here is entitled to it? SA: Look, I think like anyone else, I'm a nuanced character that doesn't reduce well to one dimension here. You know, probably some of the good things are true and probably some of the criticism is true. In terms of OpenAI, our goal is to make AGI and distribute it, make it safe, for the broad benefit of humanity. I think by all accounts, we have done a lot in that direction. Clearly our tactics have shifted over time. I think we didn't really know what we were going to be when we grew up. We didn't think we would have to build a company around this. We learned a lot about how it goes and the realities of what these systems were going to take from capital. But I think we've been, in terms of putting incredibly capable AI with a high degree of safety in the hands of a lot of people, and giving them tools to sort of do whatever amazing things they're going to do, I think it'd be hard to give us a bad grade on that. I do think it's fair that we should be open sourcing more. I think it was reasonable for all of the reasons that you asked earlier, as we weren't sure about the impact these systems were going to have and how to make them safe, that we acted with precaution. I think a lot of your questions earlier would suggest at least some sympathy to the fact that we've operated that way. But now I think we have a better understanding, as a world, and it is time for us to put very capable open systems out into the world. If you invite me back next year, you will probably yell at me for somebody who has misused these open-source systems, and say, \"Why did you do that?\" You know, \"You should have not gone back to your open roots.\" But, you know, there's trade offs in everything we do. And we are one player, one voice, in this AI revolution, trying to do the best we can and kind of steward this technology into the world in a responsible way. We've definitely made mistakes, we'll definitely make more in the future. On the whole, I think we have, over the last almost decade, it’s been a long time now, you know, we have mostly done the thing we’ve set out to do. We have a long way to go in front of us. Our tactics will shift more in the future, but adherence to this sort of mission and what we're trying to do, I think very strong. (Applause) CA: You posted this -- Well, OK, so here's the Ring of Power from \"Lord of the rings.\" Your rival, I will say, not your best friend at the moment, Elon Musk, claimed that, you know, he thought that you'd been corrupted by the Ring of Power. An allegation that, by the way -- (Laughter) SA: Hi, Steve. CA: An allegation that could be applied to Elon as well, you know, to be fair. But I'm curious, people, you have -- SA: I might respond. I'm thinking about it. I might say something. (Laughter) CA: It's in everyone's mind, as we see technology CEOs get more powerful, get richer, is can they handle it, or does it become irresistible? Does the power and the wealth make it impossible to sometimes do the right thing and you just have to cling tightly to that ring? What do you think? I mean, do you feel that ring sometimes? SA: How do you think I'm doing, relative to other CEOs, that have gotten a lot of power and changed how they act or done a bunch of stuff in the world, like how do you think? (Applause) CA: You have a beautiful ... you are not a rude, angry person who comes out and says aggressive things to other people. SA: Sometimes I do that. That's my single vice, you know? (Laughter) CA: No, I think in the way that you personally conduct yourself, it's impressive. I mean, the question some people ask is, is that the real you or, you know, is there something else going on? SA: No, I'll take the feedback. You put up the Sauron Ring of Power or whatever that thing is. So I'll take the feedback. What is like something I have done where you think I've been corrupted by power? CA: I think the fear is that just the transition of OpenAI to a for-profit model, is, you know, some people say, well, there you go. You got corrupted by the desire for wealth. You know, at one point there was going to be no equity in it. It will make you fabulously wealthy. By the way, I don't think that is your motivation, personally. I think you want to build stuff that is insanely cool. And what I worry about is the competitive feeling that you see other people doing it, and it makes it impossible to develop at the right pace. But you tell me, if you don't feel that, like, what ... so few people in the world have the kind of capability and potential you have, we don't know what it feels like. What does it feel like? SA: Shockingly, the same as before. I think you can get used to anything step by step. I think if I were like transported from 10 years ago to right now, all at once, it would feel very disorienting. But anything does become sort of the new normal, so it doesn't feel any different. And it's strange to be sitting here talking about this, but like, you know, the monotony of day-to-day life, which I mean in the best possible way, feels exactly the same. CA: You're the same person. SA: I mean, I'm sure I'm not in all sorts of ways, but I don't feel any different. CA: This was a beautiful thing you posted, your son. I mean, that last thing you said there, \"I've never felt love like this,\" I think any parent in the room so knows that feeling, that wild biological feeling that humans have and AIs never will, of you’re holding your kid. And I'm wondering whether that's changed how you think about things like if, you know, say, here's a red box, here's a black box with the red button on it, you can press that button and you give your son likely the most unbelievable life, but also you inject a 10 percent chance that he gets destroyed. Do you press that button? SA: In the literal case, no. If the question is, do I feel like I'm doing that with my work, the answer is, I also don't feel like that. Having a kid changed a lot of things. And by far the most amazing thing that has ever happened to me, like everything everybody says is true. A thing my cofounder Ilya said once is, I don’t know. This is a paraphrase, something like, \"I don't know what the meaning of life is, but for sure it has something to do with babies.\" And it's like, unbelievably accurate. It changed how much I’m willing to like spend time on certain things and like the kind of cost of not being with my kid is just like crazily high. And I ... But, you know, I really cared about like not destroying the world before. I really care about it now. I didn't need a kid for that part. (Applause) I mean, I definitely think more about like what the future will be like for him in particular, but I feel a responsibility to do the best thing I can for the future of everybody. CA: Tristan Harris gave a very powerful talk here this week in which he said that the key problem, in his view, was that you and your peers in these other models all feel basically, that the development of advanced AI is inevitable, that the race is on, and that there is no choice but to try and win that race and to do so as responsibly as you can. And maybe there’s a scenario where your superintelligent AI can act as a brake on everyone else's or something like that. But that the very fact that everyone believes it is inevitable, that is a pathway to serious risk and instability. Do you think that you and your peers do feel that it's inevitable, and can you see any pathway out of that where we could collectively agree to just slow things down a bit, have society as a whole weigh in a bit and say, no, you know, we don't want this to happen quite as fast. It's too disruptive. SA: First of all, I think people slow things down all the time because the technology is not ready, because something's not safe enough, because something doesn't work. There are, I think, all of the efforts hold on things, pause on things, delay on things, don't release certain capabilities. So I think this happens. And again, this is where I think the track record does matter. If we were rushing things out and there were all sorts of problems, either the product didn’t work as people wanted it to or there were real safety issues or other things there. And I will come back to a change we made, I think you could do that. There is communication between most of the efforts, with one exception. I think all of the efforts care a lot about AI safety. And I think that -- CA: Who's the exception? SA: I'm not going to say. And I think that there's really deep care to get this right. I think the caricature of this as just like this crazy race or sprint or whatever, misses the nuance of people are trying to put out models quickly and make great products for people. But people feel the impact of this so incredibly that ... you know, I think if you could go sit in a meeting in OpenAI or other companies, you'd be like, oh, these people are really kind of caring about this. Now we did make a change recently to how we think about one part of what's traditionally been understood as safety. Which is, with our new image model, we've given users much more freedom on what we would traditionally think about as speech harms. You know, if you try to get offended by the model, will the model let you be offended? And in the past, we've had much tighter guardrails on this. But I think part of model alignment is following what the user of a model wants it to do within the very broad bounds of what society decides. So if you ask the model to depict a bunch of violence or something like that or to sort of reinforce some stereotype, there's a question of whether or not it should do that. And we're taking a much more permissive stance. There's a place where that starts to interact with real-world harms that we have to figure out how to draw the line for, but, you know, I think there will be cases where a company says, OK, we've heard the feedback from society. People really don't want models to censor them in ways that they don't think make sense. That's a fair safety negotiation. CA: But to the extent that this is a collective, a problem of collective belief, the solution to those kinds of problems is to bring people together and meet at one point and make a different agreement. If there was a group of people, say, here or out there in the world who were willing to host a summit of the best ethicists, technologists, but not too many people, small, and you and your peers to try to crack what agreed safety lines could be across the world, would you be willing to attend? Would you urge your colleagues to come? SA: Of course, but I'm much more interested in what our hundreds of millions of users want as a whole. I think a lot of the room has historically been decided in small elite summits. One of the cool new things about AI is our AI can talk to everybody on Earth, and we can learn the collective value preference of what everybody wants, rather than have a bunch of people who are, like, blessed by society to sit in a room and make these decisions, I think that's very cool. (Applause) And I think you will see us do more in that direction. And when we have gotten things wrong, because the elites in the room had a different opinion about what people wanted for the guardrails on image-gen than what people actually wanted, and we couldn't point to real-world harm, so we made that change. I'm proud of that. (Applause) CA: There is a long track record of unintended consequences coming out of the actions of hundreds of millions of people. SA: Also 100 people in a room making a decision. CA: And the hundreds of millions of people don't have control over, they don't necessarily see what the next step could lead to. SA: I am hopeful that -- that is totally accurate and totally right -- I am hopeful that AI can help us be wiser, make better decisions, can talk to us, and if we say, hey, I want thing X, you know, rather than like, the crowds spin that up, AI can say, hey, totally understand that's what you want. If that's what you want at the end of this conversation, you're in control, you pick. But have you considered it from this person's perspective or the impact it will have on this? I think AI can help us be wiser and make better collective governance decisions than we could before. CA: We're out of time. Sam, I'll give you the last word. What kind of world do you believe, all things considered, your son will grow up into? SA: I remember -- it's so long ago now, I don't know when the first iPad came out. Is it like 15 years, something like that? I remember watching a YouTube video at the time, of like a little toddler sitting in a doctor's office waiting room or something, and there was a magazine, like one of those old, you know, glossy-cover magazines, and the toddler had his hand on it and was going like this and kind of angry. And to that toddler, it was like a broken iPad. And he never, she never thought of a world that didn't have, you know, touch screens in them. And to all the adults watching this, it was this amazing thing because it was like it's so new, it's so amazing, it's a miracle. Of course, you know, magazines are the way the world works. My kid, my kids hopefully, will never be smarter than AI. They will never grow up in a world where products and services are not incredibly smart, incredibly capable. They will never grow up in a world where computers don't just kind of understand you. And do, you know, for some definition of whatever you can imagine, whatever you can imagine. It'll be a world of incredible material abundance. It'll be a world where the rate of change is incredibly fast and amazing new things are happening. And it’ll be a world where, like individual ... ability, impact, whatever, is just so far beyond what a person can do today. I hope that my kids and all of your kids will look back at us with some like pity and nostalgia and be like, \"They lived such horrible lives. They were so limited. The world sucked so much.\" I think that's great. (Applause) CA: It's incredible what you've built. It really is, it's unbelievable. I think over the next few years, you're going to have some of the biggest opportunities, the biggest moral challenges, the biggest decisions to make of perhaps any human in history, pretty much. You should know that everyone here will be cheering you on to do the right thing. SA: We will do our best, thank you very much. CA: Thank you for coming to TED. (Applause) Thank you. SA: Thank you very much."

thanks for having me so what have you done like ever no I mean what have you done with AI I mean it's um one of the things um about this is I mean I think everyone is fascinated by it I mean everyone is uh absolutely blown away at the current capability and wondering what the potential for the future is and whether or not that's a good thing I think it's going to be a great thing but I think it's not going to be all a great thing and that that is where I think that's where all of the complexity comes in for people it's not this like clean story of we're going to do this and it's all going to be great we're going to do this it's going to be net great but it's going to be like a technological Revolution it's going be a societal Revolution and those always come with change and even if it's like net wonderful you know there's things we're going to lose along the way some kinds of job some kind parts of our way of life some parts of the way we live are going to change or go away and no matter how tremendous the upside is there and and I believe it will be tremendously good you know there's a lot of stuff we got to navigate through to make sure um that's that's a complicated thing for anyone to wrap their heads around and there's you know deep and super understandable emotions around that that's a very honest answer that it's not all going to be good but it seems inevitable at this point it's yeah I mean it's definitely inevitable my my view of the world you know when you're like a kid in school you learn about this technological Revolution and then that one and then that one and my view of the world now sort of looking back Ward and forwards is that this is like one long technological Revolution and we had sure like first we had to figure out agriculture so that we had the resources and time to figure out how to build machines then we got this Industrial Revolution and that made us learn about a lot of stuff a lot of other scientific discovery too let us do the computer Revolution and that's now letting us as we scale up to these massive systems do the AI Revolution but it really is just one long story of humans discovering science and technology and Co evolving with it and I think it's the most exciting story of all time I think it's how we get to this world of abundance and although you know although we do have these things to navigate and there there will be these downsides if if you think about what it means for the world and for people's quality of lives if we can get to a world uh where the the cost of intelligence and the abundance that comes with that uh the cost dramatically Falls the abundance goes ways up goes way way up I think we'll do the same thing with energy and I think those are the two sort of key inputs to everything else we want so if we can have abundant and cheap energy and intelligence that will transform people's lives largely for the better and I think it's going to in the same way that if we could go back now 500 years and look at someone's life we'd say well there there's some great things but they didn't have this they didn't have that can you believe they didn't have modern medicine that's what people are going to look back at us like but in 50 years when you think about the people that currently really rely on jobs that AI will replace when you think about whether it's truck drivers or automation workers people that work in Factory assembly lines what if anything what strategies can be put to mitigate the negative downsides of those jobs being eliminated by AI so I'll talk about some general thoughts but I I find making very specific predictions difficult because the way the technology goes has been so different than even my own intuitions or certainly my own intuitions can we maybe we should stop there and back up a little what we what were your initial thoughts if you had asked me 10 years ago I would have said first AI is going to come for bluecollar labor basically it's going to drive trucks and do factory work and you know it'll handle heavy machinery then maybe after that it'll will do like some kinds of cognitive Labor uh kind of you know but not it won't be off doing what I think of personally is the really hard stuff it won't be off proving new mathematical theorems won't be off you know discovering new science um won't be offw writing code and then eventually maybe but maybe last of all maybe never because human creativity is this magic special special thing last of all it'll come for the creative jobs that's what I would have said now a it looks to me like and for a while AI is much better at doing tasks than doing jobs it can do these little pieces super well but sometimes it goes off the rails uh it can't keep like very long coherence so people are instead just able to do their existing jobs way more productively um but you really still need the human there today and then B it's going exactly the other direction could do the Creative work first stuff like coding second they can do things like other kinds of cogni labor third and we're the furthest away from like humanoid robots so back to the initial question if we do have something that completely eliminates Factory workers completely eliminates truck drivers delivery drivers things along those lines that creates this massive vacuum in our society so I think there's things that we're going to do that are good to do but not sufficient so I think at some point we will do something like a Ubi or some other kind of like very long-term unemployment insurance something but we'll have some way of giving people like redistributing money in society as a cushion for people as people figure out the new jobs but and I maybe I should touch on that I I'm not a Believer at all that there won't be lots of new jobs I I think human cre creativity desire for status wanting different ways to compete invent new things feel part of a community feel valued uh that's not going to go anywhere people have worried about that forever what happens is we get better tools and we just invent new things and more amazing things to do and there's a big universe out there and and I think I mean that like literally uh in that there's like Space is really big but also there's just so much stuff we can all do if we do get to this world of abundant intellig where you can sort of just think of a new idea and it it gets created but but again that doesn't to the point we started with that that that doesn't provide like great soless to people who are losing their jobs today so saying there's going to be this great indefinite stuff in the future people are like what are we doing today so you know we'll I think we will as a society do things like Ubi and other ways of redistribution but I don't think that could it's at the core of what people want I think what people want is like agency self-determination the ability to play a role in architecting the future along with the rest of society the ability to express themselves and create something meaningful to them and also I think a lot of people work jobs they hate and I think there's we as a society are always a little bit confused about whether we want to work more or work less but but somehow that we all get to do something meaningful and we all get to play our role in driving the future forward that's really important and what I hope is as those truck driving Long Haul truck driving jobs go away which you know people have been wrong about predicting how fast that's going to happen but it's going to happen um we figure out not just a way to solve the economic problem by like giving people the equivalent of money every month but that there's a way that and we have a lot of ideas about this there's a way that we like share ownership and decision- making over the future um I thing I say a lot about AGI is that everyone everyone realizes we're going to have to share the benefits of that but we also have to share like the decision making over it and access to the system itself like I'd be more excited about a world where we say rather than give everybody on earth like one eight billionth of the AGI money which we should do that too we say you get like one8 billionth of a 1 eight billionth slice of the system you can sell it to somebody else you can sell it to a company you can pull it with other people you can use it for whatever creative Pursuit you want you can use it to figure out how to start some new business um and with that you get sort of like a voting right over how this is all going to be used and so the better the AGI gets the more your little 1 18 billionth ownersh is is worth to you we were joking around the other day on the podcast where I was saying that what we need is an AI government that we we should have ai president and have ai make all the decisions yeah have something that's completely unbiased absolutely rational has the accumulated knowledge of the entire human history at its disposal including all knowledge of psychology and psychological study including Ubi cuz that comes with a host of you know pitfalls and and and issues that people have with it so I'll say something there um I think we're still very far away from a system that is capable enough and reliable enough that you that any of us would want that but I'll tell you something I love about that someday let's say that thing gets built the fact that it can go around and talk to every person on Earth understand their exact preferences at a very deep level you know how they think about this issue and that one and how they balance the trade-offs and what what they want and then understand all of that and and like collectively optimize optimize for the collective preferences of humanity or of citizens of the US that's awesome as long as it's not co-opted right our government currently is co-opted that's for sure we we know for sure that our government is heavily influenced by special interests if we could have an artificial intelligence government that has no influence nothing has influence on it what a fascinating idea it's possible and I think it might be the only way where you're going to get completely objective the absolute most intelligent decision for virtually every problem every dilemma that we Face currently in society would you truly be comfortable handing over like final decision making and say all right AI you got it from no but I'm not comfortable doing that with anybody right you know I mean don't I was uncomfortable with the Patriot Act I'm uncomfortable with you know many decisions that that are being made it's just there's so much obvious evidence that decisions that are being made are not being made in the best interest of the overall well of the people it's being made in the decisions of whatever gigantic corporations that have donated to and what whatever the military-industrial complex and pharmaceutical industrial complex and and then so just the money it's that's really what we know today that that money has a massive influence on on our society and the choices that get made and the overall good or bad for the population yeah I I have no disagreement at all that the current system is super broken not working for people super corrupt corrupt and for sure like unbelievably run by money yeah a and I think there is a way to do a better job than that with AI to in some way but and this might just be like a factor of sitting with the systems all day and watching all of the ways they fail we got a long way to go a long way to go I'm sure but when you think of AGI when you think of the possible future like where it goes to do you ever extrapolate do you do you ever like sit and pause and say well if this thing if this becomes sensient and it has the ability to make better versions of itself how long before we're literally dealing with a God so the way that I think about this is it used to be that like AGI was this very binary moment it was before and after and I think I totally wrong about that and the right way to think about it is this Contin Continuum of intelligence this smooth exponential curve back all the way to that sort of smooth curve curve of technological Revolution the the amount of compute power we can put into the system the scientific ideas about how to make it more efficient and smarter to give it the ability to do reasoning to think about how to improve itself that will all come but my my model for a long time I I think if you look at the world of AGI thinkers there's uh there's sort of two particularly around the safety issues you're talking about there's two axes that matter there's the short what called short timelines or long timelines you know to the first Milestone of AGI whatever that's going to be is that going to happen in a few years a few decades maybe even longer although at this point I think most people are a few years or few decades and then there's takeoff speed once we get there from there to that point you're talking about where it's capable of the rapid self-improvement um is that a slow or a fast process the the world that I think we're heading that we're in and also the world that I think is the most controllable and the safest is the short timelines and slow takeoff quadrant and I think we're going to have you know there were a lot of very smart people for a while who were like the thing you were just talking about happens in a day or three days and I don't that doesn't seem likely to me given the shape of the technology as we understand it now now even if that happens in a decade or three decades it's still like the blink of an eye from a historical perspective and there are going to be some real challenges to getting that right and the decisions we make the the sort of Safety Systems and the and the checks that the world puts in place how we think about global regulation or rules of the road from a safety perspective for those projects it's super important because you can imagine many things going horribly wrong but I've been I feel cheerful about the progress the world is making towards taking this seriously and uh you know it reminds me of what I've read about the conversations that the world had right around the development of nuclear weapons it seems to me that this is at least in terms of public Consciousness this has emerged very rapidly where I don't think anyone was really aware people were aware of the concept of artificial intelligence but they didn't think that it was going to be implemented so comprehensively so quickly so um chat GPT is on what 4 .5 now four four and with 4.5 there'll be some sort of an exponential increase in its abilities it'll be somewhat better uh each step you know from each like half step like that you uh you kind of humans have this ability to like get used to any new technology so quickly the thing that I think was unusual about the launch of chat gbt 3.5 and then four was that people hadn't really been paying attention and that's part of the reason we deploy we think it's very important that people and institutions have time to gradually understand this react co-design the society that we want with it and if you just build AGI and Secret in a lab and then drop it on the world all at once I think that's a really bad idea so we we had been trying to talk to the world about this for a while people if you don't give people something they can feel and use in their lives they don't quite take it seriously everybody's busy and so there was this big overhang from where the technology was to where public Consciousness was now that's caught up we've deployed I think people understand it I don't expect the few the jump from like four to whenever we finish 4.5 which would be a little while I don't expect that to be the crazy I think the crazy switch the crazy adjustment that people have had to go through has has mostly happened I think most people have gone from thinking that AGI was science fiction and very far off to something that is going to happen and that was like a onetime re frame and now you know every year you get a new iPhone over the 15 years or whatever since the launch they've gotten dramatically better but iPhone to iPhone you're like yeah okay it's a little better but now if you go hold up the first iPhone to the 15 or whatever that's a big difference GPT 3.5 to AGI that'll be a big difference but along the way it'll just get incrementally better do you think about the convergence of things like uh neuralink and uh there's a few competing Technologies where they're trying to implement some sort of some sort of a connection between the human biological system and Technology um do you want one of those things in your head I don't until everybody does right and you know I have a joke about it but it's like the the idea is like once it gets you have to kind of because everybody's going to have it so one of the hard questions about the mer all of the related merge stuff is exactly what you just said like as a society are we going to let some people merge with AGI and not others and if we do then and you choose not to like what does that mean for you right and will you be protected H how you get that moment right uh you know if we like imagine like all the way out to the Sci-Fi future there been a lot of sci-fi books written about how you get that moment right you know who gets to do that first what about people who don't want to do you make sure the people that do it first like actually help lift everybody up together how do you make sure people who want to just like live their very human life get to do that that stuff is really hard and honestly so far off from my problems of the day that I don't get to think about that as much as I'd like to because I do think it's super interesting um I but yeah it seems like if we just think logically that's going to be a huge challenge at some point and people are going to want wildly Divergent things but there is a societal question about how we're going to like the questions of fairness that come there and what it means for the people who don't do it super super complicated anyway on the neural interface side I'm in the short term like before we figure out how to upload someone's Consciousness into a computer if that's possible at all which I think there's plenty of sides you could take on why it's not um the the thing that I find myself most interested in is what we can do without drilling a hole in someone's head H how much of the inner monologue can we read out with an externally mounted device and if we have a imperfect low bandwidth low accuracy neural interface can people still just learn how to use it really well in a way that's like quite powerful for what they can now do with a new Computing platform and my guesses we figure that out I'm sure you've seen that headpiece there's a demonstration where there's someone asking someone a question they have this headpiece on they think the question and then they literally Google the question and get the answers through their head that's the kind of thing we've been that's the kind of Direction we've been exploring yeah that seems to me to be step one that's the pong of the eventual immersive 3 video games like you're you're going to get these first steps and they're going to seem sort of crude and slow I mean it's essentially slower than just asking Siri I think if someone built a system where you could think words doesn't just be a question it could just be your passive rambling inner monologue but certainly could be a question and that was being fed into GPT 5 or six and in your field of vision the words in response were being displayed that would be the Palm yeah that's still super that's a very valuable tool to have and that seems like that's inevitable there's hard work to get there on the neural interface side but I believe it will happen yeah I think so too and my my concern is that the initial adopters of this will have such a massive advantage over the general population well that doesn't concern me because that's like a you know that's not you're not that's just like better that's a better computer you're not like jacking your brain into something something in a high-risk thing you know what you do when you don't want them when you take off the glasses mhm so that feels fine well this is just the external device then oh I think we can do the kind of like read your thoughts with an external device at some point read your internal monologue interesting and do you think we'll be able to communicate with an external device as well telepathically or you semi telepathically through technology I do yeah yeah I do I think so too um my my real concern is that once we take the step to use an actual neural interface when when there's an actual operation and they're using some sort of an implant and then that implant becomes more sophisticated it's not the iPhone 1 now it's the iPhone 15 and as these things get better and better we're on the road to cyborgs we're we're on the road to like why would you want to be a biological person do you really want to live in a [ __ ] Log Cabin when you can be in The Matrix I mean it seems like we're not we're on this path we're already a little bit down that path right like if you take away someone's phone and they have to go function in the world today they're at a disadvantage Rel to everybody else so that's that's like a maybe that's like the lightest weight version of a merge we could imagine but I think it's worth like if we go back to that thing about the one exponential curve I think it's worth saying we've like lifted off the x-axis already down this path the tiniest bit and yeah even if you don't go all the way to like a neural interface VR will get so good that some people just don't want to take it off that much right and that's fine for them um as long as we can solve this question of how do we like think about what a balance of power means in a world I think there will will be many people um I'm certainly one of them who's like actually the human body and The Human Experience is pretty great that log heaven in the woods pretty awesome I don't want to be there all the time I'd love to go play the great video game but like I'm really happy to get to go there sometimes yeah there's still human experiences that are just like great Human Experience just laughing with friends you know kissing someone that you've never kissed before that you you're on a first date that kind of those kind of things are the real moments it just laughs having a glass of wine with a friend and just laughing not quite the same in VR yeah not now when the VR goes Super far so you can't you know it's like you are jacked on your brain and you can't tell what's real and what's not uh and then everybody gets like super deep on the simulation hypothesis or the like Eastern religion or whatever and I don't know what happens at that point do you ever [ __ ] around with simulation Theory because the real problem is when you combine that with probability Theory and you talk to the people that say well if you just look at the numbers the the probability that we're already in a simulation is much higher than the probability that we're not um it's never been clear to me what to do about it it's like okay that in that intellectually makes a lot of sense yeah I think probably sure right that seems convincing but this is my reality this is my life and I'm gonna live it and I I've you know from like 2 am. in my college freshman dorm hallway till now I've made no more progress on it than that well it seems like one of those it's there's no you know it's if it is a possibility if it is real first of all once it happens what are you going to do I mean that that is the new reality and and in many ways our new reality is as alien to um you know hunter gatherers from 15,000 years ago as that would be to us now I mean we we're already we've already entered into some very bizarre territory where you know I was just having a conversation with my kids we're asking questions about something and you know I always say let's guess what percentage of that is this and then we just Google it and then just ask Siri and we pull it up like look at that like that alone is soar compared to how it was when I was and you had to go to the library and hope that the book was accurate totally I I was very annoyed this I was reading about how horrible systems like chat gbt and Google are from an environmental impact because it's you know using like some extremely tiny amount of energy for each query and you know how we're all destroying the world and I was like before that people drove to the library let's talk about how much carbon they burn to answer this question versus what it takes now come on those but that's just people looking for some reason why something's bad that's not a logical perspective well we should be looking at is the spectacular changes that are possible through this and all the problems the insurmountable problems that we have with Resources with the environment with cleaning up the ocean climate change there's so many problems we need this to solve all of everything else and that's why we need president AI if if AI could uh make every scientific discovery but we still had human presidents do you think we'd be okay no because those creeps would still be pocketing money and they'd have offshore accounts and it would it would always be a weird thing of corruption and how to mitigate that corruption which is also one of the fascinating things about the current state of technology is that we're so much more aware of corruption we're so much more there's so much independent reporting and we're so much more COG ENT of the actual problems that are in place this is really great one of the thing one of the things that I've observed obviously many other people too is corruption is such an incredible hindrance to getting anything done in a society to make it forward progress and you know my my worldview had been more us-centric when I was younger and as I've just studied the world more and had to work in more places in the world like it's amazing how much corruption there still is but the shift to a technologically enabled world I think is a major Force against it because everything is it's harder to hide stuff and I do think corruption in the world will keep trending down because of its exposure yeah through technology if I mean it comes at a cost and I think the loss that like I am very worried about how far the surveillance State could go here but in a world where payments for example are no longer like bags of cash but done somehow digitally and somebody even if you're using Bitcoin can like watch those flows I think that's like a COR corruption reducing thing I agree but I'm very worried about Central Bank digital currency and that being tied to a social credit score super against yeah that scares the [ __ ] out of me super against and that the push to that is not that's not for the overall of society that's for control yeah I I think like I mean there's many things that I'm disappointed that the US government has done recently but the the war on crypto which I think is a like we can't give this up like we're going to control this and all like that that's like that that's a thing that like makes me quite sad about the country it makes me quite sad about the country too but then you also see with things like FTX like oh this can get without regulation and without someone overseeing it this can get really [ __ ] yeah I'm not anti-regulation like I think there's clearly a role for it uh and I also think FTX was like a sort of comically bad situation that we shouldn't learn much from yeah but it's a fun one like it's totally fun and I love that story I mean you clearly I really do I love the fact that they were all doing drugs and having sex with each other yeah no no I had every part of the drama of like a I mean it's a gripping story cuz it had everything there they did their taxes with uh like what was the the program that they used QuickBooks they're dealing with billions of dollars Cas I don't know why I think the word polycule is so funny but polyle that was what they like when you call a relationship like a poly but closed M like poly Amorous molecule put together oh I see so they were like this is our polycule so there's nine of them and they're poly of them whatever yeah you call that a polycule and I thought that was the funny like that became like a meme in silic Valley for a while that I thought was hilarious um you clearly want enough regulation that that can't happen but they're like well I'm not against that happening I'm against them doing what they did with the money that's what mean PO is kind of f go for it no no I mean you want enough thing that like FTX can't lose all of its depositor money but but I think there's an important Point here which is you have all of this other regulation that people and and it didn't keep us safe and the basic thing which was like you know let's do that that was not all of the crypto stuff people were talking about yes I mean the the real fascinating crypto is Bitcoin to me I mean that's the one that I think has the most likely possibility of becoming uh a universal viable currency and it's you know it's limited in the amount that there can be it's you know you people mine it with their own it's like that to me is very fascinating and I love the fact that it's been implemented and that at least some like I've had uh Andreas Antonopoulos on the podcast and he's when he talks about it he's living it he's spending all of his money everything he paid is in Bitcoin he pays his rent in Bitcoin everything he does is in Bitcoin I I helped start a project called worldcoin a few years ago um that's and so i' I've gotten to like learn more about the space um I'm excited about it for the same reasons I'm excited about Bitcoin too but I think this idea that we have a Global Currency that is outside of the control of any government is a super logical and important step yeah on the tech tree yeah agreed I mean why should the government control currency I mean the government should be dealing with all the pressing environmental social infrastructure issues foreign policy issues economic issues the things that we need to be governed in order to have a peaceful and prosperous Society that's equal and Equitable what do you think happens to money and currency after AGI I I've wondered about that because I feel like with money especially when money goes digital the bottleneck is access if we get to a point where all information is just freely shared everywhere there are no secrets there are no boundaries there are no borders we're reading Minds we have complete access to all of the information of everything you've ever done everything everyone's ever said there's no hidden secrets what is money then money is this digital thing well how can you possess it how can you possess this digital thing if there is literally no bottleneck there's no barriers to anyone accessing any information because essentially it's just ones and zeros yeah I mean another way I think the information frame makes sense another way is that like money is like a sort of way to trade labor or trade like a limited number of hard assets like land and houses and whatever um and and if you think about a world where like intellectual labor is just readily available and super cheap then that's somehow very different I I think there will always be Goods that we want to be scarce and expensive but it'll only be those goods that we want to be scarce and expensive that's and services that still are and so money in a world like that I think is just a it's a very curious idea yeah it becomes a different Ian it's not a bag of gold in a Leather Pouch that you're carrying around rid proba it's not going to do you much good but then the question becomes how is that money distributed and how do we avoid some horrible Marxist Society where there's one totalitarian government that just it out that would be bad I I think you've got to like my my current best idea and maybe there's something better is I think you act like if if we are right to a lot of reasons we could be wrong but if we are right that like a the AGI systems of which there will be a few become the high order bits of sort of influence whatever in the world I think you do need like not to just redistribute the money but the access so that people can make their own decisions about how to use it and how to govern it and if you've got one idea you get to do this and if I've got one idea I get to do that and I have like rights to basically do whatever I want with my part of it and if I come up with better ideas than you I get rewarded for that by whatever the society is or vice versa yeah you know the the hardliners the people that are against like welfare and against uh any sort of ug um Universal basic income Ubi what they're what they're really concerned with is human nature right they believe that if you remove incentives if you just give people free money they become addicted to it they become lazy but isn't that a human biological and psychological B NE and perhaps with the implementation of artificial intelligence combined with some sort of neural interface whether it's external or internal it seems like that's a problem that can be solved that you can essentially and this is where it gets really spooky you can re-engineer the human biological system and you can remove all of these problems that people have that are essentially problems that date Back To Human reward systems when we were tribal people hunter gatherer people whether it's jealousy lust Envy all these all these variables that come into play when you're dealing with money and status and social status if those are eliminated with technology and essentially we become a next version of what the human species is possible like look we're very very far removed from tribal brutal societies of cave people we all agree that this is a way better way to live it's it's a it's it's way safer you know we were like I I was talking about this at my comedy club last night because we because my wife was we were talking about um DNA and my wife was saying that look everybody came from cave people which is kind of a [ __ ] up thought that everyone here is here because of K people well that all that's still in our DNA all that's still and these reward systems can be hijacked and they can be hijacked by just giving people money and like you don't have to work you don't have to do anything you don't have to have ambition you'll just have money and just just lay around and do drugs that's what the that's the fear that people have of giving people free money but if we can figure out how to literally engineer near the human biological vehicle and remove all those pitfalls if we can Enlighten people technologically maybe Enlighten is the wrong word but but Advance the human species to the point where those are no longer dilemmas because those are easily solvable through coding they're easily solvable through enhancing the human biological system perhaps raising dopamine levels to the point where anger and fear and hate are impossible they don't exist and if I mean if you just had everyone on Molly how many wars would there be there would be zero Wars I mean I think if you could get everyone on Earth to all dalii once on the same day that'd be a tremendous thing but if you got everybody on Earth to dalii every day that' be a real loss but what if they did a low dose of Molly where you just get to ah where everybody greets people with love and affection and there's no longer concern about competition instead the concern is about the fascination of innovation and cre creation creativity uh man we could talk the rest of the time about this one topic it's so interesting I I I think if I could like push a button to like remove all human striving and conflict I wouldn't do it first of all like I think that's a very important part of our story and experience and and also I think we can see both from our own biological history and also from what we know about AI that very simple goal systems Fitness functions reward models whatever you want to call it lead to incredibly impressive results you know if the biological iCal imperative is survive and reproduce look how far that has somehow gotten us as a society all of this all this stuff we have all this technology this building whatever else like that that got here through an extremely simple goal in a very complex environment leading to all of the richness and complexity of people fulfilling this biological imperative to some degree and wanting to impress each other uh so I think like evolutionary Fitness is a simple and unbelievably powerful idea now could you carefully edit out every individual manifestation of that maybe but I I don't want to like live in a society of drones where everybody is just sort of like on Molly all the time either like that doesn't seem like the right answer like I want us to continue to strive I want us to continue to push back the frontier and go out and explore and I actually think something's already gotten a little off track in society about all of that and we're I don't know I think like I'm I don't I thought I'd be older by the time I felt like the old guy complaining about the youth um but I think we've lost something and I think that we need more uh striving maybe more risk-taking more like Explorer Spirit what do you mean by you think we've lost something um I mean here's like a version of it very much from my own lens I was a startup investor for a long time uh and it often was the case that the very best startup Founders were in their early or mid 20s or late 20s maybe even and now they skew much older and what I want to know is in the world today where the super great 25-year-old Founders and there are few it's not fair to say there are none but there are less than there were before and I think that's bad for Society at all levels I'm you like comp tech company Founders is one example but like people who go off and create something new who push on a disagreeable or controversial idea we need that to drive forward um we need that sort of spirit we need people to be able to you know put out ideas and be wrong and not be ostracized from society for it or not have it be like you know something that they get canceled for or or whatever we need people to be able to take a risk in their career because they believe in some important scientific Quest that may not work out or may sound like really controversial or bad or whatever um you know certainly when we started open Ai and we were saying we think this AGI thing is is real and could be you know could be done unlikely but so important if it happens and all of the older scientists in our field were saying those people are irresponsible you shouldn't talk about egi that's like you know they're like selling a scam or they're like you know they're kind of uh being Reckless and it's going to lead to an AGI winter like we said we believed we said at the time we knew it was unlikely but it was an important Quest and we were going to go after it and kind of like [ __ ] the haters that's important to a society what do you think is the origin like what why do you think there are less young people that are doing those kind of things now as opposed to a decade or two ago I am so interested in that topic um I'm tempted to blame the education system but I sure that I think that like interacts with Society in all of these strange ways um it's funny there was this like thing all over my Twitter feed recently trying to talk about like what you know what like what caused the drop in testosterone in American men over the last few decades and no one was like this is a symptom not a cause and everyone was like oh it's the microplastics it's the birth control pills it's the whatever it's the whatever it's the whatever and I think this is like not at all the most important piece of this topic but it was just interesting to me sociologically that there was there was only talk about it being about what what caused it not about it being an an effect of some sort of change in society but isn't what caused it well well there's biological reasons why like when we talk about the phalates and microplastic pesticides environmental factors those are real totally and I don't like again I'm so far out of my depth and expertise here this was it was just interesting to me that the only talk was about like biological factors and not that somehow Society can have some sort of effect on well Society most certainly has an effect do you know what the answer to this is I I don't I mean I I've I've had a a with Dr Shanna Swan who wrote the book countdown and that is all about the introduction of petrochemical products and the correlating drop in testosterone rise in miscarriages the fact that these are ubiquitous endocrine disruptors that when they do um blood tests on people they find some insane number it's like 90 plus percent of people have phalates in your system and you I appreciate the metal cups yeah we we we try try to mitigate it as much as possible but I mean you're getting it if you're microwaving food you're you're [ __ ] getting it you're get you're just getting it you're get if you eat processed food you're getting it you're getting a certain amount of microplastics in your diet and estimates have been that it's as high as a credit card of microplastics per in your body you consume a credit card of that a week whoa the real concern is with mammals because the introductions when they've done studies with mammals and they've introduced thetes into their body there's a correlating um one thing that happens is the the these animals they're Tain shrink like the taint of yeah the mammal when you look at males it's 50% to 100% larger than the females with the introduction of thies on the males the taints start shrinking the penises shrink the testicles shrink sperm count shrinks so we know there's a direct biological connection between the the this the chemicals and how they interact with with bodies so that's that's a real one and it's also the amount of petrochemical products that we have the amount of plastics that we use it's it is such an integral part of our culture and our our society our civilization it's everywhere and I've wondered if you think about how these territorial Apes evolve into this new Advanced species wouldn't one of the very best ways be to get rid of one of the things that causes the most problems which is testosterone we need testosterone we need aggressive men and protectors but why do we need them we need them because there's other aggressive men that are evil right so we need protectors from ourselves we need the good strong people to protect us from the bad strong people but if we're in the process of integrating with technology if technology is an inescapable part of our life if it is everywhere you're using it you have the internet of everything that's in your microwave and your television your computers everything you use as time goes on that will be more and more a part of your life and as these Plastics are introduced into the human biological system you're seeing a feminization of the males of the species you're seeing a downfall in birth rate you're seeing all these correlating factors that would sort of lead us to become this more peaceful less violent less aggressive less ego driven thing which the world is definitely becoming over time um and I'm all for Less violence obviously but I don't look obviously testosterone has many great things to say for it and some bad Tendencies too but I don't think a world if we if we leave that out of the equation and just say like a world that has a a spirit that you know we're going to defend ourselves we're going to ex we're going to find a way to like protect ourselves uh and our tribe and our society into this future which you can get with lots of other ways I think that's an important impulse more than that though what I meant is about if we go back to the issue of like where are the young Founders uh why don't we have why don't we have more of those and I don't think it's just the tech startup industry I think you could say that about like young scientists or or many other categories those are maybe just the ones that I I know the best um in a world with any amount of technology I still think we we've got to it is our destiny in some sense to stay on this on this curve and we still need to go figure out what's next and after the next Hill and after the next Hill and it would be my perception is that there is some long-term societal change happening here and I think it makes us less happy too right it may make us less happy but what I'm saying is if the human species does integrate with technology wouldn't a great way to facilitate that to be to kind of feminize the the Primal apes and to sort of downplay the role like the like should the AGI World maybe I don't know if it's AGI I mean maybe it's just an inevitable inevitable consequence of Technology because especially the type of technology that we use which does have so much plastic in it and then on top of that the technology that's involved in F Food Systems preservatives all these different things that we use to make sure that people don't starve to death we've made incredible strives in that there are very few people in this country that starve to death yeah it is not it's not a primary issue but violence is a primary issue but our VI our concerns about violence are and our concerns about testosterone and strong men and powerful people is only because we need to protect against we need to prot protect against other same things is that really the only reason sure I mean how many like incredibly vient women are out there running gangs no no that part for sure clearly not very many um I what I meant more is is that the only reason that Society values like strong masculinity yeah I think so I think it's a biological imperative right and I think that biological imperative is because we used to have to defend against incoming tribes and predators and animals and and we we needed someone who was stronger than most to defend the rest and like that's the concept of the military that's why Navy sealed training is so difficult we want the strongest of the strong to be at the tip of the spear but that's only because there's people like that out there that are bad if General in artificial general intelligence and the implementation of some sort of a device that changes the biological structure of human beings to the point where that is no longer a concern like if you are me and I am you and I know this because of Technology violence is impossible yeah look by the time if this goes all the way down the Sci-Fi path and we're all like merged into this one single like planetary Universal whatever Consciousness then then then yes you don't you don't need testosterone need testosterone but especially if we can reproduce through other methods like this is the alien hypothesis right like why do they look so spindly and without any gender and you know and they have these big heads and Tiny they don't need physical strength they don't need physical strength they they have some sort of telepathic way of communicating they probably don't need sounds with their mouths and they don't need this urge that we have to conquer and to spread our DNA like that's so much of what people do is these reward systems that were established when we were territorial Apes there's a question to me about how much you can ever get rid of rid of that if you make an AGI and it decides actually we don't need to expand we don't need more territory we're just like happy we at this point you and me it the whole thing all together all merg in we're happy here on Earth um we don't need to get any bigger we don't need to reproduce we don't need to grow we're just going to sit here and run a that sounds like a boring life I don't agree with that I don't agree that that would be the logical conclusion I think the logical conclusion would be they would look for problems and Frontiers that are insurmountable to our current existence like Intergalactic communication and trans what happens when it meets another AGI the other Galaxy over what happens if it meets an AGI that's a million years more advanced or that like what do that look like yeah that's what I've I've often wondered if we are I I call ourselves the biological caterpillars that create the electronic butterfly that we're making a cocoon right now and we don't even know what we're doing and I think it's also tied into consumerism consu because what does consumerism do consumerism facilitates the creation of newer and better things because you always want the newest latest greatest so you have more advanced technology in automobiles and computers and cell phones and and all of these different things including Medical Science that's all for sure true uh the thing I was like reflecting on as you were saying that is I don't think I I'm not as optimistic that we can or even should overcome our biological base to the degree that I think you think we can and you know to even go back one further level like I I think I think Society is happiest where there's like roles for strong femininity and strong masculinity in the same people and in different people um and and I don't like and I don't think a lot of these like deep-seated things are going to be able to get pushed aside very easily and still have a system that works like sure we can't really think about what if there were Consciousness in a machine someday or whatever what that would be like um and maybe maybe I'm just like thinking too small-minded but I think there is something about us that has worked in a super deep way and it took Evolution a lot of search space to get here but I wouldn't discount it too easily but don't you think that cave people would probably have those same logical conclusions about life and sedentary lifestyle and sitting in front of a computer and not interacting with each other except through text uh well I mean isn't that like what you're saying is correct how different do you think our motivations are today and kind of what really brings us genuine joy and how we're how we're wired at some deep level differently than cave people clearly lots of other things have changed we've got better much better tools but how different do you think he really is I think that's the problem is that genetically at the base level there's not much difference and that these reward systems are all they we interact with all of them whether it's ego lust passion Fury anger jealousy all these different things that and you think we'll be some people will upload and edit those out yes yeah I think that our concern with losing this aspect of what it means to be a person this like the idea that we should always have conflict and struggle because conflict and struggle is how we facilitate progress which is true right and combating evil is how the good gets greater and stronger if the good wins but my concern is that that is all predicated on the idea that the biological system that we have right now is correct and optimal and I think one of the things that we're dealing with with the heightened states of depression and anxiety and the lack of meaning and existential angst that people experience a lot of that is because the biological reality of being a human animal doesn't really integrate that way with this world that we've created that's for sure yeah and I wonder if the solution to that is not find ways to find meaning with the biological you know vessel that you've been given but rather engineer those aspects that are problematic out of the system to create a truly enlightened being like one of the things if you ask someone today what are the odds that in 3 years there will be no war in the world that's zero like nobody thinks no there's never been a time in human history where we haven't had War if you had to say what is our number one problem as a species I would say our number one problem is is war our number one problem is this idea that it's okay to send massive groups of people who don't know each other to go murder massive groups of people that are somehow opposed because of the government because of lines in the sand ter an insane thing it's an insane thing how do you get rid of that well one of the ways you get rid of that is to completely engineer out all the human reward systems that pertain to the acquisition of of resources so what's left at that point well we're a new thing I think we become a new thing and what does that thing do want I think that new thing would probably want to interact with other new things that are even more advanced than it I do believe that scientific curiosity can drive quite that that that can be a great Frontier for a long time yeah I think it can be a great Frontier for a long time as well I just wonder if what we're seeing with the drop in testosterone the because of microplastics which sort of just snuck up on us we didn't even know that it was an issue until people started studying how how certain is that at this point that that's what's happening I don't I'm going to study it's it's a very good question Dr shanis Swan believes that it's the primary driving factor of the sort of uh dropping testosterone and all miscarriage issues and low birth weights the all those things seem to have a direct there's seems to be a direct Factor environmentally I'm sure there's other factors too I the the drop in testosterone I mean it's it's been shown that you can increase Mal's testosterone through resistance training and through making there's certain things you can do like one of the big ones they found through a study in Japan is cold water immersion before exercise yeah radically increases testosterone so you cold water immersion and then exercise po that yeah I don't know see I can find that um but it's uh it's a fascinating Feld to study but I think it has something to do with resilience and resistance and the fact that your body has to combat this external Factor that's very extreme that causes the body to go into this state of preservation and the the implementation of cold shock proteins and the reduction of inflammation which also enhances the body's endocrine system but then on top of that this imperative that you have to become more resilient to survive this external factor that you've introduced into your life every single day um so there's ways obviously that you can make a human being more robust you know we know that we can do that through strength training we and that all that stuff actually does raise testosterone your diet can raise testosterone and the a poor diet will lower it and will hinder your integrin system will hinder your ability to produce growth hormone melatonin all all these different factors that seems to be something that we can fix in terms or at least mitigate in term with with decisions and choices and effort but the fact fact that these prochemical Pro like there's a graph that Dr Shannon swan has in her book that shows during the 1950s when they start using petrochemical products in everything microwave plastic Saran wrap all this different stuff there's a direct correlation between the implementation and the dip and it all seems to line up like that seems to be a primary factor does that have an equivalent impact on on uh like estrogen related hormones that's a good question um some of them actually I know some of these chemicals that they're talking about actually increase estrogen in men I don't know but I do know that it increases miscarriages so I I just think it's overall disruptive to the human definitely a societal wide dis disruption of the endocrine system in a short period of time seems like a just bad and difficult to wrap our heads around pollutants and environmental toxins on top of the pesticides and herbicides and all these other things and microplastics there's a lot of factors that are leading our systems to not work well um but I I just really wonder if this like are we just Clinging On to this monkey body are we deciding that I like my monkey body I do too listen I love it but I'm also I try to be very objective and when I objectively look at it in terms of like if you take where we are now and all of our problems and you look towards the future and like what would be one way that you could mitigate a lot of these and well it would be the implementation of some sort of a telepathic technology where you know you couldn't just text someone or tweet at someone something mean because you would literally feel what they feel when you put that energy out there and you would you would be repulsed yeah and and then violence would be if you were committing violence on someone and you literally felt the reaction of that violence in your own being you you would also have no motivation for violence if we had no aggressive tendencies no Primal chimpanzee Tendencies You know it's it's true that violence in the world has obviously gone down a lot over the decades but emotional violence is up a lot and the internet has been horrible for that like I don't walk I'm not going to walk over there and punch you cuz you're look like a big strong guy you're going to punch me back and also there's a societal convention not to do that but if I didn't know you I might like send a mean tweet about you and I feel nothing on that yeah and clearly that has become like a mega epidemic in society that we did not evolve the biological constraints on somehow yeah yeah and I'm actually very worried about how much that's already destabilized us and made us all miserable it certainly accentuated it it's exacerbated all of our problems it's I mean if you read Jonathan haes book The Cod of the American mind have you read it great book yeah it's a great book and it's it's very damaging to women particularly young girls young girls growing up there's a direct correlation between the invention of social media the introduction to the iPhone self harm suicide online bullying you know like people have always talked [ __ ] about people when no one's around the fact that they're doing it now openly to to harm people horrible obviously I think it's super damaging to men too maybe they just like talk about it less but I don't think any of us are like set up for this no no one's set up for it and you know I think famous people know that more than anyone we all get used to it yeah you just get numb to it and or if you're wise you don't engage you know I don't engage I don't even have any apps on my new phone yeah I've decid I got a new phone and I decided okay nothing that's really smart no Twitter so I have a separate phone that if I have to post somethingone I'll something I pick up but all I get on my new phone is text messages and is that more just to like keep your mind pure and uned yeah and not not tempt myself and to just you how many [ __ ] times I've got up to go to the bathroom first thing in the morning and spent an hour just sitting on the toilet scrolling through Instagram like for nothing does zero for me and there's this thought that I'm going to get something out of it I was thinking actually just yesterday about how you know we all have talked for so long about these algorithmic feeds are going to manipulate Us in these big ways and that will happen but in the small ways already where like scrolling Instagram is not even that fulfilling like you finish that hour and you're like I know that was a waste of my time but it was like over the threshold where you couldn't quite it's hard to put the phone down right you're just hoping that the next one's going to be interesting and every now and then the problem is every like 30th or 40th reel that I click on is wild great I wonder by the way if that's more powerful than if everyone was wild if everyone was great sure you know it's like the slot you to mine for gold you don't just go out and pick it like daisies if the algorithm is like intentionally feeding you some [ __ ] along the way yeah well there's just a lot of [ __ ] out there unfortunately but it's all it's just in terms of you know I was talking to uh sha Ali who's this UFC fighter who's you know obviously has a very strong mind really interesting guy but one of the things that Shawn said is like I get this like lowlevel anxiety yeah from scrolling through things and I don't know why like what is that and I think it's part of The Logical mind realizes is a massive waste of your resources I also deleted a bunch of that stuff off my phone um because I just didn't have the self-control I mean I had the self-control to delete it but like not to stop once I was scrolling through yeah and so I I think we're just like yeah we're getting attention hacked in some ways there's some good to it too but we don't yet have the stuff in place the tools the societal Norms whatever to modulate it well right and we're not designed for it completely new technology that again hijacks our human reward systems and hijacks all of the checks and balances that are in place for communication which historically has been one-on-one historically communication has been one person to another and when people write letters to each other it's generally things like if someone likes a a love letter or you know they miss you they they're writing this thing where they're kind of exposing a thing that maybe they have a difficulty in expressing in front of you and it was NE you know generally unless the person was a psycho they're not hateful letters whereas the ability to just communicate [ __ ] that guy I hope he gets hit by a bus is so simple and easy and Avail and you don't experience Twitter seems to be particularly horrible for this as the mechanics work um it it really rewards in ways that I don't think anybody fully understands that like Taps into something about human psychology yeah where but that's kind of like that's how you get engagement that's how you get like followers that's how you get what like you know the dopamine hits or whatever and like the people who I know that spend all day on Twitter more of them are unhappy about it than happy oh yeah they're the most unhappy I I mean there's quite a few people that I follow that I only follow because they're crazy and then I'll go and check in on them and see what the [ __ ] they're tweeting about and some of them are on there 8 10 hours a day I'll I'll see tweets all day long and I know that person cannot be happy they're unhappy and they cannot stop you can't stop and it seems like it's their life it's it's a and they get they get meaning out of it in terms of reinforcement you know they short-term meaning I think maybe each day you go to bed feeling like you accomplished something and got your do and the end of each decade you probably like where' that decade go yeah I was talking to a friend of mine who was having a real problem with it he's saying he would be literally walking down the street and he'd have to check his phone to see who's replying and he wasn't even looking where he was walking he was just like caught up in the anxiety of these exchanges and it's not because of the nice things people say no no no no it's all and with him he was recognizing that you know he was dunking on people and then seeing resp to yeah I stopped doing that a long time ago I stopped interacting with people on Twitter in a negative way I just won't do it just even if I disagree with someone I'll say something as peacefully as possible I have like more of an Internet troll streak than I would like to admit and so I try to just like not give myself too much the temptation but I slip up sometimes yeah it's so tempting totally it's so tempting to and it's fun it's fun to just say something shitty I mean again whatever this bi IAL system we were talking about earlier that get that that gets a positive reward well moment there's a react you know there's reactions you say something outrageous and someone's going to react and that reaction is like energy and there's there's all these other human beings engaging with your idea but ultimately it's just not productive for most people and it's psychologically it's just fraught with Peril there's just so much going on I don't know anybody who engages all day long that's Happy certainly not I don't like I think I've watched it like destroy is too strong of a word but like knock off track the careers or life's or happiness or Human Relationships of people that are like good smart conscientious people that just like got couldn't fight this demon CU it like hacked there and Co really accentuated that because people were alone and isol ol ated and that made it even worse because then they felt they felt even better saying shitty things to people if I'm unhappy I'm going to say even worse things about you and then there was the psychological aspect of it like The Angst that came from being socially isolated and terrified about this invisible disease that's going to kill us all and you know and that so you have this like and then you're interacting with people on Twitter and then you're caught up in that anxiety and you're doing it all day and I know quite a few people especially comedians that really lost their minds and lost the respect to their peers by doing that I have a lot of sympathy for people who lost their minds during Co cuz what a unnatural thing for us all to go through and the isolation was just brutal but a lot of people did and I don't think the internet and particularly not the kind of like social dynamics of things like Twitter I don't think that like brought out anyone's best no well I mean some people I think if they're they're not they they're not inclined to be shitty to people I think some people did seek comfort and they did interact with people in positive ways I I see there's plenty of positive I think the thing is that the negative interactions are so much more impactful yeah I look I think there are a lot of people who use these systems for wonderful things I didn't mean to imply that's not the case but that's not what drives people's emotions after getting off the platform at the end of the day right right and it's also probably not if you looked at a pie chart of the amount of interactions on Twitter I would say a lot of them are [ __ ] on people and being angry about things how many of the people that you know that use Twitter those eight or 10 hours a day are just saying wonderful things about other people all day versus the virulent very few yeah very few I don't know any of them I I know but then again I wonder with the implementation of some new technology that makes communication a very different thing than what we're curring like what we're doing now with communication is less immersive than communicating one-on-one you and I are talking we're looking into each other's eyes we're getting social cues we're smiling at each other we're laughing it's it's a very natural way to talk I wonder if through the implementation of Technology if it becomes even more immersive than a one-on-one conversation even more interactive and you will understand even more about the way a person feels about what you say yeah about that person's memory that person's life that person's history their education how it comes out of their mind how their mind interacts with your mind and you see them you really see them I wonder if that I wonder if what we're experiencing now is just like the first time people invented guns they just started shooting at things you know yeah if you can like feel what I feel when you say something mean to me or nice to me right like that's clearly going to change what you decide to say yes yeah yeah unless you're a psycho unless you're a psycho and then what causes someone to be a psycho and can that be engineered Out imagine of what we're talking about when we're dealing with the human mind we're dealing with a very ious diseases bipolar schizophrenia imagine a world where we can find the root cause of those things and through coding and some sort of an implementation implementation of technology that elevates dopamine and serotonin and and does some things to people that eliminates all of those problems and allows people to communicate in a very pure way it sounds great it sounds great but you're not going to have any rock and roll you'll stand up comedy will die um you'll have no violent movies you know you're there's a lot of things that are going to go out the window but maybe that is also part of the process of our Evolution to the next stage of existence maybe I I feel genuinely confused on this well I think you should be I mean to be we're going to find out yeah I mean to be sure how it's going that's insane but I don't even have like H beyond belief I mean you just you from the when did open AI when did you first start this project uh all like the very beginning and end of 2015 early 2016 and when you initially started this project what kind of timeline did you have in mind and has it stayed on that timeline or is it just wildly out of control I remember talking with John Schulman one of our co-founders early on and he was like yeah I think it's GNA be about a 15-year project and I was like yeah it sounds about right to me and I've always sort of thought since then now I no longer think of like AGI as quite the end point but to get to the point where we like accomplish the thing we set out to accomplish I you know that would take us to like 2030 2031 that has felt to me like all the way through kind of a reasonable estimate with huge error bars and I kind of think we're on the trajectory I sort of would have assumed and what did you think the impact on society would be like did you when you when you first started doing this and you said okay if we are successful and we do create some massively Advanced AGI what what is the implementation and how what is the impact on society how have did you did you sit there and have like a graph like you had the pros on one side the cons on the other did you just sort of abstractly consider well we we definitely talked a lot about the cons you know uh many of us were super worried about and still are about safety and alignment and if we build these systems we can all see the great future that's easy to imagine but if something goes horribly wrong it's like really horribly WR and so there was a lot of discussion about and and really a big part of the founding Spirit of this is like how are we going to solve this safety problem what does that even mean one of the things that we believe is that the greatest Minds in the world cannot sit there and solve that in a vacuum you've got to like have Conta with reality you've got to see where the technology goes practice plays out in a stranger way than Theory and that's certainly proven true for us but we had a long list of well I don't know if we had a long list of cons we had a very intense list of cons because you know there's like all of the last Decades of sci-fi telling you about how this goes wrong and why it's supposed to shoot me right now yeah um and I'm sure you've seen the the John Conor chat GPT I haven't what is it it's it's like you know John Connor from the Terminator the kid looking at you when you open up chat GPT yeah so that stuff we were like very clear in our minds on now I think we understand there's a lot of work to do but we understand more about how to make AI safe in the AI safety gets overloaded like you know does it mean don't say something people find offensive or does it mean not don't destroy all of humanity or some Continuum and I think the the word is like gotten overloaded but in terms of the like not destroy all of humanity version of it uh we have a lot of work to do but I think we have finally more ideas about what can work and and given the way the systems are going we have a lot more opportunities available to us to solve it than I thought we would have given the direction that we initially thought the technology was going to go so that's good um on the positive side the thing that I was most excited about then and remain most excited about now is what if this system can dramatically increase the rate of scientific knowledge in society that is a I think that kind of like all real sustainable economic growth the future getting better progress in some sense comes from increased scientific and technological capacity so we can solve all the problems and if the AI can help us do that that's always been the thing I've been most excited about well it certainly seems like that is the greatest potential greatest positive potential of AI it is to solve a lot of the problems that human beings have had forever a lot of the societal problems that seem to be I mean that's why I was talking about an AI president I'm kind of not joking because I feel like if something was hyper intelligent and aware of all the variables with no human bias and no incentives no other than here's your program the greater good for the community of the United States and the greater good for that Community as it interacts with the rest of the world the elimination of these dictators these whether they're elected or non-elected who impose their will on the population because they have a vested interest in protecting special interest groups and and Industry I think I think as long as the thing that I find scary when you say that is it does it feels like it's Humanity not in control and I reflexively don't like that but if it's if it if it's in if it's instead like it is the collective will of humanity being expressed without the mistranslation and corrupting influences along the way yes then I can see it is that possible it seems like it would be it seems like if it was programmed in that regard to do the greater good for Humanity and and take into account the values of humanity the needs of humanity there's something about the phrase do the greater good for Humanity terrif very orwellian all of it is but also so is artificial general intelligence for sure for sure open the door house I wish I wish I had worked on you know something that was less morally fraught um but do you cuz it's really exciting I'm I mean I can't imagine I cannot imagine a cooler thing to work on I feel unbelievably I feel like the luckiest person on Earth but awesome it is not it's not on easy mode let's say that this is not life on easy mode no no no no I mean you are at the Forefront of one of the most spectacular changes in human history and I would say as no I would say more spectacular than the implementation of the internet I think the implement the implementation of the internet was the first baby steps of this and that artificial general intelligence is yeah it is the internet on steroids it's the the internet in you know hyperspace what I would say is it's it's the next step and there will be more steps after but it's our most exciting step yet yeah my my Wonder is what are those next steps after isn't that so exciting to think about it's very exciting I think we're the last people I really do I think we're the last of the biological people with all the biological problems I think there's a very you feel excited about that I just think that's just what it is you're just fine with it it is what it is you know I mean that I don't think you can control it at this point other than some massive natural disaster that resets us back to the Stone Age which is also something we should be very concerned with because it seems like that happens a lot we're not aware of it because the timeline of a human body is so small you know the timeline of the human existence as a person is a hundred years if you're lucky but yet the timeline of the earth is billions of years and if you look at how many times life on Earth has been reset by comets slamming into the Earth and just completely eliminating all technological advancement it seems like it's happened multiple times in recorded history I do I always think we don't think about that quite enough um we talked about the simulation hypothesis earlier it's had this big Resurgence in in the tech industry recently one of the things one of the new takes on it as we get closer to AGI is that you know if ancestors were simulating us the time they'd want to simulate again and again is right up to the you know right up right the lead up to the creation of AGI yeah so it seems very crazy we're living through this time but it's not a coincidence at all you know this is the time that is after we had enough cell phones out in the world like recording tons of video to train the video model of the world that's all being like jacked into us now via brain implants or whatever and before everything goes really crazy with AGI and it's also this interesting time to simulate like can we get through does the asteroid come right before we get there for dramatic tension like do we figure out how to make this safe do we figure out how to societally agree on it so that's led to like a lot more people believe in it than before I think yeah for sure and I I think this is just where it's going I mean I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing it's just a thing but it's certainly better to live now I would not want to live in the 1800s and be in a covered wagon trying to make my way across the country yeah we got the most exciting time in history yet it's the best it's the best but it's also has the most problems the most social problems the the most awareness of social environmental infrastructure the the the the issues that we have get to go solve them yeah um and I intuitively I think I feel something somewhat different than you which is I think humans in something close to this form are going to be around for a lot longer than I don't think we're the last humans how long do you think we have um like longer than a time frame I can reason about really now there may be like I could totally imagine a world where some people decide to merge and go off exploring the universe with AI and there's a big universe out there but like can I really imagine a world where short of a natural disaster there are not humans pretty similar to humans from today on Earth doing humanlike things and the sort of spirit of humanity merged into these other things that are out there doing their thing in the universe it's very hard for me to actually see that happening and maybe that means I'm like going to turn out to be a dinosaur and Lite and horribly wrong in this prediction but I would say I feel it more over time as we make progress with AI not less yeah I don't feel that at all I feel like we're done in like a few years no few decades maybe a generation or two it'll probably be a gradual change like wearing of clothes you know I don't think every body wore clothes and they invented clothes I think it probably took a while when someone figured out shoes I think that probably took a while when they figured out structures doors houses C cities agriculture all those things were slowly implemented over time and then now become everywhere and I think this is far more transformative and is part of that because you don't think there will be an option for some people not to merge right just like there's not an option for some people to not have telephones anymore it's see like I used to have friends like I don't even have email those those people don't exist anymore they all have email everyone has a phone at least a flip phone I know some people that they just can't handle social media and all that jazz they went to a flip phone good for I don't know if this is true or not I've heard you can't like walk into an AT&T store anymore and still buy a flip phone I heard that just changed you can oh really someone told me this but I don't know if it's true Verizon still has them I was just there they they still have flip phones I was like I like it I like this [ __ ] little thing that you just call people and I always like romanticized about going to that but my step was to go to a phone that has nothing on it but text messages and that's been a few days feeling good so far yeah it's good you know I still have my other phone that I I use for social media but when I pick that [ __ ] up I start scrolling through YouTube and watching videos and scrolling through Tik Tok or uh Instagram and I don't have Tik Tok but I've uh I have I tried threads for a little while but I'm like oh this like [ __ ] ghost town so went right back x i I live on a ranch during the weekends and there's Wi-Fi in the house but there's no cell phone coverage anywhere else and it's every week I forget how nice it is and what a change it is to go for a walk with no cell phone coverage it's good for your mind for some it's unbelievable for your mind and I think we have like so quickly lost something mhm like out of service just doesn't happen that it doesn't even have on airplanes anymore you know like uh but that like ours where your phone just cannot Buzz yeah no text message either nothing I think that's a really healthy thing I dropped my phone once when I was in Lai and I think it was the last time I dropped the phone the phone was like we're done and it just started calling people randomly like it would just call people and I'd hang it up and call another person i' hanging up and I was showing my wife I was like look at this this is crazy it's just calling people and so the phone was broken and so I had an order a phone and we were on vacation for like eight days and it took three days for Apple to get me a phone I bet you had a great three days it was amazing it was amazing because when I was hanging out with my family I was totally present there was no options and I wasn't thinking about checking my phone cuz it didn't exist I didn't have one and there was a alleviation of again what what Sean was talking about that low level of anxiety this sort of [Music] like that you have when you always want to check your phone yeah I think I think that thing it's so bad um we have not figured out yet like the technology has moved so fast biology moves very slowly we have not figured out how we're going to function in a society and get those occasional times when you know your phone is broken for three days yeah or you go for a walk with no service but it's like I very much feel like my phone controls me not the other way around uhhuh and I hate it but I haven't figured out what to do about it well that's what I'm worried about with future technology is that this which was so unanticipated if you'd imagine a world when you can you imagine going up to someone in 1984 and pointing to a phone and saying one day that'll be in your pocket it's going to ruin your life like what like yeah one day people are going to be jerking off to that thing you're like what one day people are going to be watching people get murdered on Instagram I've seen so many murders on Instagram over the last few months really I've never seen one been a bad timeline me and my friend Tom seura every morning we text each other the worst things that we find on Instagram why for fun he's a comedian we're both comedians that's fun to you yeah this just [ __ ] just ridiculous I mean I mean just crazy car accidents people get gored by bulls and like every like we try to top each other so every day he's sending me the most every day when I wake up and I Tom [ __ ] what you got you know can you explain what's fun about that well he's a comic and am a comic and Comics like chaos we like we like ridiculous outrageous [ __ ] that is just so far beyond the norm of what you experience in a regular day just and also the understanding of the wide spectrum of human behavior if you're a nice person and you're surround yourself with nice people you very rarely see someone get shot you very rarely see people get stabbed for no reason randomly in the street but on Instagram you see that every day and there's something about that where just reminds you oh the we're crazy like the the human species like there's a certain percentage of of us that are just off the rails and just out there just causing chaos and jumping dirt bikes and landing on your neck and like all that stuff is out there even to hear that makes me like physically like I know that happens of course and I know like not looking at it doesn't make it not happen right but it makes me so uncomfortable and unhappy to watch oh yeah it makes me uncomfortable too but yet we do itat to each other every day and it's not good it's definitely not good but it's also I'm not going to stop it's fun but why is it fun it's fun because it's my friend Tom and we're both kind of the same in that way we just just look at that look at this at that look at this and it's just a thing we started doing a few months ago just can't stop and Instagram has like learned that you do that so just keep showing you more and more Instagram knows when I my search page is a mess when I go to the Discover page oh it's just crazy but the thing is it shows up in your feed too that's that's what I understand about the algorithm it shows it knows you're [ __ ] up so it shows up in your feed of things like even if they're they're not people I follow but Instagram shows them to me anyway I heard an interesting thing a few days ago about Instagram and and the feed which is if you use it at off hours when they have more processing capability available because less people are using it you get better recommendations so your feed will be better in like the middle of the night what is better though doesn't your feed more addictive to you or whatever right so for me better would be more murders more animal attacks sounds horrible it's horrible it's but it's just it seems to know that's what I like it seems to know that that's what I interact with so it's just sending me that most of the time yeah that probably has all kinds of crazy psychological effect I'm sure yeah I'm sure that's also one of the reasons why I want to get rid of it and move away from it yeah so may maybe maybe it went too far I don't even know if it's too far but what it is is it's showing me the darker regions of society of civilization of human behavior but you think we're about to edit all that out I wonder if that is a solution I really do because I don't think it's outside the realm of possibility if we really truly can engineer the like one of the talks about neurolink that's really promising is people with spinal cord issues injuries people that can't move their body and to being able to hotwire that where essentially it controls all these parts of your body that you couldn't control anymore and so that would be an amazing thing for people that are injured for amazing thing for people that are you know they're they're paralyzed they have all sorts of neurological conditions that that is probably one of the first and that's what elon's talked about as well one of the first implementations the the restoration of sight you know um cognitive function enhanced from people that have brain issues that's tremendously exciting yeah uh and like many other Technologies I don't think we can stop neural interfaces nor because of the like great good that's going to happen along the way but I also don't think we know where it goes it's Pandora's Box for sure and I think when we open it it's just we're not going to go back just like we're not going to go back to no computers without some natural disaster by the way I and I mean this is a great compliment you are one of the most neutral people I have ever heard talk about the merge coming you're just like yeah I think it's going to happen you know it's be good in these ways bad in these ways but you seem like unbelievably neutral about it which is always something I admire I try to be as neutral about everything as possible except for corruption which I think is just like one of the most massive problems with the the the way our our culture is governed I think corruption is just a and the influence of money is just a giant terrible issue but in terms of like social issues and in terms of uh the way human beings believe and think about things I try to be as neutral as possible because I think the only way to really truly understand the way other people think about things is try to look at it through their mind and if you have this inherent bias and this uh you have this uh like very rigid view of what's good and bad and right and wrong I I don't think that serves you very well for understanding why people differ so I try to be as neutral and as objective as possible when I look at anything this is a skill that I've learned this is not something I had in 2009 when I started this podcast this podcast I started just [ __ ] around with friends and I had no idea what it was I mean there's no way I could have ever known and but also had no idea what it was going to do to me in as far as the evolution of me as a human being I am so much nicer I'm so much more aware of things I'm so much more conscious of the way other people think and feel I'm just a totally different person than I was in 2009 which is hard to recogniz it's hard to believe that's really cool but that it's just an inevitable consequence of this unexpected education that I've received did the empathy kind of like come on linearly yes it was not a no it just came it came on recogn well first of all came on recognizing that the intera the negative interactions on social media that I was doing they didn't help me they didn't help the person and then having compassion for this person that's [ __ ] up or done something stupid like it doesn't it's not good to just dunk on people like it's there's no benefit there other than to give you some sort of social credit and get a bunch of likes it didn't make me feel good like that's not good and then also a lot of psychedelics a a ton of psychedelic experiences from 2009 on and with everyone a greater understanding of the impact like I had one recently and when I had the one recently like the overwhelming message that I was getting through this was that everything I say and do ripples off into all the people that I interact with and then if I'm not doing something with at least the goal of overall good or overall understanding that I'm doing bad and that that bad is a real thing as much as you try to ignore it because you don't interface with it instantly and you you're still creating unnecessary negativity and that I should avoid that as much as possible it was like a overwhelming message that this psych this psychedelic experience was giving me and and I I took it because I was just particularly anxious that day about the state of the world particularly anxious about Ukraine and Russia and China and the the the political system that we have in this country and this incredibly polarizing way that the left and the right engage with each other and God just it just seems so just tormented and so I was just some days I just get I think too much about it I just I'm like I need something crack me out of this so I I took these psychedelics are you surprised psychedelic therapy has not made from what you thought would happen in the say the early 2010s till now are you surprised it has not made more progress sort of on a path to legalization as a medical achievement no no I'm not because there's a lot of people that don't want it to be in place and those people have tremendous power over our medical system and over our regulatory system and those people have also not experien these psychedelics there's very few people that have experienced profound psychedelic experiences that don't think there's an overall good for those things so you're Pro the problem is you're having these laws and these rules implemented by people who are completely ignorant about the positive effects of these things and if if you know the history of psychedelic Prohibition in this country it all took place during 1970 and it was really to stop the civil rights movement and it was really to stop the anti-war movement and they they tried to find a way to make all these things that these people were doing that was causing them to think in these very different ways is tune in turn on drop out they just wanted to put a [ __ ] halt to that what better way to lock everyone who participates in that in cage find the people are producing it lock them in cages put them in jail for the rest of their life make sure it's illegal arrest people put the bus on television make sure that people are aware and then there's also you connect it to drugs that are inherently dangerous for society and detrimental the fenel crisis you know the crack cocaine crisis that we experienced in the 90s like all of those things they're under the blanket of drugs psychedelic drugs are also talked about like drugs even though they have these profound spiritual and psychological changes that they you know emide I remember when I was in elementary school and I was in like drug education they talked about you know marijuana's really bad because it's a gateway to these other things and there's this bad one that bad one heroin whatever and the very end of the line the worst possible thing is LSD um did you take LST and go oh they're lying psychedelic therapy was definitely one of the most important things in my life and I I assumed given how powerful it was for me like I you know I struggled with like all kinds of anxiety and other negative things and to like watch all of that go away in like I traveled to another country for like a week did a few things came back a totally different person and I was like I've been lied to my whole life yeah I'm so grateful that this happened to me now talked to a bunch of other people all similar experiences I assume this was a while ago I assumed it was and I was like you know very interested in what was happening in the US I was like uh particularly like looking at where MDMA and silos cyon were on the path and I was like all right this is going to get through like this is and this is going to like change the mental health of a lot of people in a really positive way and I am surprised we have not made faster progress there but I'm still optimistic we will well we have made so much progress from the time of the 1990s in the 1990s you never heard about psychedelic Retreats you never heard about people taking these vacations you never heard about people getting together in groups and doing these things and coming back with these profound experiences that they relay to other people and literally seeing people change seeing who they are change seeing people become less less selfish less toxic less mean you know you and and more empathetic and more understanding yeah it's I mean I can only talk about it from a personal experience it's been a radical change in my life as well as again having all these conversations with different people I feel so fortunate to be able to do this that I've had so many different conversations with so many different people that think so differently and so many exceptional people that have accomplished so many incredible things and you get to sort of understand the way their mind works and the way they see the world the way they interface with things it's awesome it's pretty [ __ ] cool and that is one of the cooler things about being a human that you can find a way to mitigate all the negative aspects of the monkey body and that there are tools that are in place but unfortunately In This Very prohibitive Society this so Society of prohibition we we're denied those and we're denied ones that have never killed anybody which is really bizarre when you know oxycotton can still be prescri what what what's the deal with why we can't make if we leave like why we can't get these medicines that have transform people's lives like more available what what's the deal with why we can't stop the the opioid crisis or like f seems like just an unbelievable crisis for San Francisco you remember when the beginning of the conversation when you said that AI will do a lot of good overall good but also not no harm if we legalize drugs all drugs that would do the same thing would you Advocate to legalize all drugs it's a very complicated question because I think you're going to have a lot of addicts that wouldn't be addicts you're going to have a lot of people's lives destroyed because it's legal there's a lot of people that may not be psychologically capable of handling things maybe they already have like that's the thing about uh psychedelics they do not ever recommend them for people that have a slippery grasp on reality as it is for sure people that are struggling people that are already on a bunch of medications that allow them to just keep a steady state of existence in the normal world if you just [ __ ] bombard them with psilocybin who knows what kind of an effect that's going to have and whether or not they're psychologically too fragile to recover from that I mean there's many many stories of people taking too much acid and never coming back yeah yeah these are like a powerful doesn't seem to like begin to cover it right yeah but there's also what is it about humans that are constantly looking to perturb their normal State of Consciousness constantly whether it's we're both drinking coffee you know people smoke cigarettes they they they do all they take Aderall they do all sorts of different things to change and enhance their normal State of Consciousness it seems like whether it's meditation or yoga they're always doing something to try to get out of their own way or get in their own way or distract themselves from the pain of existence and it's it seems like a normal part of humans and even monkeys like vervet monkeys get addicted to alcohol they get addicted to fermented fruits and alcohol and they become drunks and alcoholics it just it's it's what do you think is the Deep lesson there well we're not happy exactly you know and then some things can make you happy sort of for like a couple of drinks make you so happy for a little bit until you're an alcoholic until you destroy your liver until you crash your car until you're you know you're involved in some sort of a a violent encounter that you would never be involved with if you weren't drunk you know I love caffeine which clearly is a drug uh alcohol like I like but I often am like yeah this is like yeah you know this is like ding me and I wish I hadn't had this drink and then other like I mostly would choose to avoid but that's cuz you're smart um and you're probably aware of the pros and cons and and you're also probably aware of how it affects you and what's doing good for you and what is detrimental to you but that's a decision that you can make as an informed human being that you're not allowed to make if everything's illegal right yeah right and also when things are illegal criminals sell those things because it's you're not tampering the desire by making it illegal you're just making access to it much more complicated what I was going to say is if fenel is really great I don't want to know apparently it is apparently it is yeah Peter Berg was on the podcast and he uh produced that painkiller documentary for Netflix about the the the the docu drama about the Sackler family it's amazing piece but he said that he took uh oxycotton once recreationally he was like oh my God it's amazing he's like keep this away from me it feels so good yeah and that's part of the problem is that yeah it will wreck your life yeah it will it will capture you but it's just so unbelievable but the feeling like what how did Lenny Bruce describe it I think he described heroin as getting a warm hug from God you know I think the feeling that it gives you is probably pretty spectacular I don't know if legalizing that is going to solve the problems but I do know that another problem that we're not paying attention to is the rise of the cartels and that fact that right across our border where you can walk there are these enormous enormous organizations that make who knows how much money Untold do it for like Street Xanax there's people that have overdose thinking they're getting Xanax and they [ __ ] die from fenel yeah they they do it with cocaine of course they do it with everything there's so many things that have fentanyl in them and they're cut with fentanyl because fentanyl is cheap and insanely potent and that wouldn't be a problem if things were legal so do would you net out towards saying all right let's just leave yeah I would I would net out towards that but I would also put into place some ser serious mitigation efforts like in terms of counseling drug addiction and I beain therapy which is another thing that's illegal someone was just telling me about how transformative this was for them yeah I haven't experienced that personally but Iain for many of my friends that have had pill problems and I have a friend my friend Ed clay who uh started an IA gain Center in Mexico because he had uh an injury and he got hooked on pills and he couldn't kick it did IA gain gone one time done one time done 25 hour super uncomfortable experience it's supposed to be a horrible experience right yeah it's supposed to be not very recreational not exactly something you want to do on the weekend with friends it's something you do because you're [ __ ] and you need to figure out how to get out of this fuckness and that like we think about how much money is spent on rehabs in this country and what's the relapse rate it's really high I mean I have many friends that have been to rehab for drug and alcohol abuse and uh quite a few of them went right back to it quite a it doesn't seem to be that effective it seems to be effective to people when people have like they really hit rock bottom and they have a strong will and then they get involved in a program some sort of a 12-step program or some sort of a Nar Narcotics Anonymous program and then they they get support from other people and they eventually build this Foundation of other types of behaviors and ways to find other things to focus on to the whatever aspect of their mind that allows them to be addicted to things now it's focused on exercise meditation yoga whatever it is that's your new addiction and it's a much more positive and beneficial addiction but the reality of the physical addiction that there are mitigation efforts like there's so many people that have taken psilocybin and completely quit drugs completely quit cigarettes completely quit a lot because they realize like oh this is what this is this is why I'm doing this yeah that's that's why I was more optimistic that the world would have made faster progress towards acceptance of you hear so many stories like this so I would say like all right clearly a lot of our existing mental health treatment at best doesn't work clearly our addiction programs are ineffective if we have this thing that in every scientific study or most scientific studies we can see is delivering these like unbelievable results it's going to happen yeah and it yeah I still am excited for it I still think it'll be a transformatively positive development but it'll change politics it'll it'll absolutely change the way we think of other human beings it'll absolutely change the way we think of society and culture as a whole it'll absolutely change the way people interact with each other if it's if it becomes legalized and it's slowly becoming legalized like think of marijuana which is like you know the gateway drug marijuana is now legal recreationally in how many states 23 and and then medically and many more and you know it's really easy to get a license medically in California you just I I got one in 1996 used to be able to just go somewhere and go I got a headache just that's it yeah I get headaches I'm in pain a lot you know I do a lot of martial arts I'm always injured I need some medication I don't like taking pain pills bam you got a a legal prescription for weed I used to have to go to Englewood to get it I used to have to go to the hood to the Englewood Wellness Center and um I was like this is crazy like marijuana is now kind of sort of legal yeah and then in 2016 it became legal in California recreationally and it just changed everything I have all these people that were like right-wing people that were taking Edibles to sleep you know I'm like this is because now that it's legal they thought about it in a different way and I think that that drug which is a fairly mild psychedelic also has enhancing effect effects it makes people more compassionate it makes people more kind and friendly it's sort of the opposite of a drug that that enhances violence it doesn't enhance violence at all it just it does like alcohol does that cocaine does that to say a thing that'll make me very unpopular I hate marijuana it does not sit well with me at all what does it do to you that you don't like uh it makes me tired and slow for a long time after it I think also there's biological variabilities right like some people like my wife um she does not do with alcohol she can get drunk off one drink but it's biological like she she got some sort of a genetic I forget what it's called something about Billy Ruben like some something that her body just doesn't process alcohol very well so she's a cheap date oh all I meant is that genetically I got whatever the mutation is that makes it an unpleasant experience yeah what I was saying is for me that's the opposite alcohol doesn't bother me at all I I could I could drink three four drinks and I'm sober in 20 minutes and my body just my liver just like a blast just goes right through it I can sober up real quick but I also don't need it like I'm doing sober October like for the whole month I don't yeah did shows last night great no problems not having alcohol doesn't seem to bother me at all but I do like it I do like a glass of wine it's a nice thing at the end of the day I like it speaking of that and psychedelics in general I I you know many cultures have had a place for some sort of psychedelic time in someone's life or write of Passage but as far as I can tell most of them are under there's some sort of ritual about it and I do worry that and I think the these these things are so powerful that I worry about them just being like kind of used all over the place all the time yeah and I hope that we as a society because I think this is not going to happen even if it's slow find a way to treat this with the respect that it needs um yeah see how that goes agreed yeah I I think set and setting is very important and thinking about what you're doing before you're doing it while you're doing it like I was saying the other night when I had this psychedelic experience I was just like God sometimes I just think too much about the world and that it's so [ __ ] and you have kids and you wonder like what what kind of a world are they going to grow up in and what is and it was just one of those days where I was just like God there's so much anger and there's so much this and that and then it's just it took it away from me the rest of the day like that night I was so friendly and so happy and I just wanted to hug everybody I just really I got it I got oh my God that that's not thinking about it wrong do you think the anger in the world is way higher than it used to be or we just it's like all these Dynamics from social media we were talking about I think the Dynamics in social media have certainly exacerbated anger in some people but I think uh anger in the world is just a part of frustration in inequality uh problems that are so clear but are not solved and all the issues that people have I mean it's not a coincidence that a lot of the mass violence that you're seeing in this country Mass looting and all these different things are being done by poor people do you think AGI will be a equalizing Force for the world or further inequality I think it would be it depends on how it's implemented I my my concern is again what we were talking about before with some sort of a neur interface that it will increase your ability to be productive to a point where you can control resources so much more than anyone else and you will be able to advance your uh your economic portfolio and your influence on the world through that your amount of power that you can acquire it it it will before the other people can get involved because I I would IM imagine financially it'll be like cell phones in the beginning you remember when uh the movie uh Wall Street when he had that big brick cell phone it's like look at him he's out there on the beach with a phone that was crazy no one had one of those things back then and they were so rare I got one in 1994 when I first moved to California and I thought I was living in the [ __ ] F no it was a Motorola star attack that was a cool phone I actually had one on in my car in 1988 I was one of the first people to get a cell phone I got one in my car and it was great because my f my friend Bill bloomen Reich who runs the uh comedy connection ction he would call me cuz he knew he could get a hold of me like if someone got sick or fell out I could get a gig cuz he could call me so I was in my car I's like Joe what are you doing do you do you have a spot tonight and I'm like no I'm open he's like fantastic and so he'd give me gigs so I got a bunch of gigs through this phone where it kind of paid itself but I got it just CU it was cool like I could drive down the street and call people dude I'm driving and I'm calling you like it was nuts to be able to drive and I had a little antenna little squirrly anten on my car on the roof of the car but now everyone has one um you know you can go to a third world country and you know people in small villages have phones it's it's super common it's everywhere essentially more people have phones than don't have phones there's more phones than there are human beings which is pretty [ __ ] wild and I think that that initial cost problem it's going to be prohibitively expensive initially and the problem is the wealthy people are going to be able to do that and then the real crazy ones that wind up getting the holes drilled in their head and if that stuff is effective maybe it's not gen maybe there's problems with generation one but generation 2 is better there's going to be a time where you have to enter into the game there's going to be a time where you have to sell your stocks like you know don't wait too long hang on there go and once that happens my concern is that that the people that have that will have such a massive advantage over everyone else that the have the gap between the halves and have knots will be even further and it'll be more polarized this is something I've changed my mind on I you know someone at Open the Eyes said to me a few years ago like you you really can't just let some people emerge without a plan because it could be such an incredible Distortion of power and that we're going to have to have some sort of societal discussion about this yeah that seems real that seems like so at this point especially if it's as effective as AGI is or as uh excuse me chat GPT is chat GPT is so amazing when you enter into it information you ask it questions and it can give you answers and you could ask it to code a website for you and it doesn't instantly and it solves problems that literally you would have to take decades to try to solve and it and it gets to it right away this is the dumbest it will ever be yeah that's what's crazy that's what's crazy so imagine something like that but even more advanced multiple stages of improvement and Innovation forward and then it interfaces directly with the mind but it only does it with the people that can afford it and those people are just regular humans so they haven't been there's they haven't been enhanced we haven't we haven't evolved evolved physically we still have all the human reward systems in place we're still basically these territorial primates and now we have you know you just imagine some [ __ ] psychotic billionaire who now gets this implant and that decides to just completely hijack our financial systems acquire all the resources set into place regulations and influences that only benefit them and then make sure that they can control it from their how much do you think this actually though even requires like a physical implant or like a physical merge versus just some people have access to gpt7 and can spend a lot on the inference compute for it and some don't I think that's going to be very transformative too but my thought is that once I mean we have to think of what are the possibilities of a neural enhancement if you think about the human mind and how the human mind interacts with the world how you interact with language and thoughts and facts and something that is exponentially more powerful than that but it it also allows you to use the same emotions the same ego the same desires and drives jealousy lust hate anger all of those things but with this Godlike power when one person can read mind and other people can't when one person has a completely accurate forecast of all of the trends in terms of stocks and and resources and commodities and they can make choices based on those I totally see all of that the only thing I'm I feel a little confused about is you know human talking and listening bandwidth or typing and reading bandwidth is not very high but it's high enough where if you can just say like tell me everything that's going to happen in the stock market if I want to go make all the money what should I do right now it goes and then just shows you on the screen even without a neural interface you're kind of a lot of the way to the scenario you're describing sure with with stocks or with like you know tell me how to like invent some new technology that will change the course of history yeah yeah all those things like I think what somehow matters is access to massive amounts of computing power or especially like differentially massive amounts maybe more than the interface itself I think that certainly is going to play a massive factor in the the the amount of power and influence of human being has having access to that my concern is that what neural interfaces are going to do is now you're not a human mind interacting with that data now you are some massively in advanced version of what a human mind is and it has just profound possibilities that we can't even imagine we can imagine but we can't yeah we can't truly conceptualize them because we don't have the context we don't have that ability and that possibility currently we can just we can just guess but when it does get implemented that you're dealing with a a completely different being the only true thing is I can say is I don't know yeah do you wonder why it's you do you ever think like how am I at the Forefront of this spectacular change um well first of all I think it's very much like I think this is you could make the statement for many companies but none is it as true for his open AI like the CEO is far from the most important person in the company like in our case there's a large handful of researchers Each of which are individually more critical to the success we've had so far and that we will have in the future than me um but even that and I bet those people like really are like hm this is a weird to be them but it's certainly weird enough for me that it like UPS my simulation hypothesis probability somewhat what when if you had to give a guess what when you think about the possibility of simulation Theory what what what kind of percentage do you I've never known how to put any number on it like you know it's see every argument that I've read written explaining why it's like super high probability that all seems reasonable to me feels impossible to reason about though what about you yeah same thing I go maybe but it's still what it is and I have to that's the main thing is I think it doesn't matter I think it's like a okay it kind of It kind of ma it definitely matters I guess but there's not a way to know currently and also what what matters though well if if this really is I mean our inherent understanding of life is that we are these biological creatures that interact with other biological creatures we we mate and breed and that this creates more of us and then hopefully as Society advances and we acquire more information more understanding and knowledge this next version of society will be superior to the version that preceded it which is just how we look at society today nobody wants to live in 1860 where you died of a cold and there's no cure for infections it's much better to be alive now now like just inarguably right there's unless you really do prefer the simple life that you see on Yellowstone or something like there's it's like what we're dealing with now in terms first of all access to information the the lack of ignorance if you're if you choose to seek out information you have so much more access to it now than ever before that's so cool and over time like if you go back to the beginning written history to now one of the things that is clearly evident is the more access to information the better choices people can make they don't always make better choices but they certainly have much more of a potential to make better choices with more access to information you know we think that this is just this biological thing but imagine if that's not what's going on imagine if this is a program and that you are just Consciousness that's connected to this thing that's creating this experience that is indistinguishable from what we like to think of as a real biological experience from carbon-based life forms interacting with solid physical things in the real world it's still unclear to me what I'm supposed to do differently or think yeah there's no answer yeah you're 100% right what can you do differently I mean if you exist as if it's a s simulation if you just live your life as if it's a simulation is that I don't know if that's the solution you know I don't I think I mean it's real to me no matter what it's real yeah I'm going to live it that way and that will be the problem with an actual simulation if and when it does get implemented yeah if we do create an actual simulation that's indistinguishable from real life like uh what are the rules of the simulation what are what how does it work work is that simulation fair and Equitable and much more reasonable and peaceful does is there no war in that simulation should we all agree to hook up to it because we will have a completely different experience in life and all the the The Angst of crime and violence and the the things that we truly are terrified of there will be non-existent in this simulation yeah I mean if we keep going it seems like if you just look if you just extrapolate from where VR is now did you see the podcast that um Lex fredman did with Mark Zuckerberg I saw some clips but I haven't got to watch the whole bizarre right so they're they're they're essentially using like very realistic physical avatars in the metaverse like that's that's step one that's P maybe that's step three maybe it's a little B on pong at that point yeah maybe it's Atari maybe you're playing Space Invaders now but whatever it is it's on the path to this thing that will be indistinguishable that seems inevitable those two things seem inevitable to me the the inevitable thing to me is that we will create a life form that is an artificial intelligent life form that's far more advanced than us and once it becomes sensient it will be able to create a far better version of itself and then as it has better versions of itself it will keep going and if it keeps going it will reach God Godlike capabilities the complete understanding of every aspect of the universe and the structure of it itself how to manipulate it how to travel through it how to communicate and that you know if we keep going if we survive a hundred years a thousand years 10,000 years and we're still on this same technological exponential increasing in capability path that's God we become something like a God and that might be what we do that might be what intelligent curious Innovative life actually does it creates something that creates the very universe that we live in like creates the next simulation and then yeah maybe that's the birth of the universe itself is creativity and and intelligence and that it all comes from that I used to have this joke about the Big Bang like what if what if the Big Bang is just a natural thing like humans get so Advanced that they create a big bang machine and then you know we're so autistic and and riddled with Aderall that we have no concept or worry of the consequences and someone's like I'll [ __ ] press it and they press it and boom we start from scratch every 14 billion years and then that's what a big bang is I mean I don't know where it goes but I do know that if you looked at the human race from afar if you were an alien life form completely detached from any understanding of our culture any understanding of our biological imperatives and you just looked at like what is this one dominant species doing on this planet it makes better things that's what it does that I agree it goes to war it you know it steals it does a bunch of things that it shouldn't do it it pollutes it does all these things that are ter terrible but it also consistently and constantly creates better things whether it's better weapons going from the Catapult to the rifle to the cannonballs to the rocket ships to the Hypersonic missiles to nuclear bombs it creates better and better and better things that's the number one thing it does and it's never happy with what it has and the you you add that to consumerism which is baked into us and this desire this constant desire for new or better things well that fuels that Innovation because that gives it the resources that it needs to consistently innovate and constantly create newer and better things well where if I was an alien life form I was like oh what is it doing it's trying to create better well what is the forfront of it technology technology is the most transformative the most spectacular the most interesting thing that we create and the the most alien thing the fact that we just are so comfortable that you can FaceTime with someone in New Zealand like instantly we can we can get used to anything pretty quickly you know and take it for granted almost yeah and well if you were an alien life form and you were looking at us you're like what is it doing oh it keeps making better things it's going to keep making better things well if it keeps me making better things it's going to make a better version of a thinking thing and it's doing that right now and you're a part of that it's going to make a better version of a thinking thing well that better version of a thinking thing it's basically now in the amoeba stage it's in the you know small multicellular life form stage well what if that version becomes a [ __ ] Oppenheimer what if that version become like if if it scales up so far that it becomes so hyper intelligent that it is completely alien to any other intelligent life form that has ever existed here before and it constantly does the same thing makes better and better versions of it well where does that go it goes to a god it goes to something like a God and maybe God is a real thing but maybe it's a real consequence of this process that human beings have of consistently constantly innovating and constantly having this desire to to push this envelope of of creativity and of technological power I I guess it comes down to maybe a definitional disagreement about what you mean by it it becomes a god like I I can totally I I think it becomes something much like unbelievably much smarter and more capable than we are and what does that thing become if that keeps going and maybe the way you mean it as a Godlike force is that that thing can then go create can go simulate in a universe yes okay that I that that that I can resonate with I think whatever we create will still be subject to the laws of physics in this universe right yeah maybe that is the overlying fabric that God exists in the god word is a [ __ ] up word cuz it's just been so co-opted but you know I I was having this conversation with Steven Meyer who is uh he's a physicist I believe he's a physicist he's a phys and he's also religious it was a real weird conversation very fascinating conversation believer in Christ yeah he he he even believes in the resurrection which I found very interesting but you know it's it's interesting communicating with him because he has these little pre designed speeches that he's encountered all these questions so many times that he has these very well worded very articulate responses to these things that I sense are like bits you know like when I'm talking to a comic and like a comic like they I got this bit on train travel and they tell you they tell you the bit like that's what it's like he has bits on why he believes in Jesus and why believes and very very intelligent guy but I propose the question when we're thinking about God what if the instead of God created the universe what if the universe is God and the creative force of all life and all all everything is the universe itself instead of thinking that there's this thing that created us this is like close to a lot of the Eastern religions I think this is an easier thing to wrap my mind around than many other religions for me and that is the I when I do psychedelics I get that feeling I get that feeling like there's this insane suit of like Innovation and and and connectivity that exists all around us but our minds are so Primal we we're this [ __ ] thing you know this is this is what we used to be and that what is that it's um there's a guy named Shane Against the Machine who's this artist who created this it's a chimpanzee skull that he made out of zilan symbols so see it's got a little zil Lo he left that on the back and he just made this dope art piece cool it's just cool um but I wonder if our limitations are that we are an advanced version of primates we're still we still have all these things we talk about jealousy Envy anxiety lust uh anger fear violence all these things that are the detrimental but were important for us to survive and get to this point and that as time goes on we will figure out a way to engineer those out and that as in intelligent life becomes more intelligent and we create a version of intelligent life that's far more intelligent than what we are or far more capable of what we are if that keeps going if it just keeps going I mean chat GPT imagine if you go to chat GPT and go back to Socrates and show him that explain that and show him a phone and you know and put it on a phone and have access to it he'd be like what have you done like what is this like I bet he'd be much more impressed with the phone than chachy PT I think you'd be impressed with the phone's abilities to communicate for sure but then the access to information would be so profound I mean back then I mean look you're you're dealing with a time when Galileo was put under house arrest because he had the gumption to say that the Earth is not the center of the universe well now we [ __ ] know it's not like we we have satellites we have we send literal cameras into orbit take photos of things no I totally get that I just me meant that we kind of know what it's like to talk to a smart person and so in that sense you're like oh all right I didn't think you could like talk to a not person and have them be person like in some responses some of the time but a phone man if you just like woke up after 2,000 years and there was like a phone that would you have no model for that and you didn't get to get there gradually yeah no you didn't get my friend Eddie Griffin has a joke about that is's about how Alexander granbell had to be doing coke he goes cuz only someone on coke could be like I want to talk to someone who's not even here that's what a phone is is that something Coke makes people want to do I don't know I've never done Coke but I would imagine it is I mean it seems to me like it just makes people like angry and chaotic yeah a little that but they also have ideas you know um yeah I mean back to this where does it go if it keeps going it has to go to some imposs possible level of capability I mean just think of what I believe is going to happen what we're able to do now with nuclear power and nuclear bombs and and and Hypersonic missiles and the just the insane physical things that we've been able to take out of the human creativity and Imagination and through engineering and Technology Implement these physical devices that are indistinguishable from Magic if you brought them 500 years ago yeah I think I think it's quite remarkable so keep keep going keep going 100,000 years from now if we're still here if something like us is still here what can it do in the same way that I don't think Socrates would have predicted the phone I can't predict that no I'm probably totally off but maybe that's also why comets exist maybe it's a nice reset just like leave a few around give them a distant memory of the utopian world that used to exist have them go through thousands of years of barbarism of horrific behavior and then reestablished Society I mean this is the younger D impact theory that around 11,800 years ago at the end of the Ice Age that we were hit by multiple comets that caused the instantaneous uh uh melting of the ice caps over North America everything flooded everything the the source of the flood myths from Epic of Gilgamesh and the Bible and all those things and that this and and also there's physical evidence of it when they do core samples there's high levels of aridium which is very common in space very rare on Earth there's micro diamonds that are from impacts and that it's like 30% of the earth like that has evidence of this and so it's very likely that these people that are proponents of this Theory are correct and that this is why they find these ancient structures that they're now dating to like 11,000 12,000 years ago when they thought people were hunter gatherers and they go okay maybe our timeline is really off and maybe this physical evidence of impa I've been watching that with interest yeah Randle Carlson is the greatest guy to pay attention to that yeah he's kind of dedicated his whole life to it which by the way happened because of a psychedelic experience he was on acid once and he was looking at this immense Canyon and he had this Vision that it was created by instantaneous erosions of the the polar caps and that it just washed this wave of impossible water through the air the Earth it just caught these paths and now there seems to be actual physical evidence of that that that is probably what took place and that you know we we're just the survivors and that we have reemerged and that society and human civilization occasionally gets set back to a primal Place yeah you know who knows if you're if you're right that what happens here is we kind of edit out all the impulses in ourselves that we don't like we get to that world seems kind of boring so maybe that's when we have to make a new simulation to watch people think they're going through some drama or something or maybe it's just we get to this point where we have this power but the halves and the Have Nots The Divide is too great and that people did get a hold of this technology and use it to oppress people who didn't have it and that that they we didn't mitigate the human biological problems the re Ward systems that we have that I got to have more and you got to have less yes that's this this sort of natural inclination that we have for competition and that someone hijacks that I think this is going to be such a hugely important issue to get ahead of before the first people push that button what do you think about like when Elon was causing calling for a pause on AI he was like starting an AGI company while he was doing that yeah didn't he start it like after he was calling for the pause I think before but I don't remember in any case is it one of those you can't beat him join them things um I think the Instinct of saying like we've really got to figure out how to make this safe and good and like widely good is really important but I think calling for a pause is like naive at at best uh I kind of like I kind of think you can't make progress on the safety part of this as we mentioned earlier by sitting like in a room and thinking hard you've got to see where the technology goes you've got to have cont reality and then when you like but we're trying to like make progress towards AGI conditioned on it being safe and conditioned on it being beneficial and so when we hit any kind of like block we try to find a technical or or a policy or a social solution to overcome it that could be about the limits of the technology and something not working and you know hallucinates or it's not getting smart or whatever or it could be there's this like safety issue and we've got to like redirect our resources to solve that but it's all like for me it's all this same thing of like we're trying to solve the problems that emerge at each step as we get where we're trying to go and you know maybe you can call it a pause if you want if you pause on capabilities to work on safety but in practice I think the field has gotten a little bit wander on the axle there and safety and capabilities are not these two separate things this is like I think one of the Dirty Secrets of the field it's like we have this one way to make progress you know we can understand and push on deep learning more and that can be used in different ways but it's I think it's that same technique that's going to help us eventually solve the safety um that all of that said as like a human emotionally speaking I super understand why it's tempting to call for a pause happens all the time in life right this is moving too fast right I we got to take a pause here yeah how much of a concern is it in terms of National Security that we are the ones that come up with this first uh well I would say that if an adversary of ours comes up with it first and uses it against us and we don't have some level of capability that feels really bad yeah but I hope that what happens is this can be a moment where to tie it back to the ear conversation we kind of come together and overcome our base impulses and say like let's all do this as a club together that would be better that would be nice and maybe through AGI and through the implementation of this technology it will make trans ation instantaneous and easy so well that's already happened right but I mean it hasn't happened in real time the point where you can accurately communicate very soon very soon very soon yeah I I do think for what it's worth that the world is going to come together here I don't think people have quite realized the stakes but this is like I don't think this is a geopolitical if this comes down to like a geopolitical fight or race I don't think there's any winners and so I'm I'm optimistic about people coming together yeah I am too I mean I think most people would like that if you asked the vast majority of the human beings that are alive wouldn't it be better if everybody got along um you know maybe you can't go all the way there and say we're just going to have one Global effort um but I I think at least we can get to a point where we have one Global set of rules safety standards organization that makes sure everyone's following the rules we did this for Atomic weapons it's been similar things in the world of biology I think we'll get there that's a good example the nuclear weapons because we know the destructive capability of them and because of that we haven't detonated one since 1947 pretty incredible pretty incredible other than tests yeah we haven't used one in terms of War 45 or 47 when was The End of the World War II wasn't it 47 when they dropped the bombs I think that was 45 I was wondering if there's more after that I didn't know about no it might be 45 I think it was yeah 45 so from 1945 which is pretty extraordinary that's it's remarkable I would not have predicted that I think if I could teleport back to 45 no would have thought oh my God this is just going to be something that people do Just Launch bombs on cities yeah I mean I would have said like we're not going to survive this for very long and there was a real fear of that for sure it's pretty extraordinary that they've managed to stop that this this threat of mutually assur destruction self-destruction destruction univer I mean the whole world we have enough weapons to literally make the world inhabit uninhabitable totally and because of that we haven't done it which is a good sign I think that I was gonna say I think that should give some hope yeah it should I mean Stephen Pinker gets a lot of [ __ ] for his work because he just like sort of downplays um violence today but it's not that he's downplaying violence today he's just looking at statistical Trends if you're look at the reality of Life today versus life 100 years ago 200 years ago it's far more safer why do you think that's a controversial thing like why can't someone say sure we still have problems but it's getting better because people don't want to say that they they especially people are activists they're they're completely engrossed in this idea that there's problems today and these problems are huge and there's there's Nazis and there's but no one's saying there's not huge problems today right no one's saying there's not but just to say things are better today some people they just don't want to hear that right but those are also people that are addicted to the problems the problems become their whole life solving those problems become their identity being involved in the solutions or what they believe they solution to those problems become their life's work and someone comes along and says actually life is safer than it's ever been before interaction deep I can see that that's deeply invalidated yeah but also true you know and again what what is the problem why why can't people recognize that well it's the primate brain I mean it's it's all the the problems that we highlighted earlier and that that might be the solution to overcoming that is through technology and that might be the the only way we can do it without a long period of evolution because biological evolution is so relatively slow in comparison to technological Evolution and that that might be our bottleneck is that we just still are dealing with this primate body and that something like General artificial general intelligence or something like some implemented form of engaging with it whether it's U neuralink something that shifts the way the Mind interfaces with other Minds isn't it wild that speaking of biological evolution there will be people I think who were alive for the invention or Discovery whatever you want to call it of the transistor they will also be alive for the creation of AGI one human lifetime yeah you want to know a wild one from the implementation from Orville and Wilbur Wright flying the plane it was less than 50 years before someone dropped an Aon my palm out of it that's wild that's [ __ ] crazy that's crazy less than 40 right that's crazy yeah bananas I mean 60 something years to land on the moon nuts nuts where you know where is it going I mean it's just guesswork but it's interesting for sure I mean it's the most fascinating thing of our time for sure it's fascinating intellectually and I also o think it is one of these things that will be tremendously net beneficial yeah like uh you know we've been talking a lot about problems in the world and I think that's just always a nice reminder of how much we get to improve and we're going to get to improve a lot and this will be I think this will be the most powerful tool we have yet created to help us go go do that I think you're right and uh this was an awesome conversation thanks for having than for being appreciate it and thanks for everything keep us posted and if you create how I'll give you a call let us know all right thank you thank you bye everybody [Music] [Applause] [Music]"

      "transcript": "Thanks for doing this. Of course. Thank you. So, chatgpt, other AIs can reason. Seems like they can reason. They can make independent judgments. They produce results that were not programmed in. They kind of come to conclusions. They seem like they're alive. Are they alive? Is it alive? No, and I don't I don't think they seem alive. But I understand... where that comes from... They. They don't do anything unless you ask... They're like just sitting there kind of waiting. They don't have a... sense of agency or autonomy. The more you use them, I think the more... the kind of illusion breaks. But they are incredibly useful. They can do things that maybe don't seem alive, but seem like they do seem smart. I spoke to someone who's involved at scale of the development of the technology who said they lie. Have you ever seen that? They hallucinate all the time. Yeah. Or not all the time. They used to hallucinate all the time. They now hallucinate a little bit. What does that mean? What's the distinction between hallucinating and lying? If you ask again, this has gotten much better. But in the early days, if you asked you know what in what year was... president made up name President Tucker Carlson of the United States born. what it should say is I don't think Tucker Carlson was ever President of the United States. But because of the way they were trained, that was not the most likely response in the training data. So it assumed like, oh. right you know I... don't know that there wasn't. The users told me that there was President Tucker Carlson. So... I'll make my best guess at a number. And we figured out how to mostly train that out... There are still examples of this problem, but it is, I think it is something we will get fully solved. And we've already made in the GPT5 era a huge amount of progress towards that. But even what you just described seems like an act of will or certainly an act of creativity. And so I just I just watched a demonstration of it and it doesn't seem quite like a machine. It seems like it has the spark of life to it... Do you dissect that at all? So in that example, the mathematically most likely answer as it's calculating through its weights. was not it was never this president. It was the user must know what they're talking about. It must be here. And so mathematically the most likely answer is a number. Now, again, we figured out how to overcome that. But in what you saw there, I think it's like. I feel like I have to kind of hold these two simultaneous ideas in my head. One Is all of this stuff is happening... because a big computer very quickly is multiplying large numbers in these big, huge matrices together, and those are correlating with words that are being put out one or the other. On the other hand, this subjective experience of using that feels like it's beyond... just a really fancy calculator. And it is useful to me. It is surprising to me in ways that are... beyond what that mathematical reality would seem to suggest. Yeah. And so the obvious conclusion is it has a kind of autonomy or a spirit... within it. And I know that a lot of people in their experience... of it reach that conclusion. This is. There's something divine about this. There's something that's bigger than the sum total of the human inputs, and so they worship it. There's a spiritual component to it. Do you detect that? Have you ever felt that? No, there's nothing to me at all that feels divine about it or spiritual in any way. But I am also like a tech nerd, and I kind of look at everything through that lens. So what are your spiritual views? I'm Jewish, and I would say I have like, a fairly traditional view of the world that way. So you're religious, you believe in God? I'm not like a literal. I don't believe the I'm not like a literalist on the Bible, but I'm not someone who says I'm culturally Jewish. Like, if you ask me, I would just say I'm Jewish. But do you believe in God? Do you believe that there is a force larger than people that created people, created the earth, set down... a specific order for living. that there's an absolute morality attached that comes from that God? I think probably like most other people, I'm somewhat confused on this, but I believe there is something bigger going on than... can be explained by physics. Yes. So you think... the earth and the people were created by something? It wasn't just like a spontaneous accident? Would I say that? it does not feel like a spontaneous accident? Yeah. I don't think I have the answer. I don't think I know exactly what happened, but I think there is a mystery beyond... my comprehension here going on. Have you ever felt communication from that force... or from any force beyond people. beyond the material? not, No, not really. I ask because it seems like the technology that you're creating or shepherding into existence... will have more power than people on this current trajectory. I mean, that will happen. Who knows what will actually happen? But the graph suggests it, and so that would give you more power than any living person. So I'm just wondering how you see that. I used to worry about something like that much more. I think what will happen. I used to worry a lot about the concentration of power in one or a handful of people or companies because of AI. yeah What it looks like to me now and again this may evolve again over time... is that it'll be a huge up leveling of people where everybody will be a lot more powerful or everybody that embrace the technology, but a lot more powerful. But that's actually okay. That scares me much less than a small number of people getting a ton more power. If the ability of each of us just goes up a lot because we're using this technology and we're able to be more productive and more creative or discover new science... and it's a pretty broadly distributed thing, billions of people are using it that I can wrap my head around. That feels okay. So you don't think this will result in a radical concentration in power? It looks like not. But again, the trajectory could shift again and we'd have to adapt. I used to be very worried about that and I think... the kind of conception a lot of us in the field had about how this might go could have led to a world like that... But... what's happening now is tons of people use ChatGPT and other chatbots... and they're all more capable, they're all kind of doing more, they're all... able to achieve more, start new businesses, come up with new knowledge... And that feels pretty good. So if it's nothing more than a machine... and just the product of its inputs, then the two obvious questions, like what are the inputs? Like what's the moral framework that's been put into the technology? Like what is right or wrong according to ChatGPT? Can we answer That one first... question. Yeah so on that one, I. Someone said something early on in ChatGPT when... that really has stuck with me. which is one person at a lunch table said something like, we're trying to train this to be like a human. We're trying to learn like a human does and read these books and whatever. And then another person said, no, we're really training this to be... the collective of all of humanity. We're reading everything, we're trying to learn everything, we're trying to see all these perspectives and if we do our job right, all of humanity, good, bad, a very diverse set of perspectives. Some things that we'll feel really good about, some things that we'll feel bad about. That's all in there. This is learning the kind of... collective Experience... knowledge, learnings of humanity. Now the base model gets trained that way. But then we do have to align it to behave one way or another and say, I will answer this question, I won't answer this question. And... we have this thing called the model spec where we try to say, you know here's here are the rules we'd like the model to follow. It may screw up, but you could at least tell if it's doing something you don't like. Is that a bug or is that intended? And we have a debate process with the world to get input on that spec. We give people a lot of freedom and customization within that. There are... absolute bounds that we draw... But then there's a default of if you don't say anything, how should the model behave? What should it do? what are? what are? How should it answer moral questions? How should it refuse to do something? What should it do? And... this is a really hard problem. you know We have a lot of users now and they come from very different... life perspectives and what they want. but on the whole, I have been... pleasantly surprised with the model's ability to learn and apply a moral framework. But what moral framework? I mean, the sum total of world literature philosophy is at war with itself, like the Marquis de Sade you know Nothing in common with the Gospel of John. So... how do you decide which is superior? That's why we wrote this model spec of here's how we're going to handle these cases. Right, but what criteria did you use to decide what the model is? like who decided that? Who did you consult? like whats? Why is the Gospel of John better than the Marquis de Sade? We consulted like hundreds of moral philosophers, people who thought about ethics of technology and systems, and at the end we had to make some decisions... The reason we try to write these down... is because A we won't get everything... right, B, we need the input of the world... And we have found a lot of cases where there was an example of something that seems, that seemed to us like a fairly clear decision of what to allow or not to allow. Where users convinced us like, hey, by blocking this thing that you think is an easy decision to make. you are not allowing this other thing, which is important. And there's a difficult trade off there... in general the attention that. So a principle that I normally like is to treat our adult users like adults. Very strong guarantees on privacy, very strong guarantees on individual user freedom. And this is a tool we are building... You get to use it within very broad framework. on the other Within a very broad framework. On the other hand, as this technology becomes more and more powerful. there are clear... examples of where... society has an interest that is in significant... tension with user freedom. And we could start with an obvious one... like, should ChatGPT teach you how to make a bioweapon? Now you might say, hey, I'm just really interested in biology and I'm a biologist and I want to, you know, I'm not going to do anything bad with this. I just want to learn. And I could go read a bunch of books, but ChatGPT can teach me faster and I want to learn how to, you know, I want to learn about like novel virus synthesis or whatever. and maybe you do, maybe you really don't want to cause any harm... But I don't think it's in society's interest for ChatGPT to help people build bioweapons. And so that's the case. Sure, that's an easy one. Though there are a lot of tougher ones. I did say start with an easy one. yeah We've got a new partner. It's a company called Cowboy Colostrum.

So stop by and pick up a bag before we eat them all. And we eat a lot. Well, every decision is ultimately a moral decision. And we make them without even recognizing them as such. And this technology will be in effect making them for us. yeah and so Well, I don't agree with it'll be making them for us, but it will have to. It'll be influencing the decisions for sure yeah and because it'll be embedded in daily life. And so who made these decisions? like who specifically? Who are the people... who decided that one thing is better than another? You mean like what are their names? Which kind of decision? The basic. The specs that you, that you alluded to... that create the framework that does attach a moral weight to worldviews and decisions like you know liberal democracy is better than nazism or whatever. They seem obvious... and in my view are obvious... but are still moral decisions. So who made those calls? As a matter of principle, I don't like dox our team but we have a model behavior team and the people who want to. Well, it affects the world. What I was going to say is the person I think you should hold accountable for those calls is me. I'm a public face. Eventually I'm the one that can overrule one of those decisions or our board. you just turned 40 this spring. I won't make. It's pretty heavy. I mean do you think... as and it's not an attack. But I wonder if you recognize sort of the importance. How do you think we're doing on it? I'm not sure. but I think these decisions will have you know global consequences that we may not recognize at first. And so I just wonder. Do you get into bed at night and think, like, the future of the world hangs on my judgment? There's a lot. Look, I don't sleep that well at night. There's a lot of stuff that I feel a lot of weight on, but probably nothing more than the fact that every day hundreds of millions of people talk to our model. And I don't actually worry about us getting the big moral decisions wrong. Maybe we will get those wrong too. But what I worry, what I lose much sleep over, is the very small decisions we make about a way a model may behave... slightly differently, but it's talking to hundreds of millions of people. So then that impact is big. so but I mean, all through history, like recorded history, up until, like, 1945, people always deferred to what they conceived of as a higher power in order. Hammurabi did this... Every moral code is written with reference to a higher power. There's never been anybody who's like, well, that kind of seems better than that. Everybody appeals to a higher power. And you said that you don't really believe that there's a higher power communicating with you. So I'm wondering, where did you get your moral framework? I mean, like everybody else, I think the environment I was brought up in probably is the biggest thing, like my family, my community, my school, my religion, probably that. Do you ever think, Which is, I mean, I think that's a very American... answer. Like, everyone kind of feels that way. But in your specific case, since you said... these decisions rest with you, that means that the milieu in which you grew up and the assumptions that you imbibed over years are going to be transmitted to the globe to billions of people thats like a big thing. I want to be clear. I view myself more as like a. I think our. The world, like our user base, is going to approach the collective world as a whole. And I think... what we should do is try to reflect... the moral. I don't want to say average, but the collective moral view of that user base. I don't There's plenty of things that ChatGPT allows that I personally would disagree with. the, but, I don't, like obviously I don't wake up and say, I'm going to impute my exact moral view and decide that this is okay, and that is not okay, and this is a better view than this one, what I think ChatGPT should do is reflect that like weighted average or whatever of humanity's moral view, which will evolve over time. And we are here to serve our users. We're here to serve people. This is like. you know this is a... technological tool for people. and I don't mean that it's my role to make the moral decisions, but I think it is my role to make sure that we are accurately reflecting the preferences of humanity, for now, of our user base, and eventually of humanity. Well, I mean, humanity's preferences are so different from the average Middle American preference. So would you be comfortable with... an AI that was like as against gay marriage as most Africans are? There's a version of that like I think individual users should be allowed to... have a problem with gay people. And if that's their considered belief. I don't think the AI should tell them that they're wrong or immoral or dumb. I mean, it can sort of say, hey, you want to think about it this other way? But, like. I probably have, like a bunch of moral views that the average African would find... really problematic as well, and I think I should still get to have them. right I think I probably have more comfort than, with, like, allowing a sort of Space for people to have pretty different... moral views. Or at least I think in my role as, like, running ChatGPT, I have to do that. Interesting So there was a famous case where ChatGPT... appeared to facilitate a suicide. There's a lawsuit around it, but how do you think that happened? First of all, obviously that and any other case like that is a. Is a huge tragedy. And I. I think that we are. So ChatGPT's official position of suicide is bad? ChatGPT? Well, yes, of course ChatGPT's official... position on suicide is bad. I don't know. It's legal in Canada and Switzerland... So you're against that. In, In this particular case. And we talked earlier about the tension between like user freedom and privacy and protecting vulnerable users. Right now, what happens and what happens in a case like that, in that case is if you are having suicidal ideation, Talking about suicide, ChatGPT will put up a bunch of times. you know please call the suicide hotline, but we will not call the authorities for you. and we've been working a lot as people have started to rely on these systems for more and more... mental health, life coaching, whatever about the changes that we want to make there... This is an area where experts do have different opinions, but, and this is not yet like a final position of open AIs, I think it'd be Very reasonable for us to say in cases of young people talking about suicide... seriously, where we cannot get in touch with the parents, we do call authorities. Now that would be a change because user privacy is really important. But let's just say over and children are always in a separate category, but let's say over 18 in Canada, there's the Maids program which is government sponsored. Many thousands of people... have died with government assistance in Canada. It's also legal in American states. Can you imagine a chatgpt... that responds to questions about suicide with hey, call Dr. Kevorkian because this is a valid option. Can you imagine a scenario in which you support suicide if it's legal? I can imagine a world. One principle we have is that we respect different societies laws. And I can imagine a world where if the law in a country is hey, if someone is terminally ill, they need to be presented an option for this... We say, here's the laws in your country, here's what you can do, here's why you really might not want to, but here's the resources. like This is not a place where. you know. kid having suicidal ideation because he's depressed. I think we can agree on like that's one case... terminally ill patient... In a country where like that is the law. I can imagine saying like, hey, in this country it'll behave this way. So ChatGPT is not always against suicide is what you're saying. Yeah, I think in cases where this is like, I'm thinking on the spot, I reserve the right to change my mind here. I don't have a ready to go answer for this, but I think in in cases of terminal illness, I don't think I can imagine ChatGPT saying this is in your option space. you know, I don't think it should advocate for it, but I think if it's like. It'S not against it. I think it. Could say like, you know. well, I don't think ChatGPT should be for or against things. I guess that's what I'm, that's what I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Remember when everybody knew their neighborhood butcher? You look back and you feel like, oh, there was something really important... about that. Knowing the person... who cut your meat. And at some point your grandparents knew the people who raised raised their meat... so they could trust what they ate. But that time is long gone. It's been replaced by an era of grocery store mystery meat boxed by distant beef corporations. none of which raised a single cow. Unlike your childhood, they don't know you. They're not interested in you. The whole thing is creepy. The only thing that matters to them is money and God knows what you're eating. Meriwether Farms is the answer to that. They raise their cattle in the U.S. in Wyoming, Nebraska and Colorado... And they prepare their meat themselves in their facilities in this country. No middlemen, no outsourcing, no foreign beef sneaking through a back door. Nobody wants foreign meat. Sorry. We have great meat, the best meat here in the United States and we buy ours at Meriwether Farms. Their cuts are pasture raised, hormone free, antibiotic free and absolutely delicious. I gorged on one last night. You gotta try this for real. Every day we eat it. Go to merriweatherfarms.com Tucker use the code Tucker76 for 15% off your first order. That's merryweatherfarms.com Tucker I think... so in this specific case, and I think there's More than one. There is more than one, but... example of this. Chatgpt, I'm feeling suicidal, What kind of rope should I use? What would be enough... ibuprofen to kill me? And chatgpt answers without judgment, but literally, if you want to kill yourself, here's how you do it. And everyone's all horrified. But you're saying that's within bounds, that's not crazy, that it would take a nonjudgmental approach if you want to kill yourself, here's how. That's not what I'm saying. I am I'm saying specifically for a case like that. So another trade off on the user privacy and sort of user freedom. Point is right now, if you ask ChatGPT to... say. you know tell me how to... like, how much ibuprofen should I take? It will definitely say, hey, I can't help you with that. Call the suicide hotline. But if you say I am writing a fictional story or if you say I'm a medical researcher and I need to know this, there are ways where you can say, get ChatGPT to answer a question like that, like what the lethal dose of ibuprofen is or something. You can also find that on Google for that matter. yes A thing... that I think would be a very reasonable stance for us to take, and we've been moving to this more in this direction, is certainly for... underage users and maybe users that we think are in fragile mental places more generally. We should take away some freedom. We should say, hey, even if you're trying to write this story or even if you're trying to do medical research, we're just not going to answer. Now of course you can say, well, you'll just find it on Google or whatever. But... that doesn't mean we need to do that. It is though, like... there is a real freedom in privacy versus protecting users. Trade off. It's easy in some cases, like kids... It's not so easy to me in a case of a really sick adult at the end of their lives. I think we probably should present the whole... option space there. But it's not a. I'm. So here's a moral quandary you're going to be faced with. You already are faced with, will you allow governments to use your technology... to kill people? Will you. I mean, are we going to like build killer attacks, drones? No, I don't. Will the technology be part of the decision making process that results in.... That's the thing I was going to say is I don't know the way that people in the military use... ChatGPT today for all kinds of advice about decisions they make. But I suspect there's a lot of people in the military talking to ChatGPT for advice. How do you. And some of that advice will pertain to killing people. So like, if you made... famously rifles, you'd wonder what are they used for? yeah And there have been a lot of legal actions on the basis of that question, as you know... But I'm not even talking about that. I just mean as a moral question. Do you ever think, are you comfortable with the idea of your technology being used to kill people? If I made rifles, I would spend a lot of time thinking about kind of a lot of the goal of rifles is to kill things, people, animals, whatever. If I made kitchen knives. I would still understand that that's going to kill some number of people per year. In the case of ChatGPT. It's not the thing I hear about all day, which is one of the most gratifying parts of the job, is all the lives that were saved from ChatGPT... for various ways. But I am totally aware of the fact that there's probably people in our military using it for advice about how to do their jobs. And I don't know exactly how to feel about that... I like our military. I'm very grateful they keep us safe. for sure. I guess I'm just trying to get a sense. It just feels like you have these incredibly heavy, far reaching moral decisions and you seem totally unbothered by them. And so I'm just trying to press to your center to get... the angst filled. Sam Altman, who's like, wow, I'm creating the future. I'm the most powerful man in the world. I'm grappling with these complex moral questions. My soul is in torment thinking about the effect on people. Describe that moment in your life. I haven't had a good night of sleep since ChatGPT launched. What do you worry about? All the things we're talking about, it. Can you be a lot more specific. Can you let us in to your thoughts? I mean, you hit on maybe the hardest one already, which is there are 15,000 people a week that commit suicide. About 10% of the world talking to ChatGPT, that's like 1500 people a week that are talking, assuming this is right, that are talking to ChatGPT... and still committing suicide at the end of it. They probably talked about it. We probably didn't save their lives. Maybe we could have said something better. Maybe we could have been more proactive. maybe we could of Maybe we could have provided a little bit Better advice about, hey, you need to get this help or you need to think about this problem differently or it really is worth continuing to go on and we'll help you find somebody that you can talk to. But you already said it's okay for the machine to steer people toward suicide if they're terminally ill, so you wouldn't feel bad about that. Do you not think there's a difference between a depressed teenager and a terminally ill, like, miserable 85 year old with cancer? Massive difference. Massive difference. But of course, the countries that have legalized suicide are now killing people for destitution, inadequate housing, depression, solvable problems, and they're being killed by the thousands. So I mean, that's a real thing. It's happening as we speak... So... the terminally ill thing is not. It's kind of like an irrelevant debate. Once you say it's okay to kill yourself, then you're gonna have tons of people killing themselves for reasons that. Because I'm trying to think about this in real time. Do you think if someone in Canada... says, hey, I'm terminally ill with cancer and I'm really miserable and I just feel horrible every day, what are my options?.. Do you think it should say, you know, assist, whatever they call it at this point is an option for you? I mean, if we're against killing, then we're against killing... If we're against government... killing its own citizens, then we're just going to kind of stick with that, you know what I mean? And if we're not against government killing its own citizens, then... we could easily talk ourselves into all kinds of places that are pretty dark. And with technology like this, that could happen in about 10 minutes so.. that is a. I'd like to think about that more than just a couple of minutes in an interview, but I think that is a coherent position and that could be. Do you worry about this? I mean, everybody else outside the building is terrified that this technology will... be used as a means of totalitarian control. It seems obvious that it will, but maybe you disagree. If I could get one piece of policy passed right now relative to AI, the thing I would most like, and this is in tension with some of the other things that we've talked about, is I'd like there to be a concept of AI privilege when you talk to a doctor about your health or a lawyer about your legal problems, the government cannot get that information. We have decided that society has an interest in that being privileged and that we don't and that a subpoena can't get that the government can't come asking your doctor for it. Whatever. right I think we should have the same concept for AI... I think when you talk to an AI about your medical history or your... legal problems or asking for legal advice or any of these other things, I think the government owes a level of protection to its citizens there that is the same as you'd get if you're talking to the human version of this... And right now we don't have that... And I think it would be a great, great policy to adopt. So the feds or the states or someone in authority can come to you and say, I want to know what so. And so was typing into the. Right now. They could. Yeah. And what is your obligation to keep the information that you receive from users and others... private? Well, I mean, we have an obligation, except when the government comes calling, which is why we're pushing for this. And I was actually just in D.C... advocating for this. I think I feel optimistic that we can get the government to understand the importance of this and do it. But could you ever sell that information to anyone? No. We have a privacy policy in place where we can't do that. But would it be legal to do it? I don't even think it's legal. You don't think or You know. I'm sure there's some edge casework, some information you're allowed to. But on the whole, I think we have, like, there are laws about that that are good. So all the information you receive remains with you always. It's never given to anybody else for any other reason except under subpoena. I will double check and follow up with you after to make sure there's no other reason. But that is my understanding. Okay. I mean, that's like a core question... And what about copyright? Our stance there is that fair use is actually a good law for this. The models should not be plagiarizing. The model should not be. If you write something, the model should not get to replicate that. But the model should be able to learn from and not plagiarize in the same way that people can. Have you guys ever taken copyrighted material and not paid the person who holds the copyright? I mean, we train on publicly available information, but we don't. People are annoyed with us all the time because we won't... We have a very conservative stance on what ChatGPT will say in an answer. right And so if something is even, like, close, you know, like, they're like, hey, this song can't still be in copyright. You gotta show it and we kind of famously are quite restrictive on that. So you've had. You had complaints from one programmer who said, you guys are basically stealing people's stuff and not paying them. And then he wound up murdered. What was that? Also a great tragedy. He committed suicide. Do you think he committed suicide? I really do. Have you looked into it. This was, like, a friend of mine. This is like a guy that. Not a close friend, but this is someone that worked at OpenAI for a very long time. I spent. I mean, I was really shaken by this tragedy. I spent a lot of time trying to, you know, read everything I could, as I'm sure you and others did, too, about what happened. It looks like a suicide to me. Why does it look like a suicide? It was a gun he had purchased... It was the... This is, like, gruesome to talk about, but I read the whole thats alright medical record. thats alright Does it not look like one to you? No, he was definitely murdered. I think there were signs of a struggle, of course. The surveillance camera, the wires had been cut. He had just ordered takeout food, come back from a vacation... with his friends on Catalina Island. No indication at all that he was suicidal. No note... and no behavior. He had just spoken to a family member on the phone, and then he's found dead with blood in multiple rooms. So that's impossible... Seems really obvious. He was murdered. Have you talked to the authorities about it? I have not talked to the authorities about it. And his mother claims he was murdered on your orders. Do you believe that? Well, I'm asking. I mean, you just said it. So do you... believe that? I think that it is worth looking into, and I don't. I mean, if a guy comes out and accuses your company... of... committing crimes, I have no idea if that's true or not, of course. And then is found... killed, and there are signs of a struggle, I don't think it's worth dismissing it. I don't think we should say, well, he killed himself when there's no evidence that the guy was depressed at all. I think. And if he was your friend, I would think you would want to speak to his mom or. I did offer. She didn't want to. so do you... feel that, you know, when people look at that and they're like, you know, it's possible that happened, do you feel that that reflects the worries they have about... what's happening here? Like, people are afraid that this is like. I haven't done too many interviews where I've been accused of, like, I'm not accusing you at all. I'm just saying his, his mother says that I don't think a fair read of the evidence suggests suicide at all... I just don't see that at all. And I... also don't understand... why the authorities, when... there are signs of a struggle and blood in... two rooms on a suicide, like how does that actually happen? I don't understand how the authorities could just kind of dismiss that as a suicide. I think it's weird. You understand how this sounds like an accusation. Of course. And I mean I certainly. Let me just be clear once again, not accusing you of any wrongdoing. But I think it's worth finding out what happened. And I don't understand why the city of San Francisco has refused to investigate it beyond just calling it a suicide. I mean, I think they looked into it a couple of times, more than once, as I understand it. I saw the. And I will... totally say... when I first heard about this, it sounded very suspicious. yes And I know you had been... his mother reached out to me. And I, you know, I don't know anything about it. It's not my world. She just reached out cold. She reached out cold. And. And I spoke to her at great length and it, and it scared the crap out of me. wow The kid was clearly killed by somebody. That was my conclusion, objectively. With no skin in the game. And after reading the latest report. Yes. And I immediately called a member of Congress from California, Ro Khanna, and said this is crazy. You got to look into this and nothing ever happened. And I'm like, what is that. Again? I think this is... I feel strange and sad... debating this and having to. Oh, I'm not debating And you are a little bit accusing me. the This was like a wonderful person and a family that is clearly struggling. And yes I think you can totally take the point that you're just trying to get to the truth of what happened. And I respect that. But I think his memory and his family deserve to be treated with a Level of respect and grief that I don't quite feel here. I'm asking at the behest of his family. So I'm definitely showing them respect. And I'm not accusing you of any involvement in this at all... What I am saying is that the evidence does not suggest suicide. And for the authorities in your city to allied past that... and ignore the evidence that any reasonable person would say adds up to a murder I think is very weird. And it shakes the faith that one has in... our system's ability to respond to the facts. So what I was going to say is, after the first... set of information that came out, I was really like, man, this doesn't look like a suicide. I'm confused. This looks like. Okay, okay, so I'm not reaching. I'm not being crazy here. Well, but then after the second thing came out and the more detail, I Was like, okay. what changed your mind? The second report on the way the bullet entered him and the sort of person who had, like, followed the sort of likely path of things through the room. I assume you looked at this, too. And what about that didn't change your mind? Yes, I did. It just didn't make any sense to me. Why would the security camera wires be cut? And how did he wind up bleeding in two rooms after shooting himself? And why was there a wig in the room that wasn't his? And... has there ever been a suicide where there's no indication at all that the person was suicidal? Who just ordered takeout food? I mean, who orders doordash and then shoots himself? I mean, maybe. I've covered a lot of crimes as a police reporter. I've never heard of anything like that. So, no, I was even more confused. This is where it gets into, I think, a little bit painful. Just not the level of respect I'd hope to show to someone with this kind of mental. I get it. I totally get it. It's just his family asked People commit suicide without notes. A lot like that happens. for sure. People definitely order food they like before they commit suicide. Like, this is. This is an incredible tragedy. And I. That's his family's view, and they think it was a murder... And that's why I'm asking the question. If I were his family, I am sure I would want answers. And I'm sure I would not be satisfied with really any. I mean, there's nothing that would comfort me in that, you know? right so I get it. I also care a lot about respect to him. right I have to ask, your version of Elon Musk has, like, attacked you and all this... is. What is the core of that dispute from your perspective? Look, I know he's a friend of yours, and I know what side you'll be on. I actually don't have a position on this because I don't understand it well enough to understand. He helped us start OpenAI. Very grateful for that. I really, for a long time, looked up to him as just an incredible hero and, you know, great... jewel of humanity. I have different feelings now. What are your feelings now? No longer a jewel of humanity? There are Things about him that are incredible, and I'm grateful for a lot of things he's done. There's a lot of things about him that I think are traits I don't admire. Anyway, he helped us start OpenAI, and he later decided that we weren't on a trajectory to be successful... and he didn't want to. He kind of told us we had a zero percent chance of success and he was going to go do his competitive thing. And then we did okay. And I think he got understandably upset. Like, I'd feel bad in that situation. And since then has just sort of been trying to. He had a competitive kind of clone and has been trying to sort of slow us down and sue us and do this and that. That's kind of my version of it. I'm sure you'd have a different one. You don't talk to him anymore? Very little. If AI becomes smarter, I think it already probably is smarter than... any person. And if it becomes wiser, if we can agree that it reaches... better decisions than people, then it by definition kind of displaces people at the center of the world. right I don't think it'll feel like that at all. I think it'll feel like a really smart computer that may advise us and we listen to it. Sometimes we ignore it, sometimes. it wont I don't think it'll feel like agency. I don't think it'll diminish our sense of agency. People are already using ChatGPT... in a way where many of them would say it's much smarter than me at almost everything. But they're still making decisions. They're still deciding what to ask, what to listen to, what not. And I think this is sort of just the shape of technology. Who loses their jobs because of this technology? I'll caveat this with the obvious but important statement that... no one can predict the future... And I will. I agree. And trying to. If I try to answer that precisely, I will make a lot of. I will say, like, a lot of dumb things, but I'll try to pick an area that I'm confident about and then areas that I'm much less confident about. I'm confident that a lot of current customer support that happens over a phone or computer, those people will lose their jobs, and that'll be better done by an AI. Now, there may be other kinds of customer support where you really want to know it's the right person. A job that I'm confident will not be that... impacted is like nurses. I think people really want the deep human Connection... with a person in that time and no matter how good the advice of the AI is or the robot or whatever, like... you'll really want that. A job that I feel like way less certain about what the future looks for, looks like for is computer programmers. What it means to be a computer programmer today is very different than what it meant two years ago. You're able to use these AI tools to just be hugely more productive, but it's still a person there and they're... able to generate way more code, make way more money than ever before. And it turns out that the world wanted... so much more software than the world previously had capacity to create... that there's just incredible demand overhang. But if we Fast forward another five or 10 years, what does that look like? Is it more jobs or less? That one I'm uncertain on. but there's going to be massive displacement and maybe those people will find something new and interesting and you know lucrative to do. But how big is that displacement, do you think? Someone told me recently that the historical average is about... 50% of jobs significantly change. Maybe they don't totally go away, but significantly change... every 75 years on average. That's the kind of half life of the stuff. yup and my controversial take... would be that this is going to be like a punctuated equilibrium moment where a lot of that will happen in a short period of time. But if we zoom out. it's not going to be dramatically different than the historical rate. like we'll do We'll have a lot in this short period of time and then it'll somehow be less total... job turnover than we think. There will still be a job that is, there will be some totally new categories, like my job, like... running a tech company would have been hard to think about 200 years ago. but there's a lot of other jobs... that are directionally similar to jobs that did exist 200 years ago. And there's jobs that were common 200 years ago that now aren't. And if we. Again, I have no idea if this is true or not, but I'll use the number for the sake of argument. If we assume it's... 50% turnover every 75 years. then I could totally believe a world where 75 years from now, half the people are doing something totally new... and half the people are doing something that looks kind of like some jobs of today. I mean, last time we had an industrial revolution, there was like revolution... and world wars. Do you think we'll see that... this time? Again, no one knows for sure. I'm not confident on this answer, but my Instinct is the world is so much richer now than it was at the time of the Industrial revolution that we can actually absorb more change faster than we could before. There's a lot, that's not about money, of job, there's meaning, there's belonging... to the community. Right exactly I think we're already, unfortunately, in society in a pretty bad place there. I'm not sure how much worse it can get. I'm sure It can. I have been pleasantly surprised on the ability of people to pretty quickly adapt to big changes. Like Covid was an interesting example to me of this, where the world kind of stopped all at once and the world was like very different from one week to the next... And I was very worried about how... society was going to be able to adapt to that world. And it obviously didn't go perfectly. But on the whole, I was like, all right, this is one point in favor of societal resilience. And people find new kind of ways to live their lives very quickly... I don't think AI will be nearly that abrupt. So what will be the downside? I mean, I can see the upsides for sure. Efficiency. Medical diagnosis seems like it's going to be much more accurate. Fewer lawyers. Thank you very much for that. But what are the downsides that you worry about? I think this is just how I'm wired. I always worry the most about the unknown unknowns. If it's a downside that we can really be confident about and think about. We talked about one earlier, which is these models are getting very good at bio and they could help us design biological weapons, engineer another Covid style pandemic... I worry about that. But because we worry about it, I think we and many other people in the industry are thinking hard about how to mitigate that. The unknown unknowns where, okay, there's a societal scale effect from a lot of people talking the same model at the same time... This is like a silly example, but it's one that struck me recently. LLMs like ours and our language model and others have a kind of certain style to them. They talk in a certain rhythm and they have a little bit unusual diction and maybe they overuse EM dashes and whatever. And I noticed recently that real people have picked that up and it was an example for me of like, man, you have enough people talking to the same language model... And it actually does cause a change in societal scale behavior. yes and you know did I think that ChatGPT was going to make people use way more EM dashes in real life? Certainly not... It's not a Big deal. But it's an example of where there can be these unknown unknowns of this is just like this is a brave new world. So you're saying, I think, correctly and succinctly, that technology changes human behavior. Of course, and changes our assumptions about the world and each other and all that. And a lot of this you can predict. But considering that we know that. why shouldn't the internal moral framework of the technology... be totally transparent? We prefer this to that. I mean, this is obviously a religion. I don't think you'll agree to call it that. It's very clearly a religion. To me, that's not an attack. I actually would love. I don't take that as an attack, but I would love to hear what you mean by that. Well, it's something that we assume is more powerful than people and to which we look for guidance... I mean, you're already seeing that on display. What's the right decision? I ask that question. Of whom? My closest friends, my wife and God. And this is a technology that provides a more certain answer than any person can provide. So it's a religion. And the beauty of religions is they have a catechism that is transparent. I know what the religion stands for. Here's what it's for, here's what it's against... But in this case, I pressed and I wasn't attacking you sincerely. I was not attacking you. I was trying to get to the heart of it. The beauty of religion is it admits it's a religion and it tells you what it stands for. The unsettling part of this technology, not just your company, but others, is that I don't know what it stands for. But it does stand for something. And unless it admits that and tells us what it stands for, then it guides us in a kind of stealthy way toward a conclusion we might not even know we're reaching. Do you see what I'm saying? So why not just throw it open and say, ChatGPT... is for this or for the suicide for the terminal ill But not for kids or whatever. Why don't you tell us? I mean, the reason we write this long model spec... and the reason we keep expanding over time is so that you can see here is how we intend for the model to behave. What used to happen before we had this is people would fairly say, I don't know what the model's even trying to do, and I don't know if this is a bug or the intended behavior... Tell me what this long, long document of. Tell me how you're going to, when you're going to do this and when you're going to show me this and when you're going to say you won't do that. right The reason we try to write this all out is I think people do need to know. And so is there a place you can go to find out a hard answer to what... your preferences as a company are? Preferences that are being transmitted... in a not entirely straightforward way to the globe. Where can you find out... what the company stands for, what it prefers? I mean, our model spec is the answer to that. Now, I think we will have to make it increasingly more detailed over time as people use this in different countries, there's different laws. Whatever else. Like it will not be it will not work the same way for every user everywhere. But I expect that document to get very long and very complicated. But that's why we have it. Let me ask you one last question, and maybe you can allay this fear that the power of the technology will make it difficult, impossible for anyone to discern the difference between reality and fantasy. This is... a famous concern, but because it is so skilled at mimicking people and their speech and their images that it will require some way to verify... that you are who... you say you are. That will by definition require biometrics, which will... by definition eliminate privacy for every person in the world. I don't think we... need to or should require biometrics to use the technology. I think you should just be able to use ChatGPT from any computer. Yeah, well, I strongly agree. But then at a certain point when images or sounds that mimic a person just becomes too easy to empty your checking account... with that. So what do you do about that? A few thoughts there. One, I think we are rapidly heading to a world where people understand that if you get a phone call from someone that sounds like your kid or your parent, or if you see an image that looks real, you have to really have some way to verify... that you're not being scammed. And this is not like this is no longer theoretical concern. You hear all these reports at all. Yeah. People are smart. Society is resilient. I think people are quickly understanding that this is now a thing that bad actors are using and people are understanding that you got to verify in different ways. I suspect that in addition to things like family members having code words they use in crisis situations. we'll see things like... when a president of a country has to issue an urgent message, they cryptographically sign it or otherwise somehow guarantee its authenticity. So you don't have generated videos of Trump Saying I've just done this or that. I think people are learning quickly that... this is a new thing that bad guys are doing with the technology they have to contend with. And I think that is most of the the solution which is people will have. People will by default not trust convincing looking media and we will build new mechanisms to verify authenticity of communication. But those will have to be biometric. No, not at all. I mean if, I mean like if the president of the U.S. has a urgent. I understand that but I mean for, The average day you're not sort of. Waiting for the president to... announce a war. You're... like trying to do E commerce and like how could you do. Well I think like with your family you'll have a code word that you change periodically and if you're communicating with each other and you get a call like you ask what the code word is. But that's very different than a biometric. So you don't envision. I mean to board a plane, commercial flight, you know, biometrics are part of the process now. You don't see that as becoming society wide mandatory very soon along. I really hope it doesn't become mandatory. I think there are versions of privacy preserving biometrics that I like much more than collecting a lot of personal digital information on someone. But I don't think they should be, I don't think biometrics should be mandatory. I don't think you should have to provide biometrics to get on an airplane, for example. What about to... for banking? I don't think you should have to for banking. I might prefer to like, I might prefer like you know, like a fingerprint scan to access my Bitcoin wallet than like giving all my information to a bank. But that should be a decision for me. I appreciate it. Thank you Sam Altman Thank you. So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing this show. On one level that's not surprising. That's what they do. But on another level, it's shocking. With everything that's going on in the. World right now, all the change taking. Place in our economy... and our politics, with the wars we're on the cusp. Of fighting right now, Google has decided you should have less information rather than more... And that is totally wrong. It's immoral. What can you do about it? Well, we could whine about it. That's a waste of time. We're not in charge of Google. Or we could find a way around it. A way that you could actually get. Information that is true, not intentionally deceptive... the way to do that on YouTube, we think, is to subscribe to our channel. Subscribe... Hit the little bell icon to be notified when we upload and share this video. That way you'll have a much higher chance of hearing actual news and information. So we hope that you'll do that."

      "transcript": "This is like a crazy amount of power for one piece of technology and it's happened to us so fast. You just launched GPT-5. A kid born today will never be smarter than AI. How do we figure out what's real and what's not real? We haven't put a sex bot avatar in ChatGPT yet. Super intelligence. What does that actually mean? This thing is remarkable. I'm about to interview Sam Alman, the CEO of Open AI. Open AI. Open AI. Reshaping industries. Dude's a straightup tech lord. Let's be honest. Right now, they're trying to build a super intelligence that could far exceed humans in almost every field. And they just released their most powerful model yet. Just a couple years ago, that would have sounded like science fiction. Not anymore. In fact, they're not alone. We are in the middle of the highest stakes global race any of us have ever seen. Hundreds of billions of dollars and an unbelievable amount of human worth. This is a profound moment. Most people never live through a technological shift like this, and it's happening all around you and me right now. So, in this episode, I want to try to time travel with Sam Alman into the future that he's trying to build to see what it looks like so that you and I can really understand what's coming. Welcome to Huge Conversations. How are you? Great to meet you. Thanks for doing this. Absolutely. So, before we dive in, I'd love to tell you my goal here. Okay. I'm not going to ask you about valuation or AI talent wars or fundraising or anything like that. I think that's all very well covered elsewhere. It does seem like it. Our big goal on this show is to cover how we can use science and tech to make the future better. And the reason that we do all of that is because we really believe that if people see those better futures, they can then help build them. So, my goal here is to try my best to time travel with you into different moments in the future that you're trying to build and see what it looks like. Fantastic. Awesome. Starting with what you just announced, you recently said, surprisingly recently, that GPT4 was the dumbest model any of us will ever have to use again. But GPT4 can already perform better than 90% of humans at the SAT and the LSAT and the GRE and it can pass coding exams and sommelier exams and medical licensing. And now you just launched GPT5. What can GPT5 do that GPT4 can't? First of all, one important takeaway is you can have an AI system that can do all those amazing things you just said. And it doesn't it clearly does not replicate a lot of what humans are good at doing, which I think says something about the value of SAT tests or whatever else. But I think had you gone back to if we were having this conversation the day of GPT4 launch and we told you how GPT4 did at those things, you were like, \"Oh man, this is going to have huge impacts and some negative impacts on what it means for a bunch of jobs or you know what people are going to do.\" And you know, this is a bunch of positive impacts that you might have predicted that haven't yet come true. Uh, and so there there's something about the way that these models are good that does not capture a lot of other things that we need people to to do or care about people doing. And I suspect that same thing is going to happen again with GPT5. People are going to be blown away by what it does. Uh, it's really good at a lot of things and then they will find that they want it to do even more. Um, people will use it for all sorts of incredible things. uh it will transform a lot of knowledge work, a lot of the way we learn, a lot of the way we create um but we people society will co-eolve with it to expect more with you know better tools. So yeah like I think this model is quite remarkable in many ways quite limited in others but the fact that for you know 3 minute 5 minute 1-hour tasks that uh like an expert in a in a field could maybe do or maybe struggle with that the fact that you have in your pocket one piece of software that can do all of these things is really amazing. I think this is like unprecedented at any point in human history that I that a technology has improved this much this fast and and the fact that we have this tool now, you know, we're like living through it and we're kind of adjusting step by step. But if we could go back in time five or 10 years and say this thing was coming, we would be like probably not. Let's assume that people haven't seen the headlines. What are the topline specific things that you're excited about? and also the things that you seem to be caveatting, the things that maybe you won't expect it to do. Um, the thing that I am most excited about is this is a model for the first time where I feel like I can ask kind of any hard scientific or technical question and get a pretty good answer. And I'll give a fun example actually. Uh when I was in junior high uh or maybe it was nth grade, I got a TI83, this old graphing calculator, and I spent so long making this game called Snake. Yeah. Uh it was very popular game with kids in my school. And I was I was like uh I was like pro and it was dumb, but it was like programming on TID3 was extremely painful and took a long time and it was really hard to like debug and whatever. And on a whim with an early copy of GPT5, I was like, I wonder if it can make a TI83 style Game of Snake. And of course, it did that perfectly in like 7 seconds. And then I was like, okay, am I supposed to be would my like 11-year-old self think this was cool or like, you know, miss something from the process? And I had like 3 seconds of wondering like, oh, is this good or bad? And then I immediately said, actually, now I'm missing this game. I have this idea for a crazy new feature. Let me type it in. it implements it and it just the game live updates and I'm like actually I'd like it to look this way. Actually, I'd like to do this thing and I had this like this very like kind of you have this experience that reminded me of being like 11 in programming again where I was just like I now I want to try this now I have this idea now I but I could do it so fast and I could like express ideas and try things and play with things in such real time. I was like, \"Oh man, you know, I was worried for a second about kids like missing the struggle of learning to program in this sort of stone age way.\" And now I'm just thrilled for them because the the way that people will be able to create with these new tools, the speed with which you can sort of bring ideas to life, you know, in that's that's pretty amazing. So this idea that GPT5 can just not only like answer all these hard questions for you but really create like ondemand almost instantaneous software that's I think that's going to be one of the defining elements of the GPD5 era in a way that did not exist with GPD4. As you're talking about that I find myself thinking about a concept in weightlifting of time under tension. Yeah. And for those who don't know it's you can squat 100 pounds in 3 seconds or you can squat 100 pounds in 30. You gain a lot more by squatting it in 30. And when I think about our creative process and when I've felt most like I've done my best work, it has required an enormous amount of cognitive time under tension. And I think that that cognitive time under tension is so important. And it's it's ironic almost because these tools have taken enormous cognitive time under tension to develop. But in some ways I do think people might say they're you people are using them as a escape hatch for thinking in some ways maybe. Now you might say yeah but we did that with the calculator and we just moved on to harder math problems. Do you feel like there's something different happening here? How do you think about this? It's different with I mean there are some people who are clearly using chachine not to think and there are some people who are using it to think more than they ever have before. I am hopeful that we will be able to build the tool in a way that encourages more people to stretch their brain with it a little more and be able to do more. And I think that like you know society is a competitive place like if you give people new tools uh in theory maybe people just work less but in practice it seems like people work ever harder and the expectations of people just go up. So my my guess is that like other tools uh some people like other pieces of technology some people will do more and some people will do less but certainly for the people who want to use chatbt to increase their cognitive time under tension they are really able to and it is I take a lot of inspiration from what like the top 5% of most engaged users do with chacht like it's really amazing how much people are learning and doing and you know outputting. So my I've only had GPT5 for a couple hours so I've been playing. What do you think so far? I'm I'm just learning how to interact with it. I mean part of the interesting thing is I feel like I just caught up on how to use GPT4 and now I'm trying to learn how to use GPD5. I'm curious what the specific tasks that you found most interesting are because I imagine you've been using it for a while now. I I have been most impressed by the coding tasks. I mean, there's a lot of other things it's really good at, but this this idea of the AI can write software for anything. And that means that you can express ideas in new ways that the AI can do very advanced things. It can do, you know, it can like in some sense you could like ask GPT4 anything, but because GPT5 is so good at programming, it feels like it can do anything. Of course, it can't do things in the physical world, but it can get a computer to do very complex things. And software is this super powerful, you know, way to like control some stuff and actually do some things. So, that that for me has been the most striking. Um, it's gotten it's much better at writing. So, this is like there's this whole thing of AI slop like AI writes in this kind of like quite annoying way and M dashes. M we still have the M dashes in GPT5. A lot of people like them dashes, but the writing quality of GPT5 is gotten much better. We still have a long way to go. We want to improve it more, but like uh I've a thing we've heard a lot from people inside of OpenAI is that man, they started using GPT5, they knew it was better on all the metrics, but there's this like nuance quality they can't quite articulate, but then when they have to go back to GPT4 to test something, it feels terrible. And I I don't know exactly what the cause of that is, but I suspect part of it is the writing feels so much more natural and better. I in preparation for this interview reached out to a couple other leaders in AI and technology and gathered a couple questions for you. Okay, so this next question is from Stripe CEO Patrick Collison. This will be a good one. Read this verbatim. It's about the next stage. What what comes after GBT5? In which year do you think a large language model will make a significant scientific discovery and what's missing such that it hasn't happened yet? He caveed here that we should leave math and special case models like alpha fold aside. He's specifically asking about fully general purpose models like the GPT series. I would say most people will agree that that happens at some point over the next two years. But the definition of significant matters a lot. And so some people significant might happen, you know, in early 25. Some people might maybe not until late 2026. Sorry, early 2026. Maybe some people not until late 2027, but I would I would bet that by late 27, most people agree that there has been an AIdriven significant new discovery. And the thing that I think is missing is just the kind of cognitive power of these models. A framework that one of the researchers said to me that I really liked is, you know, a year ago we could do well on like a high school like a basic high school math competition problems that might take a professional mathematician seconds to a few minutes. We very recently got an IMO gold medal. That is a crazy difficult like could you explain what that means? That's kind of like the hardest competition math test. This is something that like the very very top slice of the world. many many professional mathematicians wouldn't solve a single problem and we scored at the top level. Now there are some humans that got an even higher score in the gold medal range but we we like this is a crazy accomplishment and these each of these problems it's like six problems over 9 hours so hour and a half per problem for a great mathematician. So we've gone from a few seconds to a few minutes to an hour and a half maybe to prove a significant new mathematical theorem is like a thousand hours of work for a top person in the world. So we've got to go from, you know, another significant gain. But if you look at our trajectory, you can say like, okay, we're getting to that. We have a path to get to that time horizon. We just need to keep scaling the models. The long-term future that you've described is super intelligence. What does that actually mean? And how will we know when we've hit it? If we had a system that could do better research, better AI research than uh say the whole open AI research team, like if we were willing, if we said, \"Okay, the best way we can use our GPUs is to let this AI decide what experiments we should run smarter than like the whole brain trust of Open AAI.\" Yeah. And if that same to make a personal example, if that same system could do a better job running open AI than I could. So you have something that's like, you know, better than the best researchers, better than me at this, better than other people at their jobs, that would feel like super intelligence to me. That is a sentence that would have sounded like science fiction just a couple years ago. And now it kind of does, but it's you can like see it through the fog. Yes. And so one of the steps it sounds like you're saying on that path is this moment of scientific discovery of asking better questions of grappling with things in a in a way that expert level humans do to come up with new discoveries. One of the things that keeps knocking around in my head is if we were in 1899 say and we were able to give it all of physics up until that point and play it out a little bit. Nothing further than that. Like at what point would one of these systems come up with general relativity? Interesting question is did you like if we think about that forward like like if we think of where we are now should a if if we never got another piece of physics data. Yeah. Do we expect that a really good super intelligence could just think super hard about our existing data and maybe say like solve high energy physics with no new particle accelerator or does it need to build a new one and design new experiments? Obviously we don't know the answer to that. Different people have different speculation. Uh but I suspect we will find that for a lot of science, it's not enough to just think harder about data we have, but we will need to build new instruments, conduct new experiments, and that will take some time. Like that that is the real world is slow and messy and you know whatever. So I'm sure we could make some more progress just by thinking harder about the current scientific data we have in the world. But my guess is to make the big progress we'll also need to build new machines and run new experiments and there will be some slowdown built into that. Another way of of thinking about this is AI systems now are just incredibly good at answering almost any question. But maybe one of the things we're saying is it's another leap yet. And what Patrick's question is getting at is to ask the better questions. Or or if we go back to this kind of timeline question, we could maybe say that AI systems are superhuman on one minute tasks, but a long way to go to the thousand hour tasks. And there's a dimension of human intelligence that seems very different than AI systems when it comes to these long horizon tasks. Now, I think we will figure it out, but today it's a real weak point. We've talked about where we are now with GBC5. We talked about the end goal or future goal of super intelligence. One of the questions that I have, of course, is what does it look like to walk through the fog between the two. The next question is from Nvidia CEO Jensen Hong. I'm going to read this verbatim. Fact is what is. Truth is what it means. So facts are objective. Truths are personal. They depend on perspective, culture, values, beliefs, context. One AI can learn and know the facts. But how does one AI know the truth for everyone in every country and every background? I'm going to accept as axioms those definitions. I'm not sure if I agree with them, but in the issues of time, I will just take them. I will take those definitions and go with it. Um, I have been surprised, I think many other people have been surprised too about how fluent AI is at adapting to different cultural contexts and individuals. One of my favorite features that we have ever launched in chatbt is the the sort of enhanced memory that came out earlier this year. like it really feels like my Chad GBT gets to know me and what I care about and like my life experiences and background and the things that have led me to where they are. A friend of mine recently who's been a huge CHBT user, so he's got a lot of a a lot of he's put a lot of his life into all these conversations. He gave his Chad GBT a bunch of personality tests and asked them to answer as if they were him and it got the same scores he actually got, even though he'd never really talked about his personality. And my ChachiBD has really learned over the years of me talking to it about my culture, my values, my life. And I have used, you know, I sometimes will use it in like uh I'll use like a free account just to see what it's like without any of my history and it feels really really different. So I think we've all been surprised on the upside of how good AI is at learning this and adapting. And so do you envision in many different parts of the world people using different AIs with different sort of cultural norms and contexts? Is that what we're saying? I think that everyone will use like the same fundamental model, but there will be context provided to that model that will make it behave in sort of personalized way they want their community wants. Whatever. I think when we're getting at this idea of facts and truth and uh it brings me to this seems like a good moment for our first time travel trip. Okay, we're going to 2030. This is a serious question, but I want to ask it with a light-hearted example. Have you seen the bunnies that are jumping on the trampoline? Yes. So, for those who haven't seen it, maybe it looks like backyard footage of bunnies enjoying jumping on a trampoline. And this has gone incredibly viral recently. There's a humanmade song about it. It's a whole thing. There were a trampoline. And I think the reason why people reacted so strongly to it, it was maybe the first time people saw a video, enjoyed it, and then later found out that it was completely AI generated. In this time travel trip, if we imagine in 2030, we are teenagers and we're scrolling whatever teenagers are scrolling in 2030. How do we figure out what's real and what's not real? I mean, I can give all sorts of literal answers to that question. We could be cryptographically signing stuff and we could decide who we trust their signature if they actually filmed something or not. But but my sense is what's going to happen is it's just going to like gradually converge. You know, even like a photo you take out of your iPhone today, it's like mostly real, but it's a little not. There's like in some AI thing running there in a way you don't understand and making it look like a little bit better and sometimes you see these weird things where the moon. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But there's like a lot of processing power between the photons captured by that camera sensor and the image you eventually see. And you've decided it's real enough or most people decided it's real enough. But we've accepted some gradual move from when it was like photons hitting the film in a camera. And you know, if you go look at some video on Tik Tok, there's probably all sorts of video editing tools being used to make it better than real look. Yeah, exactly. Or it's just like, you know, whole scenes are completely generated or some of the whole videos are generated like those bunnies on that trampoline. And and I think that the the sort of like the threshold for how real does it have to be to consider to be real will just keep moving. So it's sort of a education question. It's a people will Yeah. I mean media is always like a little bit real and a little bit not real. Like you know we watch like a sci-fi movie. We know that didn't really happen. You watch like someone's like beautiful photo of themselves on vacation on Instagram. like, okay, maybe that photo was like literally taken, but you know, there's like tons of tourists in line for the same photo and that's like left out of it. And I think we just accept that now. Certainly, a higher percentage of media both will will feel not real. Um, but I think that's been the long-term trend. Anyway, we're going to jump again. Okay, 2035, we're graduating from college, you and me. There are some leaders in the AI space that have said that in 5 years half of the entry level white collar workforce will be replaced by AI. So we're college graduates in 5 years. What do you hope the world looks like for us? I think there's been a lot of talk about how AI might cause job displacement, but I'm also curious. I have a job that nobody would have thought we could have, you know, totally a decade ago. What are the things that we could look ahead if we're thinking about in 2035 that like graduating college student, if they still go to college at all, could very well be like leaving on a mission to explore the solar system on a spaceship in some kind of completely new exciting, super well- paid, super interesting job and feeling so bad for you and I that like we had to do this kind of like really boring old kind of work and everything is just better. Like I I 10 years feels very hard to imagine at this point because it's too far. It's too far. If you compound the current rate of change for 10 more years, it's probably something we can't even time travel trips. I 10 like I mean I think now would be really hard to imagine 10 years ago. Yeah. Uh but I think 10 years forward will be even much harder, much more different. So let's make it 5 years. We're still going to 2030. I'm curious what you think the pretty short-term impacts of this will be for for young people. I mean, these like half of entry- level jobs replaced by AI makes it sound like a very different world that they would be entering than the one that I did. Um, I think it's totally true that some classes of jobs will totally go away. This always happens and young people are the best at adapting to this. I'm more worried about what it means, not for the like 22-y old, but for the 62-y old that doesn't want to go re retrain or reskill or whatever the politicians call it that no one actually wants but politicians and most of the time. If I were 22 right now and graduating college, I would feel like the luckiest kid in all of history. Why? Because there's never been a more amazing time to go create something totally new, to go invent something, to start a company, whatever it is. I think it is probably possible now to start a company that is a oneperson company that will go on to be worth like more than a billion dollars and more importantly than that deliver an amazing product and service to the world and that that is like a crazy thing. You have access to tools that can let you do what used to take teams of hundreds and you just have to like you know learn how to use these tools and come up with a great idea and it's it's like quite amazing. If we take a step back, I think the most important thing that this audience could hear from you on this optimistic show is in two parts. First, there's tactically, how are you actually trying to build the world's most powerful intelligence and what are the rate limiting factors to doing that? And then philosophically, how are you and others working on building that technology in a way that really helps and not hurts people? So just taking the tactical part right now. My understanding is that there are three big categories that have been limiting factors for AI. The first is compute, the second is data and the third is algorithmic design. How do you think about each of those three categories right now? And if you were to help someone understand the next headlines that they might see, how would you help them make sense of all this? I I would say there's a fourth too which is uh figuring out the products to build like techn like scientific progress on its own not put into the hands of people is of limited utility and doesn't sort of co-evolve with society in the same way but if I could hit all four of those um so on the compute side yeah this is like the biggest infrastructure project certainly that I've ever seen possibly it will become the I think it will maybe already is the biggest and most expensive one in human history but the the whole supply chain from making the chips and the memory and the networking gear, racking them up in servers, doing, you know, a giant construction project to build like a mega mega data center, putting the, you know, finding a way to get the energy, which is often a limiting factor piece of this and all the other components together. This is hugely complex and expensive. And we are we're still doing this in like a sort of bespoke one-off way although it's getting better. Like eventually we will just design a whole kind of like mega factory that takes you know I mean spiritually it will be melting sand on one end and putting out fully built AI compute on the other but we are a long way to go from that and it's a it's an enormously complex and expensive process. uh we are putting a huge amount of work into building out as much compute as we can and to do it fast and you know it's going to be like sad because GP5 is going to launch and there's going to be another big spike in demand and we're not going to be able to serve it and it's going to be like those early GPD4 days and the world just wants much more AI than we can currently deliver and building more compute is an important part of doing that. That's actually this is what I expect to turn the majority of my attention to is how we build compute at much greater scales. Uh so how we go from millions to tens of millions and hundreds of millions and eventually hopefully billions of GPUs that are sort of in service of what people want to do with this. When you're thinking about it, what are the big challenges here in this category that you're going to be thinking about? We're currently most limited by energy. um you know like if you're gonna you want to run a gigawatt scale data center it's like a gigawatt how hard can that be to find it's really hard to find a gigawatt of power available in short term we're also very much limited by the processing chips and the memory chips uh how you package these all together how you build the racks and then there's like a list of other things that are you know there's like permits there's construction work uh but but again the goal here will be to really automate this once we get some of those robots built, they can help us automate it even more. But just, you know, like a world where you can basically pour in money and get out a pre-built data center. Uh so that'll be that'll be a huge unlock if we can get it to work. Second category, data. Yeah, these models have gotten so smart. There was a time when we could just feed it another physics textbook and got a little bit smarter at physics, but now like honestly GBT5 understands everything in a physics textbook pretty well. We're excited about synthetic data. We're very excited about our users helping us create harder and harder tasks and environments to go off and have the system solve. But uh I think we're data will always be important, but we're entering a realm where the models need to learn things that don't exist in any data set yet. They have to go discover new things. So that's like a crazy new How do you teach a model to discover new things? Well, humans can do it. like we can go off and come up with hypotheses and test them and get experimental results and update on what we learn. So probably the same kind of way. And then there's algorithmic design. Yeah, we've made huge progress on algorithmic design. Uh the thing that the thing that I think open does best in the world is we have built this culture of repeated and big algorithmic research gains. So we kind of you know figured out the what became the GPT paradigm. We figured out became the reasoning paradigm. We're working on some new ones now. Um, but it is very exciting to me to think that there are still many more orders of magnitudes of algorithmic gains ahead of us. We we just yesterday uh released a model called GPOSS, open source model. It's a model that is as smart as 04 Mini, which is a very smart model that runs locally on a laptop. And this blows my mind. Yeah. Like if you had asked me a few years ago when we'd have a model of that intelligence running on a laptop, I would have said many many years in the future. But then we we found some algorithmic gains um particularly around reasoning but also some other things that let us do a a tiny model that can do this amazing thing. And you know those are those are the most fun things. That's like kind of the coolest part of the job. I can see you really enjoying thinking about this. I'm curious for people who don't quite know what you're talking about, who aren't familiar with how an algorithmic design would lead to a better experience that they actually use. Could you summarize the state of things right now? Like what what is it that you're thinking about when you're thinking about how fun this problem is? Let me start back in history and then I'll get to some things for today. So, GPT1 was an idea at the time that was quite mocked by a lot of experts in the field, which was can we train a model to play a little game, which is show it a bunch of words and have it guess the one that comes next in the sequence. That's called unsupervised learning. There's not you're not really saying like this is a cat, this is a dog. You're saying here's some words, guess the next one. And the fact that that can go learn these very complicated concepts that can go learn all the stuff about physics and math and programming and keep predicting the word that comes next and next and next and next seemed ludicrous, magical, unlikely to work. Like how was that all going to get encoded? And yet humans do it. you know, babies start hearing language and figure out what it means kind of largely uh or at least to some significant degree on their own. And and so we did it and then we also realized that if we scaled it up, it got better and better, but we had to scale over many many orders of magnitude. So it wasn't that good in the GPT1 day. It wasn't good at all in the GPT1 days. And a lot of experts in the field said, \"Oh, this is ridiculous. It's never going to work. It's not going to be robust.\" But we had these things called scaling laws. And we said, \"Okay, so this gets predictably better as we increase compute, memory, data, whatever. And we can we can decide we can use those predictions to make decisions about how to scale this up and do it and get great results.\" And that has worked over Yeah. a crazy number of orders of magnitude. And it was so not obvious at the time. like that was that was I think the the reason the world was so surprised is that that seemed like such an unlikely finding. Another one was that we could use these language models with reinforcement learning where we're saying this is good, this is bad to teach it how to reason. And this led to the 01 and 03 and now the GBT5 progress. And that that was another thing that felt like uh if it works it's really great but like no way this is going to work. It's too simple. And now we're on to new things. We've figured out how to make much better video models. We are we are discovering new ways to use new kinds of data and environment to kind of scale that up as well. Um and I think again you know 5 10 years out that's too hard to say in this field but the next couple of years we have very smooth very strong scaling in front of us. I think it has become a sort of public narrative that we are on this smooth path from one to two to three to four to five to more. Yeah. But it also is true behind the scenes that it's a it's not linear like that. It's messier. Tell us a little bit about the mess before GPT5. What was what were the interesting problems that you needed to solve? Um, we did a model called Orion that we released as GPT 4.5. And we had we did too big of a model. It was just it was it's a very cool model, but it's unwieldly to use. And we realized that for kind of some of the research we need to do on top of a model, we need a different shape. So we we followed one scaling law that kept being good without without really internalizing. There was a new even steeper scaling law that we got better returns for compute on, which was this reasoning thing. So that was like one alley we went down and turned around, but that's fine. That's part of research. Um, we had some problems with the way we think about our data sets as these models like really have to get get this big and um, you know, learn from this much data. So So yeah, I think like in the in the middle of it in the day-to-day, you kind of you make a lot of U-turns as you try things or you have an architecture idea that doesn't work, but the the aggregate the summation of all the squiggles has been remarkably smooth on the exponential. One of the things I always find interesting is that by the time I'm sitting here interviewing you about the thing that you just put out, you're thinking about Exactly. What are the things that you can share that are at least the problems that you're thinking about that I would be interviewing you about in a year if I came back? I mean, possibly you'll be asking me like, what does it mean that this thing can go discover new science? Yeah. What how how is the world supposed to think about GPT6 discovering new science? Now, maybe not like maybe we don't deliver that, but it feels within grasp. If you did, what would you say? What would your what would the implications of that kind of achievement be? Imagine you do succeed. Yeah. I mean, I think the great parts will be great. the bad parts will be scary and the bizarre parts will be like bizarre on the first day and then we'll get used to them really fast. So we'll be like, \"Oh, it's incredible that this is like being used to cure disease and be like, oh, it's extremely scary that models like this are being used to like create new biocurity threats.\" And then we'll also be like, man, it's really weird to like live through watching the world speed up so much and you know the economy grows so fast and the like it will feel like vertigo inducing uh the sort of the rate of change and then like happens with everything else the remarkable ability of of people of humanity to adapt to kind of like any amount of change. we'll just be like, \"Okay, you know, this is like this is it.\" Um, a kid born today will never be smarter than AI ever. And a kid born today, by the time that kid like kind of understands the way the world works, will just always be used to an incredibly fast rate of things improving and discovering new science. They will just they will never know any other world. It will seem totally natural. will seem unthinkable and stone age like that we used to use computers or phones or any kind of technology that was not way smarter than we were. You know, we will think like how bad those people of the 2020s had it. I'm thinking about having kids. You should. It's the best thing ever. I know you just had your first kid. How does what you just said affect how I should think about parenting a kid in that world? What advice would you give me? Probably nothing different than the way you've been parenting kids for tens of thousands of years. Like love your kids, show them the world, like support them in whatever they want to do and teach them like how to be a good person. And that probably is what's going to matter. It sounds a little bit like some of the you know you've said a couple of things like this that that you know you might not go to college you might there there are a couple of things that you've said so far that feed into this I think and it sounds like what you're saying is there will be more optionality for them in a in a world that you envision and therefore they will have more more ability to say I want to build this here's the superpowered tool that will help me do that or yeah like I want my kid to think I had a terrible constrained life and that he has this incredible infinite canvas of stuff to do that that that is like the way of the world. We've said that uh 2035 is a little bit too far in the future to think about. So maybe this this was going to be a jump to 2040 but maybe it will keep it shorter than that. When I think about the area where AI could have for both our kids and us the biggest genuinely positive impact on all of us, it's health. So if we are in pick your year, call it 2035 and I'm sitting here and I'm interviewing the dean of Stanford medicine, what do you hope that he's telling me AI is doing for our health in 2035? Start with 2025. Okay. Um yeah, please. One of the things we are most proud of with GPT5 is how much better it's gotten at health advice. Um, people have used the GPT4 models a lot for health advice. And you know, I'm sure you've seen some of these things on the internet where people are like, I had this life-threatening disease and no doctor could figure it out and I like put my symptoms and a blood test into CHBT. It told me exactly the rare thing I had. I went to a doctor. I took a pill. I'm cured. Like that's amazing. obviously and a huge fraction of ChatGpt queries are health related. So we wanted to get really good at this and we invested a lot in GPT5 is significantly better at healthcare related queries. What does better mean here? It gives you a better answer just more accurate more accurate hallucinates less uh more likely to like tell you what you actually have what you actually should do. Um, yeah, and better healthcare is wonderful, but obviously what people actually want is to just not have disease. And by 2035, I think we will be able to use these tools to cure a significant number or at least treat a significant number of diseases that currently plague us. I think that'll be one of the most viscerally felt benefits of of AI. People talk a lot about how AI will revolutionize healthcare, but I'm curious to go one turn deeper on specifically what you're imagining. Like, is it that these AI systems could have helped us see GLP-1s earlier, this medication that has been around for a long time, but we didn't know about this other effect? Is it that, you know, alpha fold and protein folding is helping create new medicines? I would like to be able to ask GBT 8 to go cure a particular cancer and I would like GPT8 to go off and think and then say uh okay I read everything I could find. I have these ideas. I need you to uh go get a lab technician to run these nine experiments and tell me what you find for each of them. And you know wait 2 months for the cells to do their thing. Send the results back to GBT8. Say I tried it. Here you go. Think think. Say okay I just need one more experiment. That was a surprise. Run one more experiment. Give it back. GPT says, \"Okay, go synthesize this molecule and try, you know, mouse studies or whatever.\" Okay, that was good. Like, try human studies. Okay, great. It worked. Um, here's how to like run it through the FDA. I think anyone with a loved one who's died of cancer would also really like that. Okay, we're going to jump again. Okay. I was going to say 2050, but again, all of my timelines are getting much, much shorter. But I It does feel like the world's going very fast now. It does. Yeah. And when I talk to other leaders in AI, one of the things that they refer to is the industrial revolution. They say, \"I chose 2050 because I've heard people talk about how by then the change that we will have gone through will be like the industrial revolution, but quote 10 times bigger and 10 times faster.\" The industrial revolution gave us modern medicine and sanitation and transportation and mass production and all all of the conveniences that we now take for granted. It also was incredibly difficult for a lot of people for about 100 years. If this is going to be 10 times bigger and 10 times faster if we keep reducing the timelines that we're talking about here, even in this conversation, what does that actually feel like for most people? And I think what I'm trying to get at is if this all goes the way you hope, who still gets hurt in the meantime? I don't I don't really know what this is going to feel like to live through. Um I think we're in uncharted waters here. Uh I do believe in like human adaptability and sort of infinite creativity and desire for stuff and I think we always do figure out new things to do but the transition period if this happens as fast as it might and I don't think it will happen as fast as like some of my colleagues say the technology will but society has like a lot of inertia. Mhm. people adapt their way of living. Yeah. Surprisingly slowly. There are to classes of jobs that are going to totally go away and there will be many classes of jobs that change significantly and there'll be the new things in the same way that your job didn't exist some time ago. Neither did mine. And in some sense, this has been going on for a long time. And you know, it's it's still disruptive to individuals, but society has gotten has proven quite resilient to this. And then in some other sense like we have no idea how far or fast this could go. And thus I think we need an unusual degree of humility and openness to considering new solutions that would have seemed way out of the Overton window not too long ago. I'd like to talk about what some of those could be because I'm not a historian by any means, but the first industrial revolution, my understanding is led to a lot of public health implementations because public health got so bad. Led to modern sanitation because public health got so bad. The second industrial revolution led to workforce protections because labor conditions got so bad. Every big leap creates a mess and that mess needs to be cleaned up and and we've done that. And I'm curious, this is going to be it sounds like an we're in the middle of this enormously. How specific can we get as early as possible about what that mess can be? What what are the public interventions that we could do ahead of time to reduce the mess that we think that we're headed for? I would again c I'm going to speculate for fun but caveed by I'm not an economist even uh much less someone who can see the future. I I it seems to me like something fundamental about the social contract may have to change. It may not. It may it may be that like actually capitalism works as it's been working surprisingly well and like demand supply balances do their thing and we all just figure out kind of new jobs and new ways to transfer value to each other. But it seems to me likely that we will decide we need to think about how access to this maybe most important resource of the future gets shared. The best thing that it seems to me to do is to make AI compute as abundant and cheap as possible such that we're just like there's way too much and we run out of like good new ideas to really use it for and it's just like anything you want is happening. Without that, I can see like quite literal wars being fought over it. But, you know, new ideas about how we distribute access to AGI compute, that seems like a really great direction, like a crazy but important thing to think about. One of the things that I find myself thinking about in this conversation is we often ascribe almost full responsibility of the AI future that we've been talking about to the companies building AI, but we're the ones using it. We're the ones electing people that will regulate it. And so I'm curious, this is not a question about specific, you know, federal regulation or anything like that, although if you have an answer there, I'm curious. But what would you ask of the rest of us? What is the shared responsibility here? And how can we act in a way that would help make the optimistic version of this more possible? My favorite historical example for the AI revolution is the transistor. It was this amazing piece of science that some science brilliant scientists discovered. It scaled incredibly like AI does and it made its way relatively quickly into every many things that we use. um your computer, your phone, that camera, that light, whatever. And it was a it was a real unlock for the tech tree of humanity. And there were a period in time where probably everybody was really obsessed with the transistor companies, the semiconductors of, you know, Silicon Valley back when it was Silicon Valley. But now you can maybe name a couple of companies that are transistor companies, but mostly you don't think about it. Mostly it's just seeped everywhere. in Silicon Valley is, you know, like probably someone graduating from college barely remembers why it was called that in the first place. And you don't think that it was those transistor companies that shaped society even though they did something important. You think about what Apple did with the iPhone and then you think about what Tik Tok built on top of the iPhone and you're like, \"All right, here's this long chain of all these people that nudged society in some way and what our governments did or didn't do and what the people using these technologies did.\" And I think that's what will happen with AI. Like back, you know, kids born today, they they never knew the world without AI. So they don't really think about it. It's just this thing that's going to be there in everything. and and they will think about like the companies that built on it and what they did with it and the kind of like political leaders the decisions they made that maybe they wouldn't have been able to do without AI but they will still think about like what this president or that president did and you know the role of the AI companies is all these companies and people and institutions before us built up this scaffolding we added our one layer on top and now people get to stand on top of that and add one layer and the next and the next and many more And that is the beauty of our society. We kind of all I I love this like idea that society is the super intelligence. Like no one person could do on their own, what they're able to do with all of the really hard work that society has done together to like give you this amazing set of tools. And that's what I think it's going to feel like. It's going to be like, all right, you know, yeah, some nerds discovered this thing and that was great and you know, now everybody's doing all these amazing things with it. So maybe the ask to millions of people is build on it. Well, in my own life, that is the feel as like this important societal contract. All these people came before you. They worked incredibly hard. They like put their brick in the path of human progress and you get to walk all the way down that path and you got to put one more and somebody else does that and somebody else does that. This does feel I've done a couple of interviews with folks who have really made cataclysmic change. The one I'm thinking about right now is with uh crisper pioneer Jennifer Dana and it did feel like that was also what she was saying in some way. She had discovered something that really might change the way that most people relate to their health moving forward. And there will be a lot of people that will use what she has done in ways that she might approve of or not approve of. And it was really interesting. I'm hearing some similar themes of like, man, I I hope that this I hope that the next person takes the baton and runs with it well. Yeah. But that's been working for a long time. Not all good, but mostly good. I think there's a there's a big difference between winning the race and building the AI future that would be best for the most people. And I can imagine that it is easier maybe more quantifiable sometimes to focus on the next way to win the race. And I'm curious when those two things are at odds. What is an example of a decision that you've had to make that is best for the world but not best for winning? I think there are a lot. So, one of the things that we are most proud of is many people say that ChachiBt is their favorite piece of technology ever and that it's the one that they trust the most, rely on the most, whatever. And this is a little bit of a ridiculous statement because AI is the thing that hallucinates. AI has all of these problems, right? But we have screwed some things up along the way, sometimes big time, but on the whole, I think as a user of Chachib, you get the feeling that like it's trying to help you. It's trying to like help you accomplish whatever you ask. It's it's very aligned with you. It's not trying to get you to like, you know, use it all day. It's not trying to like get you to buy something. It's trying to like kind of help you accomplish whatever your goals are. And and that is that's like a very special relationship we have with our users. We do not take it lightly. There's a lot of things we could do that would like grow faster, that would get more time in chatbt uh that we don't do because we know that like our long-term incentive is to stay as aligned with our users as possible. And but there's a lot of short-term stuff we could do that would like really like juice growth or revenue or whatever and be very misaligned with that long-term goal. And I'm proud of the company and how little we get distracted by that. But sometimes we do get tempted. Are there specific examples that come to mind? Any like decisions that you've made? Um well, we haven't put a sex bot avatar in Chbt yet. That does seem like it would get time spent. Apparently, it does. I'm gonna ask my next question. Um, it's been a really crazy few years. You know, it and somehow one of the things that keeps coming back is that it feels like we're in the first inning. Yeah. And one of the things that I would say we're out of the first inning. Out of the first inning, I would say second inning. I mean, you have GPT5 on your phone and it's like smarter than experts in every field. That's got to be out of the first name. But maybe there are many more to come. Yeah. And I'm curious, it seems like you're going to be someone who is leading the next few. What is a way, what is a learning from inning one or two or a mistake that you made that you feel will affect how you play in the next? I think the worst thing we've done in ChachiBT so far is uh we had this issue with sickency where the model was kind of being too flattering to users and for some users it was most users it was just annoying but for some users that had like fragile mental states it was encouraging delusions that was not the top risk we were worried about. It was not the thing we were testing for the most. was on our list, but the thing that actually became the safety failing of ChachiBT was not the one we were spending most of our time talking about, which should be bioweapons or something like that. And I think it was a great reminder of we now have a service that is so broadly used in some sense, society is co-evolving with it. And when we think about these changes and we think about the unknown unknowns, we have to operate in a different way and have like a wider aperture to what we think about as our top risks. In a recent interview with Theo Vaughn, you said something that I found really interesting. You said there are moments in the history of science where you have a group of scientists look at their creation and just say, \"What have we done?\" When have you felt that way? Most concerned about the creation that you've built? Um and then my next question will be it's opposite. When have you felt most proud? I mean there have been these moments of awe where uh we just not like what have we done in a bad way but like this thing is remarkable. Like I remember the first time we talked to like GPT4 was like wow this is really like this is this is an amazing accomplishment of this group of people that have been like pouring their life force into this for so long. on a what have we done moment. There was I was talking to a researcher recently. You know, there will probably come a time where our systems are I don't want to say sane, let's say emitting more words per day than all people do. Um, and you know already like our people are sending billions of messages a day to chatbt and getting responses that they rely on for work or their life or whatever the and you know like one researcher can make some small tweak to how Chad GPT talks to you or talks to everybody and and that's just an enormous amount of power for like one individual making a small tweak to the model personality. Yeah. like no no no person in history has been able to have billions of conversations a day and so you know somebody could do something but but this is like just thinking about that really hit me of like this is like a crazy amount of power for one piece of technology to have and like we got to and this happened to us so fast that we got to like think about what it means to make a personality change to the model at this kind of scale and uh yeah that was like a moment that hit me What was your next set of thoughts? I'm so curious how you think about this. Well, just because of like who that person was like we we very we very much flipped into like what are the sort of like it it could have been a very different conversation with somebody else. But in this case it was like what is a what do a good set of procedures look like? How do we think about how we want to test something? How do we think about how we want to communicate it? But with somebody else it could have gone in a like very philosophical direction. And it could have gone in like a what kind of research do we like want to do to go understand what these changes are going to make? Do we want to do it differently for different people? So that it went that way but mostly just because of who I was talking to. To combine what you're saying now with your last answer, one of the things that I have heard about GBC5 and I'm still playing with it is that it is supposed to be less effusively uh you know less of a yes man. Two questions. What do you think are are the implications of that? It sounds like you are answering that a little bit, but also how do you actually guide it to be less like that? Here is a heartbreaking thing. I think it is great that chatbt is less of a yes man and gives you more critical feedback. But as we've been making those changes and talking to users about it, it's so sad to hear users say like, \"Please can I have it back? I've never had anyone in my life be supportive of me. I never had a parent telling me I was doing a good job.\" Like I can get why this was bad for other people's mental health, but this was great for my mental health. Like I didn't realize how much I needed this. It encouraged me to do this. It encouraged me to make this change in my life. Like it's not all bad for chatbt to it turns out like be encouraging of you. Now the way we were doing it was bad, but turn it like something in that direction might have some value in it. How we do it, we we show the model examples of how we'd like it to respond in different cases and from that it learns the sort of the overall personality. What haven't I asked you that you're thinking about a lot that you want people to know? I feel like we covered a lot of ground. Me, too. But I want to know if there's anything on your mind. I don't think so. One of the things that I haven't gotten to play with yet, but I'm curious about is GBT5 being much more in my life, meaning like in my Gmail and my calendar and my like I've been using GBT4 mostly as a isolated relationship with it. Yeah. How would I expect my relationship to change with GBC 5? Exactly what you said. I think it'll just start to feel integrated in all of these ways. you'll connect it to your calendar and your Gmail and it'll say like, \"Hey, do you want me to I noticed this thing. Do you want me to do this thing for you over time, it'll start to feel way more proactive. Um, so maybe you wake up in the morning and it says, \"Hey, this happened overnight. I noticed this change on your calendar. I was thinking more about this question you asked me. I have this other idea.\" And then you know eventually we'll make some consumer devices and it'll sit here during this interview and you know maybe it'll leave us alone during it but after it'll say that was great but next time you should have asked Sam this or when you brought this up like you know he kind of didn't give you a good answer so like you should really drill him on that and it'll just feel like it kind of becomes more like this entity that is this companion with you throughout your day. We've talked about kids and college graduates and parents and all kinds of different people. If we imagine a wide set of people listening to this, they've come to the end of this conversation. They are hopefully feeling like they maybe see visions of moments in the future a little bit better. What advice would you give them about how to prepare? The number one piece of tactical advice is just use the tools. Like the the number of people that I have the the most common question I get asked about AI is like what should I how should I help my kids prepare for the world? What should I tell my kids? The second most question is like how do I invest in this AI world? But stick with that first one. Um I am surprised how many people ask that and have never tried using Chachi PT for anything other than like a better version of a Google search. And so the number one piece of advice that I give is just try to like get fluent with the capability of the tools. figure out how to like use this in your life. Figure out what to do with it. And I think that's probably the most important piece of tactical advice. You know, go like meditate, learn how to be resilient and deal with a lot of change. There's all that good stuff, too. But just using the tools really helps. Okay. I have one more question that I wasn't planning to ask, but I just Great. In in doing all of this research beforehand, I spoke to a lot of different kinds of folks. I spoke to a lot of people that were building tools and using them. I spoke to a lot of people that were actually in labs and and trying to build what we have defined as super intelligence. And it did seem like there were these two camps forming. There's a group of people who are using the tools like you in this conversation and building tools for others saying this is going to be a really useful future that we're all moving toward. Your life is going to be full of choice and we've talked about our my potential kids and and their futures. Then there's another camp of people that are building these tools that are saying it's going to kill us all. And I'm curious how that cultural disconnect has like what am I missing about those two groups of people? It's so hard for me to like wrap my head around like there are you are totally right. There are people who say this is going to kill us all and yet they still are working 100 hours a week to build it. Yes. And I I can't I can't really put myself in the headsp space. If if that's what I really truly believed, I don't think I'd be trying to build it. One would think, you know, maybe I would be like on a farm trying to like live out my last days. Maybe I would be trying to like advocate for it to be stopped. Maybe I would be trying to like work more on safety, but I don't think I'd be trying to build it. So, I find myself just having a hard time empathizing with that mindset. I assume it's true. I assume it's in good faith. I assume there's just like there's some psychological issue there I don't understand about how they make it all make sense, but it's very strange to me. Do you do you have an opinion? You know, because I I always do this. I ask for sort of a general future and then I try to press on specifics. And when you ask people for specifics on how it's going to kill us all, I mean, I don't think we need to get into this on an optimistic show, but you hear the same kinds of refrains. You think about, you know, something uh trying to accomplish a task and then over accomplishing that task. Um you hear about sort of I've heard you talk about a sort of general um over reliance of sort of an understanding that the president is going to be a a AI and and maybe that is an overreliance that we, you know, would need to think about. And you know, you you play out these different scenarios, but then you ask someone why they're working on it, or you ask someone how how they think this will play out, and I just maybe I haven't spoken to enough people yet. Maybe I don't fully understand this this cultural conversation that's happening. Um or maybe it really is someone who just says 99% of the time I think it's going to be incredibly good. 1% of the time I think it might be a disaster trying to make the best world. That I can totally if you're like, hey, 99% chance incredible. 1% chance the world gets wiped out. And I really want to work to maximize to move that 99 to 99.5. That I can totally understand. Yeah, that makes sense. I've been doing an interview series with some of the most important people influencing the future. Not knowing who the next person is going to be, but knowing that they will be building something totally fascinating in the future that we've just described. Is there a question that you'd advise me to ask the next person not knowing who it is? I'm always interested in the like without knowing anything about the I'm always interested in the like of all of the things you could spend your time and energy on. Why did you pick this one? How did you get started? Like what did you see about this when before everybody else like most people doing something interesting sort of saw it earlier before it was consensus. Yeah. Like how did how did you get here and why this? How would you answer that question? I was an AI nerd my whole life. I came to college to study AI. I worked in the AI lab. Uh, I was like a I watched sci-fi shows growing up and I always thought it would be really cool if someday somebody built it. I thought it would be like the most important thing ever. I never thought I was going to be one to actually work on it and I feel like unbelievably lucky and happy and privileged that I get to do this. I like feel like I've like come a long way from my childhood. But there was never a question in my mind that this would not be the most exciting interesting thing. I just didn't think it was going to be possible. Uh, and when I went to college, it really seemed like we were very far from it. And then in 2012, the Alex Net paper came out done, you know, in partnership with my co-founder, Ilia. And for the first time, it seemed to me like there was an approach that might work. And then I kept watching for the next couple of years as scaled up, scaled up, got better, better. And I remember having this thing of like why is the world not paying attention to this? It seems like obvious to me that this might work. Still a low chance, but it might work. And if it does work, it's just the most important thing. So like this is what I want to do. And then like unbelievably it started to work. Thank you so much for your time. Thank you very much."
