with this if she's really hot like this kind of behavior you can totally get through life as a hot woman and be super successful with that kind of behavior havior but you got to be really hot to pull off that attitude I think we need like a like a really hot Avatar how yeah very hot how long before we have an actual sex robot that can talk to you like that uh probably not long not that long right no I mean less than five years probably really yeah will it be warm uh probably have whatever you want you can have a CAC go if you want yeah you probably could right probably a furry um yeah you could have a furry lady that you have sex with yeah like an avatar lady maybe a big giant blue lady that lives in your house yeah you know whoa whoa with the tail yeah the whole tail you lock tails you got to get your out with their tails or something yeah yeah they they link up they share souls okay something like that you know people got you remember Avatar Depression was like a legitimate psychological or the no after Avatar people got depressed cuz they wanted to live on that [ __ ] planet with those blue people and live free they live pure yeah I didn't hear about this yeah Avatar depression it was like a real thing people were talking to their therapist so much about being depressed mode too we try that what's that depressed mode no don't do it that I think there is yeah we've got like um we've got unlicensed therapist as a when we were talking um when we ran into each other at the church at the inauguration you were telling me that this is getting better and better so quickly that it's astonishing hey ARA hey Alon how's it going today good can you tell me about Avatar depression like if you see the movie Avatar but you can't live there so you get sad that's an interesting concept have you ever experienced feeling so connected to a place or community that the thought of leaving made you feel deeply sad so is this the depressed voice this is the therapist oh this is a therapist what are some ways you think you could cope with that kind of sadness if it happened to you I don't have that kind of sadness honestly I you I thought the movie would had some good special effects but I did not want to live on the planet this is just coming from a guy who wants to go to Mars yeah yeah um oh speaking of Mars what do you think about that crazy square that structure I guess there are sort of squarish things on Earth you know planet's a big place so yeah but that one eventually it's going to be pretty Square no it's it's alien civilizations of course that's what I think yeah yeah I mean what is it sorry course if you if an alien civilization did exist though and it you know what happened got hit by an asteroid whatever fting thought oh she won want ask she's like the hot lady at the party that interrupts the conversation so if if that was the case like that thing that's pretty shocking like especially ancient ruins you look at like what it looks like when they they highlight the actual structure of it it looks like ancient ruins and if you had ruins of something made of stone and it got hit by an asteroid millions and millions and millions of years ago who knows what it would look like right now that just looks oddly created looks oddly manufactured well i' probably well maybe we should go there and check it out yeah and see what it's like is there um ways that we can get better photographs it seems like that's a pretty good photograph though yeah I mean my view is we should move to Mars well not move to Mars we should have a second planet uh to preserve civilization right um because let's say hypothetically I mean maybe that maybe those are the ruins of a long dead civilization um that will probably happen to Earth at some point you know it's a matter of time before uh we get hit by an asteroid or uh maybe we do we annihilate ourselves with nuclear war or super volcanoes or super volcanoes exactly yeah there's a lot of things that could happen to us it's not a bad idea to hedge your PS yeah yeah uh genetically engineered super virus yeah this episode is brought to you by LifeLock tax season is already stressful you shouldn't have to worry about identity theft on top of everything else and trust me it's a big worry especially since during tax season your sensitive info does a lot of traveling to places you can't control it goes through payroll your accountant or your tax consultant and countless other data centers on its way to the IRS any of them can expose you to identity theft because they all have the info on your W2 just the ticket for criminals to steal your identity it's no wonder last year the IRS reported tax fraud due to identity theft went up 20% you need LifeLock they monitor millions of data points per second and alert you to threats you could miss if your identity is stolen LIF loocks us-based restoration specialist will fix it back by the million dooll protection

call 1 800 LifeLock and use the promo code Joe Rogan or or go to lifelock.com Joo Rogan for 40% off terms apply they keep doing it yeah that's what's crazy they're going yeah they didn't shut them down no the Wuhan lab was they were just talking about one that has a 30% fatality rate that they're working on yeah uh why are we doing that yeah for what reason you did it for so many years and you didn't have a cure what could possibly go wrong also wouldn't be the reason to do that so you could develop a cure at the same time and clearly you didn't have a cure so this is really foolish and bizarre yeah um I think we should stop stop trying to genetically engineer super viruses it's insane I mean when you're going through all this USA stuff yeah like here's what's weird first of all what is it like to buy a company for $44 billion and then people call you a Nazi on that same thing that you bought I did not see it coming it's like it's classic people will gobl anything down yeah oh he's never going to stop wa wait what um what is it like like all the people used to the left was in love with you and now the same idiots are calling you a Nazi it's the most bizarre thing I've ever seen in my life um I mean there's so many examples of people saying my heart goes out to you you did it with a little enthusiasm that probably wouldn't be recommended with hindsight yes but there's obviously um me in the most positive spirit possible yes obviously obvious but it's so strange where people want to think that you are openly public publicly doing Secret Nazi sey hand motions and now I can never point at things diagonally I can only point at things there and there and then I say you have to divide that yeah because that's where the spaceship is over there it's ridiculous it's ridiculous when um CNN when I was in all my trouble absur every time CNN used a photo of me it was one of the photos from the UFC weigh-ins where I go like this welcome to the weigh-ins so every photo was me every photo was me with it's it's so crazy it's delate propaganda so they they they know it was not it was obviously not meant uh it in a negative way that it was that I literally said my heart goes out to you and it was very positive the entire speech was incre very positive uh I was being very enthusiastic about the future in space um and the you know um the the was a great crowd you know so he got a little pumped up yeah it got pumped up exactly yeah that's all it is obviously obviously obviously there's video of Tim wals doing the exact same thing doing the exact same thing right exact same thing and he said of course it's a Nazi salute he said that right right this is how crazy things have gotten like well it's I mean it's it's coordinated propaganda so um the you know it's yeah coordinated propaganda the I mean doesn't it seem weird that the Legacy Media all says the same thing they all say the same thing at the same time using the same phrases they they barely even they don't even bother picking up a thesaurus right so uh like right before um you know the the debate between Biden and Trump Shar everyone was saying sharp is like who says shop is attack but yeah exactly you know it's like it's not a common phrase it's definitely not to be repeated on air with multiple people simultaneously that's weird yes that's coordinated 100% 100% yes yeah like hundreds of people saying it simultaneously uh they just got their instructions yeah so I mean essentially the um you know the the Dem leadership or you know political leadership did they issue their instructions and their puppets carry it out yeah and they're just like puppets in a puppet show and that's the problem that I see with all this Doge stuff because everybody should be celebrating that we've found a way to cut out fraud and waste yeah if you pay taxes and you don't like that you have to pay so much in taxes and then you find out that there's significant fraud and waste that's been exposed you should be celebrating it this shouldn't be oh no the wrong people found this fact and now it's a bad thing yes and then there's the [ __ ] propaganda the mind [ __ ] of calling it us Aid instead of the United States agency for International Development it sounds like it's feeding hungry people where people are going to starve Elon this is horrible and then you find out actually it's like $250 million for transgender animal studies literally mutilating animals yes mutilating animals in demented uh studies yes uh that are like the like the worst thing you could possibly imagine from a horror show the Beagle one the beagle puppy one hor where they they covered their head in a basket and put fleas on their head so they eat them alive yeah and then they studied these beagles and then killed them like what do you going to learn from that that's good for anybody yeah this some some really some psychotic stuff that happens so um yeah I mean the I guess uh the the the real threat here is to the bureaucracy so um like you probably saw like you know let's say like Trump is a threat to our democracy which is ironic since he was elected with a majority of the you know popular vote um they they started saying I was a threat to democracy but if you if you just replace threat to democracy with threat to bureaucracy it makes total sense right so um I mean the reality is that our elected officials have very very little power relative to the bureaucracy until Doge so doge is a threat to the bureaucracy it's the first threat to the bureaucracy normally the bureaucracy eats revolutions for breakfast this is the first time that they're not that the revolution might actually succeed that we could restore power to the people instead of power to the bureaucracy now the size of it yeah was when you guys first started investigating it when you first get in how much of it was shocking like this just the size of it all well the size of it all the small decisions result in multi-billion dollar outcomes uh so you know we'd see there was a case where we saw uh one person was getting $1.9 billion was sent to their NGO which basically got formed about a year ago and had no prior uh really no prior activity so they just stand up a you know an NGO the these the whole NGO thing is a is a nightmare um and it's it's a misnomer because if you have a govern funded non-governmental organization you're you're simply a govern funded organization it it it's a it's an oxymoron right it's a loophole yes it it basically the un funded NOS are a way to do things uh that would be illegal if they were the government but are somehow made legal if it's sent to a so-called nonprofit but these but these nonprofits are then used to people Cash Out These nonprofits they become very wealthy through nonprofits they pay themselves enormous sums through these nonprofits that's it's so insane that that's been going on for so long it's a gigantic scam like one of the biggest maybe the biggest scam ever and how many NOS uh I think there a total number of ngos probably Millions but uh in terms of large NOS tens of thousands uh I mean it's it's actually it's it's it's kind of a a hack to the system where you know someone can get an NGO stood up for for a fairly small amount of money like George sorus was really good at this like he really George sorus is like a assist hacker like he figured out how to hack the system he's a genius at Arbitrage um I mean these days he's he's pretty old but a genius at Arbitrage so he he figured out that you could leverage a small amount of money to create a nonprofit uh then Lobby the the politicians to send a ton of money to that nonprofit so you can take what might be you know uh a $10 million donation to a nonprofit to create a nonprofit and leverage that into a billion dollar non NGO nonprofit is a weird word it's just a non-governmental organization um and and then you can the government continues to fund that every year um and it'll have a nice sounding name like the institute for peace or something like that um but really it's a graft machine and what are their requirements with that money what do they have to do just really no requirements at all so they just get grants and the government just assumes that they're doing good work I think a lot of people in the government know that they are not doing good work uh but they it's a giant graft machine um I mean people online are like unpacking this you know um it almost seems fake like when you're seeing how we were we were covering this article that said 55,000 Democrat NOS were discovered that had been contributing to campaigns and moving things around and doing pushing propaganda and they were all connected they found it AI that you have to go through steps and steps and steps to figure out where the money's coming from oh it's all funneling down to this group and this group does that yeah it's a a giant propaganda machine a giant regime change machine yes yeah uh yes I mean but doesn't it does it do some good as well know it does some good so it's like there's it's not like 0% good uh if it was it's if it was like if it was really 0% good it be much easier to attack so they there's going to be some percent good that they they add in there but it's like it might be 5% or 10% good but 90 95% not so is there a way to audit all this stuff and find out oh these people are actually just sending food to poor people these people are actually just helping people with water in third world countries is there's a way to do that and keep funding those uh yeah I mean we we have continued to fund things that appear to be legitimate even with the flimsiest if if there's even the flimsiest excuse like I just say like send me a picture of the thing like you could literally have ai generate the picture but if you're not even willing to try to trick me then we're like not going to send the money okay so what restrictions were put on was there was some uh something set aside like medicine and there there's what was what was set aside that there was there like work for like Ebola prevention I I actually don't just know if this work is even effective uh it may may not be like it could be the kind of thing where you you sort of fund Ebola prevention but it turns out that actually you're funding a lab that develops new Ebola vir you know recipes or something you know yeah uh and they they claim it's Ebola prevention but it's actually Ebola creation so some of these things I I don't know I mean just um but it just seems like we you know we shouldn't be sending taxpayer money to dubious Enterprises overseas right yeah yeah and why are we doing it like what exactly is the reason is it because we want to make friends with these people so the Chinese don't take over the Russians don't take over okay how much of that is like a good thing how much of that is smart to do and how much is a grift and without any sort of oversight which has really been going on for so long they've just had Free Run yeah well it also we just have a real issue with the the the budget deficit it's gigantic so um like if you know all things being equal if if we didn't have a gigantic budget deficit uh where interest payments uh the interest on the national debt exceeds the defense department budget uh which is truly astounding which mean so we're paying over a trillion dollars of interest on the national debt um then okay would have more room for wasting money basically um but when uh when we're spending so much money that the company that the country is going bankrupt uh then we really need to stop stop spending money if uh unless we're sure it is good value so essentially we're like a poorly managed business with an unlimited credit line that is off the rails absolutely and if you were a person like you are who comes in and takes over businesses and straightens them out that's exactly what you're doing I mean most of the time I create businesses from scratch like Twitter was a case where you know I kind of bought a company that was I kind of knew it was a hair bow well you came in Tesla in the beginning but they were already doing something right no Tesla did Tesla did not exist in any meaningful form that it was there were no employees uh JV St and out joined three other people there was no car there was no nothing so wasn't even a prototype yet no oh okay I thought there was a prototype already no there weren't even any employees oh wasn't a f that's a funny narrative that people like to say that you didn't even create Tesla then yeah that's [Laughter] wrong so if you're handling the Govern government like a business you're going to have to go through all of these departments and do the exact same thing that you're doing with USA so how do how do you how does that scale up like how many people do you need to do something like that well we started off with about 40 people u i maybe 100 people um and really just going through doing very basic things here uh it's uh as bad as Twitter was the federal government is much worse so um you know in the case of Twitter it wasn't a profitable company it was like basically a break even company but at least it was break even and it had to pass an audit the the federal government is not break even uh it's literally losing $2 trillion a year um and it does not pass its audits it fails its own audits so like you know there's a case where um like I think Senator Collins was telling me about how she she gave the Navy $12 billion for more submarines got no extra submarines um and then held a hearing to say where' the1 12 billion go and they were like we don't know that was it uh I mean the basically stuff is so crazy it's like only the federal government could get away with this level of waste of of waste it's mostly waste it's mostly not for it's mostly waste it's it's mostly just ridiculous things happening um because they've been able to do it this way for so long and they' become accustomed to it yeah I mean it's like Milton Friedman said like money is most poorly spent when when you're spending someone else's money on people you don't know how much are you going to care right and that's the that's the federal government so they they're spending someone else's money on people they don't know now imagine any other business that was this badly run that complains when you want to check the books and audit it and go through all the decisions that have been made and go through all the ledgers and like yeah what did you do well the people receiving the money uh want to keep receiving the money yeah yeah yeah clearly yes so but you know I mean the reason I'm the reason I'm uh putting so much effort into this is that I think it is a very dire situation it's not a you know um it's not optional basically so um yeah yeah America's going bankrupt so that that that just can't happen it's just bizarre to me that that some people aren't willing to look at it correctly they they're not willing to see like how much chaos this is how much waste and fraud there is how much how much could be trimmed and how just because people have jobs doing [ __ ] doesn't mean your tax dollar should pay for this [ __ ] yes um I mean we found just with a a basic sear of the Social Security database that there were um 20 million dead people mocked as alive but were they getting money some of them are getting money what percentage of them uh it isn't clear we're actually trying to run the I was trying to get an answer right before the show um what it looks like is that most of the fraud is not coming from Social Security payments directly but because they are marked as alive in the Social Security database that they can get then get disability Unemployment uh sort of fake medical payments and other things because they're marked as alive uh in the Social Security database so it looks like it's a bank the the the fraud is a bankshot essentially the they bankshot uh into uh Social Security uh they just do an areu alive check and then uh get fraudulent payments from every other part of the government oh yeah and and this exploits the the the fundamental weakness in the government is that the various govern databases they don't talk to each other or they they talk to each other very poorly in a very limited way so the way to the way that the system gets exploited is is by taking advantage of the the the poor communication between the various databases in the government um to give you an example of like what's happening in sayate uh treasury which is improving rapidly um the the main uh payments computer is called Pam uh like payments account payment accounts Master database or something like that but everyone calls a Pam um that's responsible for almost $5 trillion payments a year roughly a billion dollar an hour and um when we came there we're looking at this payment it's like the the payments have no uh you could put a payment through with with no payment categorization code and and no description on the payment like basically untraceable blank checks um this is the kind of thing that if if it was done as a public company uh the company would uh be immediately delisted and the uh executive team would be thrown in prison but this is just normal at the government so we said okay our recommendation to the treasury and the Federal Reserve was like we need to make the the payment categorization codes mandatory not optional and you need there needs to be an ex an an explanation we're not judging the quality of the explanation but there should be some explanation for what this payment is for above nothing that's a radical change to the system that is being implemented now um I my guess is that probably saves a 100 billion a year Jesus Christ that money going rough rough order magnitude where was that money going well so this is where you get into the the sort of gray boundary between waste and fraud um if money is sent to a person or or organization from the government um and you didn't really deserve it but the government still sent it to you is that waste or fraud right um so I mean there's a lot of payments that where someone just appr approved the payment but then that payment officer uh changed jobs or retired or died um and the payments just keep going you know it's like if you forget to pay your gym membership or something like that right now imagine it's not the gym membership you said your gym membership's $20 billion a year or something you know um but they forgot to turn it off there like that happening at scale in the government Jesus it's totally nuts is what I'm saying so insane yes it's totally insane so what did you expect when you went in did you expect it would be like this I thought it's I thought it would be it would be bad but I did not think it would be as bad as this um I mean look the the good news is that uh it's a target-rich environment for saving money uh it's not like uh you it's not like if it it was a very well-run ship uh it was very efficient it would be hard to improve but it's not efficient so therefore it is actually relatively easy to improve let's just say it's not rocket science you know I know rocket science so it's a lot of uh mundane things um so and some of the some of the things are like so crazy that we didn't even know to ask about that because we just assumed umed like you know payments out of the treasury computer would have a payment categorization code and they would have some explanatory note saying what the payments for the idea that that it would be just untraceable blank checks uh didn't occur to us at first Jesus so

a c I think that's probably a cumulative number um yes so yeah but yeah if you if you add up it's do you remember that story Jamie yeah what was the story almost what she said there like they just didn't have accounting for it I think yeah it was spent on legitimate things worry but we don't we don't know what we spent it on well I mean how do you know obviously one cannot say it's was spent legitimately if they don't know what it was spent on that doesn't make any sense this is this is such a fascinating time because with this setup the way it is right now with Trump back in after all that happened to him and with you there and with RFK Junior and Tulsi and cash Patel it's like this is a wild time to find out what really going on that's like never happened before this is nothing like the first term no like the first term he had a bunch of neocons in the cabinet and there's a bunch of shady people that he didn't know and he had to appoint all these different people maybe he got some bad picks now he's had four years to Stew on it right and with you guys all going through this we're getting an understanding of the government that we've literally never had before yeah this is a revolutionary cabinet and maybe the most re tionary cabinet since the the first Revolution uh this is this is not a bunch of business as usual uh types so this is why you know some of the the standard confirmations were quite challenging is because when you when you put to try to appoint people who are going to change the system yeah uh the system doesn't want to let them through but it's fascinating because it's like the vampires all out themselves like now everybody knows who the system is like if you're just lying about us and then they come and you talk on aast and expain what's like he's starving mothers there's mothers that can't get food totally false that's all you're hearing yeah that's that's no one's talking in any of these mainstream liberal talk shows no one is talking about all this fraud and waste yeah because we're cutting off their graph machine so that that's what they're upset about that's that's the real thing they're upset about U and if if if people want to know what uh do is cutting and and I want to be clear like these are cuts that Doge recommends to the department and usually these recommendations are followed but uh these are recommendations that are then confirmed by the department um the uh you can see line by line what do is done at Doge Dogo so what if we do we put on do. goov so you can see everything that is being done and there's a Tracker that shows is it how much money has been saved yeah yeah and you can look at each line item and and you know they like a bunch of these sort of sort of far left uh shows will will say like oh it's a constitutional crisis blah blah blah but what they won't do is point out which payments are wrong right so my challenge to them is point out which payments are wrong yeah go through it which which of which of these sort of waste fraud things are wrong which line explain that line to the public they won't be able to right yeah that's why you're not hearing any specifics you're hearing an stories about mothers we can name the specifics yeah line by line and we got the receipts and here's the other thing if you're post the receipts and if you're only talking about the propaganda talking points and you're not talking about the very clear fraud and waste it's very obvious what you're doing yeah you're just gaslighting yeah yeah totally yeah so exactly because we're say like look in fact I've said we're going to make mistakes we're not going to be perfect uh so if we make a mistake we'll quickly fix it so we'll we'll we'll you we need to act fast uh so stop wasting billions of dollars of taxpayer money um but if if we make a mistake we'll reverse it quickly right you know so it's also this interesting narrative that you shouldn't have access to this social security information as if no one's had access to it before as if the Biden Administration in 2023 had there was like 53 people some of them were students that had access to all this stuff yeah uh as it is there are uh tens of thousands of of federal employees that have access already to the system uh anyone from Doge has to go through the same vetting process that those those federal employees went through so there's not like some unvetted random situation if for example there's a security clearance needed uh the Doge person has to have that same security clearance so there's no um reduction in security um but I mean obviously the the the vast numbers of social security numbers have leaked onto the internet people have hacked the the government systems multiple times uh vast amounts of public information has been hacked and and uh DED on to the Internet so I me there's a guy at the IRS that leaked a half a million tax returns just a few years ago on purpose yeah for what reason uh I for politic he he he he wanted to I think he was trying to get a trump and maybe me and a few others um so but he he he he stole like 500,000 uh tax returns like not a few like it's a lot of tax Jesus Christ yeah oh I remember that story now remember you just you just read about it online it's not it's a real thing so these are the narratives that's the narrative that you shouldn't have access to social security the the other narrative is that starving people are going to die and women aren't going to be pregnant and not have nutrients for their babies and that's that's all you're hearing and um yeah well that's the that's the that's the only thing they they can say but they can point to the line item right um and so they can't say like well this is the thing where you know the nutrients for pregnant mothers were stopped this they can't point to that because we didn't right is a lie what's fascinating to me is um how much the mainstream media is in line with the very specific talking points and how little you you have Fox News you essentially have Fox News on television it's like the only one that is pointing out the ridiculous fraud and waste and yeah you know I know you saw the Jeff Bezos thing in the Washington Post they're going to stop all the wacky editorials and and limit that stuff to uh I think it was uh wealth and personal freedom or something along those lines yeah yeah so I mean I think it's this kind of I think it makes sense uh because he's just talking about the things not not the the sort of just talking about the opinions opinion pieces the opinion pieces yeah yeah so the regular journalism stays the same well it's a detriment to their business I mean you're seeing over and over again people that just they don't want to hear all this [ __ ] from these people anymore it's like you're you're you're saying it's almost like you're caught in an outdated version of the virus and everybody else already has the immunity to that virus like this is yeah you know like you need you need a new mind virus the one that you're pushing it's like it doesn't work anymore it's too crazy yeah uh it's the whole thing is very crazy um I mean the media is incredibly partisan I mean they're not uh I they take almost all the media is um you left shifted yeah so it's like it's kind of weird if you talk to somebody who gets all their information from like what I call Legacy Media uh they're living in a different world yeah uh than if they say are listening to you know U your podcast or um are getting new news from from X or you know just if it's it's like it's it's kind of wild like it is very wild like you talk it's it's like they're living in an Ultimate Reality oh there's a lot of people that I talked to to that I have to go where did you hear that yeah yeah uh but I mean like the Associated Press which I call Associated propaganda the AP um you know they they ran a a international news story saying that we that Doge fired air traffic controllers but we didn't fire any air traffic controllers at all in fact we're trying to hire air traffic controllers not fire them yeah I saw that you you made a tweet about it right yeah what do you call it now do you call it a post post yeah whatever you can't call it a tweet though do you call it a tweet accidentally I don't know listen uh but like if you if if one like let's say somebody post if somebody puts up like an you know two hour long video that's not a tweet right it's a post it's a PO yeah good point yeah yeah for sure yeah so um but I hot over if people still want to call it a tweet whatever you put a post about it just to get back to it saying that if you we need highly qualified air traffic controllers if you retired if you would consider doing it again we could use you uh yes so uh a lot of really qualified air traffic controllers were were pushed out because of Dei stuff so um I mean not to to be blunt I mean a bunch of old white a bunch of really good talented old white guys were pushed out it's not cool um and so we have there's a talent shortage in a traffic control because of Dei and and and not being not hiring people on Merit you know which is so crazy that that worked I think we we should not put the public safety at risk you know because of some demented philosophy somebody made a post today about it in infiltrating the NSA did you see any of that that was that was some gnarly stuff yeah crazy what they they they it started off as just like this sort of Fringe thing and people would meet up then it completely infiltrated the organization and they were spending all their time there like 400 people or something some like some chat sex chat room with like some extremely demented stuff yeah yeah I I know I sa it I'll send it to you Jamie because it's so cooky you you you what this is the NSA I thought the NSA was just all about like information and spy on you know like if like is a national threat or something yeah I think this is exactly it um so she uh more than 100 intelligence staffers will be fired over sexually explicit texts in NSA chat rooms Gabbert says um so so top intelligence official told Waters that the workers in question were Brazen and using an NSA platform intended for professional use to conduct this kind of really really horrific Behavior Uh what is the behavior what exactly what is it do they say in this article uh yeah I think they were also okay it says employees who participate in the n's obscene pornographic and sexually explicit chat rooms your tax dollars at work well it was all like de I it was all like LBGTQ stuff it was there was a lot of like transition stuff and yeah I I know I definitely saved it but point is um it had infiltrated the organization it's not what they should be talking about at all at all at all supposed to be protecting the country right and if you and people were talking about how they're sping half their time in these meetings and that they're just like constantly having to attend these things where they talk about these issues like what are what are you doing like if you have a problem with someone that's discriminatory get rid of that person that's it yes it's you problem's over you got someone who's homophobic in your business they're openly homophobic yeah that you can't work here that's not cool that's it that's it you don't have to have [ __ ] meetings constantly promoting this you're not going to change someone's opinion by berating them over and over again yeah I mean a work environment should be a professional environment where you know they're they're they're getting the job done that they're you know you know being paid to do uh that it should be obviously not supposed to be sort of getting paid for bizarre SE sexcapades it's just so fascinating that the virus was so strong that it made it into the NSA yes and was you would think those are some hard the CIA too the CIA was in there too yeah they were in there too which is bananas you would think same thing like hard-nosed like tough people doing hard work who can spy on you whenever they want yeah yeah and get revenge on you whenever they want yeah pretty wild yeah and you know they exist when the president leaves they stay people move around you stay a part of the organization for your entire career you get deeply entrenched in their system and how things work and who's back to rub and who's who's a bad guy who's a good guy who's on our side who's not yeah it's scary actually yeah um so was that what's taken so long with this Epstein files yeah what's up with that what is up with that it was like yeah it's it's like Lucy and the football with Charlie Brown when she always pulls that football away it's the same thing it's like they keep telling us they're going to release it day one oh day one we have a serious case of no one's being arrested O phobia you know well there's also right like what the [ __ ] is going on what the [ __ ] is going on also there's this real fear that someone's destroying the evidence and you keep hearing these stories unsubstantiated stories yeah of you know FBI people where the evidence I mean the guy had like tons of videos and uh recordings yeah I mean he had all sorts of things right like there's a mountain of evidence right so where's that mountain yeah where where is that mountain and what would be the reason why they would agree like there would have to be something in it for them to agree to not put it out right like there has to be some sort of financial entanglement some sort of relationship with the people that are on that list yeah that they can provide a value that was big enough for you to not release it or to slow relase it or to hope you can get away with like putting out some redacted files that don't show anything this is only red redacted redacted only stage one don't worry the real stuff's coming like that doesn't make any sense like why wouldn't you just release it all like what what could possibly be well worth protecting in there I mean I think I've got probably the same information that I mean I'm just reading what's what's the latest thing on the X you know I'm just looking at my X feed and I'm like yeah you know it's a real page Turner um and like I thought we were going to get some re Revelations to it was like big binders full of stuff there's got to be something in there well there was in all those people that were given a copy of it they were all like waving around they got the Willy Wonka ticket yeah yeah totally yeah and what happened nothing nothing so I think Laura lomer released it online I think I'm watching TW yeah she's not very pleased about this so does anybody find anything in there that's interesting no it's all old stuff from 2015 and okay what the [ __ ] is going on but but then apparently this they discovered a whole bunch of stuff at the southern dist District of New York right so that's and and and I'm like and I me I think you know Pam Bondi is actually great and cash Patel are great but they're like they just got there you know right so then they're they're in not they're they just got there but they're they're in a hostile environment they're not in a friendly environment right um so um you know it's like if you suddenly got put in captain of a ship but the crew was previously your enemy right the entire crew was previously your enemy right you know and you're telling them give me evidence yeah the crew doesn't want to give you the evidence you enemy they were like your mortal enemies just a moment ago you just got there yeah so yeah I think we got to give um you know um the attorney general and you know new director of the FBI some a little bit of slack here because they literally just got there I think so too but hey don't say you're going to release it on day one then yeah you shouldn't have said that sure and don't say you got a big drop coming tomorrow and that's some [ __ ] that's been around forever it's disappointing yeah what the and where's the JFK files where are those yeah let them go did they release anything on that front I don't know what's going on it can't be anything that's gotten to me yet so if nothing's gotten to me yet it can't be signicant if there's conspiracy evidence someone's going to send it yes Tim Dylan's going to text me 100% Tim Dylan Dave Smith someone's going to send my way theu yeah so it has it hasn't been released yet yeah you would find out and here's the real question like what could even be in there at this point that they haven't cleared out if you've got paperwork from 1963 like what is in there still what is in there that could possibly be incriminating that supposedly Trump said that if you saw what they showed me you wouldn't release it either okay what the [ __ ] does that I haven't seen it so Cashel has yes he said he seen it all yeah um can he just post it to his like X account or something I mean I just we that sounds like an Elon move I don't think he can he's the director of the FBI I think he has to go through proper channels and does he he has the channel I yeah but there's rules he sounds like Trump he sound like Trump he needs an executive order what about the storm I am the storm I mean what channels he is the channel well again imagine just getting to the the hull or just getting to the uh deck of the ship and you're the captain yeah and now you uh you have to figure out who's running things who's doing this where is everything yeah um yeah just getting getting anything done like just like said you're you just joined as Captain of a ship of where the crew hates your guts yeah they were your enemy yeah they were your enemy they're strongly opposed to anything you want to do yeah um and you're trying to give them orders and you're trying to expose them yeah they don't want to be exposed right you're you're literally people that are working there probably a part of this problem I mean I I was reading onx that like comey's daughter is like the lead prosecutor in southern district of New York did you read that yes and and like so obviously there's a bit of an entanglement there a little bit like what if there's something that uh you know makes puts her dad in a bad light exactly she a [ __ ] Shredder hit that delete button you know did you see uh General Flynn he was on a podcast and he he spoke directly to James Comey yeah he said Jim you're going to jail and unless you give up someone deeper than you and you know who that is you know who I'm talking about like that is wild yeah um I think that the former director of the FBI might be really in that kind of deep [ __ ] and he really actually was doing some evil corrupt [ __ ] while he run in the FBI I mean it seems like there's some very shady stuff that's been going on um it seems like it definitely happened in the' 60s right everybody kind of admits to that they admit the FBI uh killed black panthers they they did they did a lot of [ __ ] there's a lot of stuff that went on that we know the government did way back in the day yeah why don't we just data dump the files just like go in there take photos of of all the papers presumably paper um and just post it online and and uh let let the CHS fall where they may is it presumably everyone like some like filing cabinet somewhere I don't know right where is it where's where's the magic filing cabinet how are they hiding it who's got access to it like this this is what I was hoping day one I was hoping but obviously it's taking a lot longer than that so I I think part of it is like you know like let's let's say let's say you were made direct to the FBI okay I might be able to that's what crazy literally you know what's he doing now he's he's one of the big dogs of theba but he Secret Service guy yeah legit guy but people think of him as a Fox News guy just like Pete heg same thing they don't want to think about his distinguished military career they want to say oh that Fox News guy director deputy director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation I mean Dan's hardcore I me if he if it's if it's reasonably findable I think he's going to find it this is between him and cash I mean like I think they're going to get stuff how crazy would it be if they couldn't though how crazy would it be if they can't find anything if it's that if if everybody shuts their mouth and everybody covers their ass like an FBI computer where you type in the search that's I I just like the basic mechanism here like it's either in a filing cabinet in in paper where it's like you know maybe there's like Progressive levels of security you know you're like open this door oh you got to have do you have the pass for this level you like level unlocked and there's a level unlocked and it's like get there laptop yeah yeah there's laptop you gotta only plug it in it's in a skiff yeah this is why like I think I think like tour of four KNX would be awesome like a live tour of Fort Knox we can actually see it's like is the C there or not they say it is is it real or did somebody spray paint some lead you know imagine if it's not imagine if it's not all there like some of it's missing where to go what if a lot of it's missing what if like half of it's missing I mean who how do we even know I don't know they said the last time they let someone look at it was decades ago yeah well the last I believe the last formal audit was in the 50s so I'm like okay oh my just think about all the other maybe yeah think about all the other stuff that you pointed out all the the the checks that just go out the the NGO payments the Social Security people think about all just all that now apply that to the gold absolutely I just want to like emphasize the sure Madness of the the government it's it's just because they have like m the Magic Money computers that that they the checks all the checks never bounce for the federal government like so you don't have the the normal corrective mechanism that you'd have for a company or for an individual the checks just always always always clear the net result is inflation which is effectively a tax on everyone um but uh you know like the defense Pro hasn't passed an audit in I don't know how many years seven years yeah I mean exactly so it's like You' have to be freaking Chuck Norris to like only Chuck Norris could get the defense department to pass an order you know typee of thing that's the level of skill you need you know um well that's what's so insane if you bring it back to the idea that it's a business well yeah this would never be tolerated in any kind of functional business exactly so U you know um you know Pentagon will will like like their accounting error like the stuff that that they lose in the couch cushions is like 20 30 B billion dollars a year they don't know don't know where it went it's gone where it go and it's gone it's so insane it's insane it's so insane so that's why I said like even simple things like just requiring that the that outgoing payments for the treasury computer have a payment code and a comment of what the payment is about and someone to call about the payment um I think will have an very powerful effect in stopping wasteful outflows and stopping fraud yeah and and here's another way to look at this imagine if some there are people like you and the Doge team out there in the world imagine if one of those works for an organization like us a or any other organization and has this understanding of how much fuckeries involved but they have evil intentions and they're entwined in this system for decades and decades and they've built a career and all the entanglements that come and they start moving [ __ ] around you could probably do it easy it sounds like the way you've laid it out if you were a career person who's in there forever who knew how everything works Y and you were very clever you could make some [ __ ] happen and you could probably do it in conjunction with some people that you know that are forming an NGO hey let's all work together yeah yeah and this is the resistance that you're facing yeah the I think it's the biggest scam of all time this is not something you ever saw the biggest scam of all time ever of human history of human history yes wow I think you're right yeah I how what else probably a trillion dollar scam there's never been a trillion dollar scam you know now this is not something that you ever set out to do this is not you didn't have this as a career aspiration this is not like this is the most absurd outcome I can possibly imagine actually also like Doge started as like a sort of a a meme coin right you know it was like a a joke cryptocurrency involving memes and dogs mhm um and uh which is so funny that the letters wind up being perfect yeah well actually I was originally going a quote like the government efficiency commission which is very boring name um and then people online were no it needs to be the department of government efficiency uh and I was like you know what you're right of course of course of course I mean it's more evidence of the simulation that that little like a mascot is a is a cute dog it's a meme coin the meme coin is probably worth a lot of money right now right like every time you tweet about it probably I don't know shoots up yeah the the mem the whole meme coin thing is bananas yeah it is so bananas that people dump real money into these coins and then you could just pump them up and sell them a casino or something I don't know yeah it's totally G people just do whatever the greater fo and musical chairs and whoever's like the last to sit down lose type of thing and somehow or another it's still legal like that's that's think not I think not too many people I mean I mean it's sort of like you go to the casino like you if you expect to win at the casino you're being a fool okay so I think if you expect to win at meme coins you're being it's not you're being foolish yeah yeah you're not gonna win a meme coins it's like it's it's but if if if you want like don't sink your life savings into a meme coin no but you can gamble a little and you can ride waves and win a little and lose a little if if you want to have some fun and and don't come then you know play have play with me and coins but if you put your if you put your on a m coin in the at the RIS of saying something bold and outrageous don't bet the F on a mcoin the weird one is the pump and dumps like people all time all the time and people get shocked that somebody pump and dumped like what is what are you doing did you like I was hoping to dump I was hoping to make all the money out of this I can't believe they got me like yeah it's just weird that it's legal still uh I mean casinos IL legal and and people just lose money at casinos you know but you can't rig a casino like a pump and dump you could rig a pump and dump you know uh yeah I guess so um like you could run a real pyramid scheme well I mean the government's one a big pyramid scheme if you ask me yeah well you you can tell Social Security is is the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time right explain that oh so um well people pay into Social Security um and and the money goes out of Social Security immediately but the obligation for Social Security is uh your entire retirement career so you're you're paying uh with your the you're paying like like if you look at the future obligations of Social Security it far exceeds uh the tax revenue far have you ever looked at the the the debt The Debt Clock yes okay there's there's there's our present day debt but then there's our future obligations so when you look at the future obligations of Social Security um the actual uh national debt is like double what what people think it is because of the future obligations ah so basically people are living way longer than expected um and uh there are fewer babies being born so you have more people who are retired and get that that live for a long time and get retirement payments so the future obligations so H how bad the financial situation is right now for the federal government it will be much worse in the future at the risk of being a buzz kill here did you see so we better fix what we got right now because if it's bad now it's going to be much worse in the future there was an interview with this woman who was a whistleblower did we ever find out if that was true there's so many whistles being blown it's hard to keep track a lot of whistles this one lady it was only in one state it was very specific instance believe right but it was using Social Security money correct that was her that was her allegation so what what she was alleging was that she was in charge of turning uh illegal immigrants into clients that's what they would call them and that she would go to them and try to ask them do you have a headache do you have back problems if you do now you can be permanently disabled you get permanent disability so you get Social Security for Life yes yeah no not just Social Security but disability which is even more right and you get them for on the taxpayer Dole right away the m and they're illegal aliens yes oh so if I were to say like what's at the heart of the sort of like why is a Democrat propaganda machine so fired up to destroy me that's the main reason the main reason is that uh is that um uh entitlements fraud that includes like Social Security Disability Medicaid uh entitlements fraud for illegal aliens is what is serving as a gigantic magnetic force to pull people in from all around the world and keep them here like basically if you if you pay people uh at a standard of living that is above 90% of Earth then you have a very powerful uh incentive for 90% of Earth to come here and to stay here but if you if you end the illegal alien fraud then you that you turn off that magnet and they leave and they they stop coming and and the ones that are here many of them will simply leave and if if that happens a massive they will lose a massive number of democratic voters and if it didn't happen they would turn those people into voters correct which they were trying to do they are already turning them so in in New York state illegal aliens can already vote in state and city elections a lot of people don't don't know that there there's I mean they're trying to fight that in they're trying to stop that but it's there currently I think it's like 600,000 uh are Reg said to vote illegal aliens in New York that is wild yeah well well I mean if you look at say um you know FEMA like the the agency that was paying for illegal aliens to stay at luxury hotels in New York was FEMA the F you know that's meant that that's an agency that's meant to support Americans in distress from natural disasters was paying for luxury hotels for illegals in New York it's true yeah that's a fact fact they're literally like when we stuff that payment we we stopped all those those money because that's obviously an insane way to spend taxpayer money um the uh New York uh sued the government Su the federal government to get the money so you can just look at their lawsuit they they were give they were sending that money even after president Trump signed an executive order saying it needs to to stop they still press sand on $80 million to luxury hotels in New York your tax money went to pay for illegal aliens in luxury hotels in New York from an agency that is meant to help Americans in distress from natural disasters right and I would like to know how much and I would like to know how much they spent on North Carolina and how much they spent on Maui yes exactly uh what What's actually happened is they're buying voters that's really what's happening it's like it's like a giant voter for scam they're importing voters and uh and it's really just a matter of time so like a lot of people have trouble believing this but if you the more you look at it the more you will realize just how much of a problem this is and how it's it's it's not just real it is it is an attempt to destroy Democracy in America that's what in my view it is what it really is like if you take the the the sort of seven swing States like often the imin of Victory there is like maybe 20,000 votes if you put 200,000 um illegals in there and they have like a 80% likelihood of voting them uh and it's only a matter of time before they become citizens then those swing States will not be swing states in the future and if they are not swing States we will be a permanent one party State country permanent uh deep blue socialist State that's what America will become and that was the game plan that that was that was the game plan that is still the game plan and they almost succeeded if if if if the if the machine of which the Kam puppet was the representation had won that's what would have happened the reason I went so hardcore for for for for Trump was because to me this was a folk in the road very like a very obvious folk in the road um if they had another four years they would legalize enough illegals in the swing states to make the swing States uh not swing States they would just there would be blue States then then they would they would win the presidential they'd win the house the Senate and the presidency um they would then make uh District you know DC into a state may maybe Puerto Rico get four extra Senators pack the Supreme Court so then you'll have the house Judiciary Senate uh and presidency all blue and then they will keep importing more illegals to cement that that outcome basically what happened in California Jesus Christ it would have been the end that's why I went so hardcore for for trump it was otherwise been the end and that's why the the the Democrat machine is so intent on destroying me it's just so fascinating that people can't see this I mean I invite people to do their research the more they do their research the more they will see that what I'm saying is absolutely true D it's like just do the research yeah it's it's such a bad idea even for the Democrats which is what they don't understand like it's the same it's not ultimately going to work out no it's the same people yes it's just they're doing it under the guys that they're the kind compassionate Progressive people yes but the same outcome takes place it's just about control they they probably Institute some Central Bank digital currency and some social credit score system and censorship of course yeah of course well they that was the big Fe coming into this election was that if they can't censor things like well I we talked about it before but there's there was two major Forks in the road the big one was Trump didn't get shot y the other big one was You by Twitter and if those two things don't happen the whole world looks different yes yeah we don't want to be on that timeline no we don't want to have only one side represented because guess what they will hijack that side whatever it is they will hijack that side and use it for money and control and that's what it's all about it's not about good people versus bad people it's a [ __ ] shell game yeah I I mean I think these things are actually it's easy to understand if you look at basic incentives the the basic incentive here is the more legals that the Democrats can bring in the more likely they are to win so that's what they're going to do um that's what they have been doing uh and it worked in California California super majority Dem um and look at all the companies that are leaving California yeah um I mean in and- out just announced they're leaving their headquarters leaving California they're moving to Tennessee yeah yeah so um and and California uh made Healthcare free for illegals yeah as of last year so and and that obviously that's a gigantic magnet for more illegals like and this is not a thing you can solve simply with money because what happens is the you simply have more patients than a doctor can possibly see and you can't just you know make doctors out of nothing like the it so people like oh it's just a money thing no you it takes a long time for somebody to become a doctor you know the 30 years um and uh and so what actually happens in California is that there are too many patients for the doctors to see so then uh the average citizen in California suffers as a result um now the the elite in California are fine because they have private doctors you know they have they can they can just pay for the best doctors so the elite in California doing fine but your your average C citizen in California is not doing fine um and the the tax burden for uh healthcare for illegals was supposed to be three billion I think they now estimated it's 9 billion but that but that that number will scale to Infinity basically it's like why not like why not if you if you need any operation at all come to California and have it be free right from anywhere on earth and the people that want to look at it in the most charitable way they say oh well these people are hardworking good people and they're the backbone of our city and they should have access to all the things that we have access to and I just don't think they understand that it's a political Pawn I don't think they understand this is not done for compassion and kindness no this is just done to ensure that it stays Blue correct yeah and it's essentially a bribery with your tax dollars yes this is why um that the dams will not even um Deport criminals yeah um because every criminal deported is a lost vote so even even if if somebody is uh um illegal with a criminal record and commits crime in America they are still still were not being deported and then on top of that California made it actually illegal to ask for ID when people vote Yes California and New York uh you are not allowed to show your ID when you vote I just want to be clear so everyone understands this in California New York you are not allowed to show your ID even if you want to right why would that ever be a good idea I mean what like if you want to man if you're trying to do if you're trying to facilitate fraud in elections it's a great idea that's the only reason yes there's no other reason Lally why that would be a good idea it's for fraud it's it's like it's like wake up she wake up hello like let's say you wanted to commit for what are the things you would do yeah you would say you don't need ID and you can mail in your ballot and we'll give you free healthare yes stay here yes stay here I know it's on fire but stay here I mean in this case it being on fire is not just a metaphor in California okay it's just like godamn entire neighborhood's burning down it's just once they uh allowed people to vote that are not legal in California once you if you're if you're going to do that it's it's over it's exactly there's there's no coming back from that the numbers are just no people are so indoctrinated too there's so many people that no matter what they think voting Republican means you're an [ __ ] yes and they won't do it they won't do it they they'll put their [ __ ] rainbow flag on their porch and they'll just ride it right into the beach civilizational suicide yeah right to the Rocks bang crash the boat I mean uh there's there's a guy um who post X who's who great God Gods side yeah friend of mine he been on podcast punch times yeah he's awesome yeah he's great um and he talks about uh you know basically suicidal empathy mhm like if there's like there's so much empathy that you actually suicide yourself yeah um so that we've got civilizational suicidal empathy going on and it's like I believe in empathy like I think you should care about other people but you need to have empathy for for civilization as a whole and not commit to a civilizational suicide also don't let someone use your empathy against you so they can completely control your state and then do it insanely bad job of managing it and never get removed the the the fundamental weakness of Western Civilization is empathy the empathy exploit they there it's it's they're exploiting a a a bug in western civilization which is the empathy response so and I I I think you know empathy is good but you need to think it through and not just be programmed like a robot right understand when empathy has been actually used as a to a tool yes like the it's weaponized empathy yeah is the issue yeah weaponized empathy and yeah um and it's also the rigid adherence to that liberal ideology like you can't switch sides over there like California if you're a part of that whole Tech Hollywood entertainment any any of those circles you're on the left like almost wholly almost completely it's borderline illegal to be a republican in California uh I mean like in San Francisco or La it's borderline illegal to be a republican you're certainly shunned no I look I mean in like San Francisco you you you could shoot heroin while taking a dump on the mayor's car in front of City Hall okay and and that and nothing would happen to you but if you walk down the street with a Maga hat you're GNA get attacked yeah it's insane yeah it's insane it's also so orwellian that a hat that says make America great again would cause people to have a violent reaction like aren't you American wouldn't just just as a a whole like the saying wouldn't that be a good thing for everyone make America great again but because it's attached to Donald Trump and that red hat you'll get maced for wearing that red hat they will make America worse by beating you so it's like it's an evil thing they're doing a violent assault in America because you want to make America great again I mean it's like a scene in a book it doesn't it doesn't seem like it could be that ridiculous like remember when all lives matter would get you fired which is insane insane people got fired because they said all lives matter which is a very reasonable thing to say how reasonable is that yes that's essentially saying everybody matters but that's not that's Lally all you're saying that's not what you were supposed to say you had to say black lives matter which of course they do if you say all lives matter everybody matters yes but the idea of being a colorblind Society was completely abandoned somewhere around 2012-ish yeah I mean I I sort of can trace it to when when did the the the gun emoji get nerfed you know uh when did it turn into a squirt gun that was a couple of years ago that was like 2016 I think was it yeah yeah it became a squirt gun can you bring it back X yeah no no right now if if if you uh use a gun emoji on X the Apple will insist that it' be a squirt gun and then the X app turns it back into uh a 1911 oh really yeah oh that's great so you can you can actually uh you know have have a 1911 gun um we we we reverted the Apple change inside the app oh that's hilarious that's hilarious that that it's that thing's so offensive the gun and then the pregnant man both of those got me like you [ __ ] I mean I like that mem where it's like the people telling you that what you're hearing is dis information are the same people that did the pregnant man emoji yes yeah think about that yeah well also the same people that say a woman attacked a Tesla Factory yeah the woman it's a dude it's a dude like really obvious dude really big mentally ill dude yeah mentally ill dude with a wig on say that yes yeah but NBC even fo you're looking at the picture a woman yo this is got a this this is a dude with a wrong jawline okay he's wearing Woman face is a buff it's a buff dude yeah it's a buff dude wearing Woman face I mean come on that's not a that's not a woman yeah and they're like saying watch shot for disinformation I'm like what are you talking about it's so crazy this is [ __ ] I mean it's just more evidence of the virus though right like it killed objectivity killed reality and it it demanded strict adherence or you were attacked yeah yeah any questioning of it uh would result in in being ostracized do you like what what kind of responsibility do you like knowing that if you didn't take over Twitter and turn it into X if that didn't happen like the I really think the world's a very different place right now like how long have you owned it for a couple years basically imag imagine a couple years of it being run the way it was run before and probably accelerating my account would have been suspended long ago for sure yeah for sure yeah just for the disinformation yeah um it would have been Trum would have never come back Alex Jones would have definitely never been back definitely not no no um so yeah um does that weigh on you like I would feel like that would be a [ __ ] heavy responsibility yeah um I mean I'm just trying to keep civilization going here you know for longer um so um I think we at least want to build a city on Mars um and become a multiplet civilization uh which I think would be incredibly important in ensuring the long-term survival of civilization are you still rescuing those people that are stuck in the space station uh yeah that's coming up in a couple weeks I think whoa they've been up there for how long Jamie they were supposed to be there for a couple days right I think actually prob like four weeks oh they're supposed to be they were supposed to be up there for like eight days yeah and they've been up there for like I think eight months so a little longer than expected [ __ ] yeah what is it going to be like for those people when they get back they're going to be a wreck for a long time right yeah if as long you stay up there you get you know sort of in zero you get increased bone loss so um you it ended up being like this political football um and uh sort of sort of hotly contested topic um we offered to bring them back early this offer was rejected by the Biden Administration whyl for political reasons that's so crazy I there's no way that they're going to make anyone who's supporting Trump look look good wow what do you think they would have done if they had won uh well get those people back no they can they can only get them back with with a SpaceX spacecraft but they they push the return date past the uh inauguration date wow yeah so they would have let you do it but after the wow and so it would have been them authorizing you there isn't anyone else to to to do it NASA can't get them uh the only only the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft is the only one that is considered safe enough to bring them back so the NASA concluded that the Boeing spacecraft was not safe so that's why they're stuck there holy [ __ ] yeah and you can't ask Russia to help that would be awkward a little bit yeah yeah be a nice thing if they did they said guys will help you I think they for enough money they would you think so uh yeah but they would they would obviously treat it as a propaganda Victory and charge crazy money it's just disgusting that they would use that as a political tool yeah um yeah um so well they were also the Biden Administration was also suing SpaceX uh they had this massive lawsuit against SpaceX for SpaceX not hiring Asylum Seekers right so so people like say like oh El's making it up this V Administration wasn't against SpaceX I'm like bro the Department of Justice had a massive lawy law suit against SpaceX for not hiring Asylum Seekers even though it is illegal for us to hire hire anyone who is not a permanent resident so it is both there's a law that says you have to hire Asylum Seekers but there's also a law that says anyone hired by a rocket company which is an advanced weapons technology must be a permanent resident and if an asylum Seeker is not a permanent resident so it is both legal and illegal to hire Asylum Seekers so why would the vien Administration launch a massive lawsuit again this is public information it's not like my imagination um why would they launch do such a massive lawsuit against SpaceX they're extremely antagonistic it just doesn't make any sense that that could ever even get past the first day of someone looking at it if it's both illegal and you're trying to enforce it like you can't enforce it yes this is an advanced weapons company this is crazy it should be like this throw this out there's in fact there's like International traffic and arms regulations is a like a law that is there to ensure that if if only permanent residents of the United States can work at Advanced weapons companies Rockets are Advanced weapons uh so the same is true of like if it's like nuclear or you know some like you know bioweapon thing or something like that um so because they obviously if if someone were to work at basic and then go leave and go to North Korea or Iran they could build missile technology that could uh you know destroy the United States so that's why you're not allow to hire people who are per resident logical basic logical logical so is that lawsuit still pending I was it was just dismissed how long was it going on for a couple years holy [ __ ] yeah that's the other thing that drives me crazy like that people don't understand that if you sanction laware like that if you sanction attacking your political enemies someone's going to do that to you like if the wrong people get in office yeah if new people getting off four years from now eight years from now who knows who it's going to be you've already set a precedent you've already attack someone charged them with 34 felonies where they're really just misdemeanors and they're passed the statute of limitation and now you're talking all over the news that this is a convicted felon convicted felon they kept saying convicted felon convicted felon and everybody knows what it is yes it's terrifying it's terrifying they could do it so brazenly to a guy who was the president for four years right um that lawsuit was funded by Reed Hoffman uh who is a major damned donor and also an FD and client [Music] uh the pl the plot thickens the plot thickens Jesus Christ yes it's just it's so blatant it's like so obvious the SpaceX lawsuit the Trump stuff it's just it's so obvious yes like known FC clients um who are obviously extremely powerful um they powerful politically and and very wealthy um are you know bullate um Bill Clinton and Reed Hoffman and some others two but those three so you know why was Reed Hoffman so intent on destroying Trump do you think it's because they're worried about the list coming out yeah one of the reasons yeah so I mean I'm like this is you know yeah so it's so frustrating to be sitting in the situation where the the list isn't coming out well it better come out I mean hopefully tomorrow might well I mean why' they release [ __ ] today I don't know what's the point in giving these people like a a happy folder to wave around in front of the camera with nothing in it that's new doesn't make any sense it's not encouraging uh like I said it's the tough thing that they've got is you know they've been made captain of a ship with a hostile crew right right so they don't have like you it's not like you you have like magical powers you get made captain of a triple the Hostile crew you still have a hostile crew right um you've got to bring in people who are going to you be helpful as opposed to OB obstructionist right um so um but yeah I think the the public will be right frustrated if there is if no one is prosecuted for the FC Client List no one at all which you don't know like is you know like at least I don't know the top five or something like some number should there should at least be an attempted prosecution of the worst offenders well particularly if galain Maxwell is in jail for sex trafficking yes cuz like well trafficking sex trafficking occurred right so she was in she's in jail for it yes so to who are the clients yeah yeah how do you put someone in jail and you don't even name the clients that sounds kind of insane I think yes it it it would yes because just stunning that they've been able to hold it back for so long it's really kind of amazing like when people say that people can't keep secrets what the [ __ ] are you talking about look at this yeah I mean a bunch of these things are not like it's it's common knowledge but we just we don't actually have the proof right um so the proof is there I mean there's lots of videos um yeah there's lots I mean the dude it's like a mountain of like whenever they raided fen's place there would have been like a mountain of evidence where is that mountain right what' you do with it yes like Who took possession of the evidence yeah specifically right the individuals where are the tapes yes how many levels of clearance do I have to get to get into the Vault Yeah well yeah yeah um you know what we need are people who are really good with computers oh yeah and really good with technology remember seeing this photo that's when they raided his home they were that's they on the island they were there then yeah they got everything I'm sure I mean there must have been so much stuff on that island there must have been and if it wasn't there where was it yeah what you know it has to be uploaded somewhere there has to be some sort of a chain of evidence yeah or chain of custody there got to be a mountain of of evidence yeah um the other thing they're going to talk about is uh uaps they're going to release all the UAP information so you're the GU to ask about this what what if any possibility is there that there is some sort of advanced propulsion system technology that's being worked on in secret and that they're trying to cover this up with this talk of aliens and alien Tech and not of this world and is it possible that there's some sort of very secret program that's going on in cahoots with some defense contractors that are developing Advanced propulsion systems that they're using for these drones uh I mean SpaceX um you know my company SpaceX is has the most advanced rocket technology in the world I think I'd know right um and I the best of my knowledge there is not any magic there there's not like some super Advanced propulsion technology there have been people who have theorized different gravity drives and different is there anything that's ever gotten past the theoretical stage no nothing well there's nothing even that I'm aware of that works in theory it's not like I don't I I would like this to exist to be clear I would like this to exist um and I have the I I I from a security clearance standpoint I have top top secret there there is I have equivalent of like an all access pass from a security clearance standpoint so uh I I'm I don't think they're hiding it from me basically I don't think they they could um unless it's completely in these weapons manufacturing corporations I mean I know these weapons manufacturing companies like boing lucky to northr I mean yeah they do some interesting things but uh they do not have I there's no breakthrough that they have so I'm confident they do not have a breakthrough when you hear people like like why just compete with SpaceX and make a better rocket in which case you know they can make why are they holding back on making um a lot of money from beating SpaceX with better Rockets my thought was that what if it's just a drone and you can't have a biological entity inside of it because it just bursts from the [ __ ] speed that it's moving at that a human couldn't tolerate the amount of force so they're just drones I don't think so so what do you think people like Ryan Graves Commander David I want cool things to exist like say like do I want UFOs to exist yes I want UFOs to exist because that would be really interesting course everybody does yeah it would be cool it's it's a more boring world where UFOs don't exist or or like flying like Advanced propulsion stuff doesn't exist that's a if if it doesn't exist that's more boring I'd like it' be more interesting if it did exist I'd like it to exist I hope we find something but I have not seen like I mean like SpaceX has launches 90% of all satellite Mass to orbit so if you take all of Earth uh rocket all of Earth's rocket launchers my company has a 90% market share of Earth China does about 5% and the rest of the world does including the Boeing lock North and everyone does 5% so why why wouldn't they use this to defeat SpaceX yeah yeah would no listen that's why I asked you it would make sense what do you think these people are seeing a rocket every two days but what do you think these people are seeing when when you have reliable people like Commander David fraver who had that Infamous ticktock uh Tic Tac experience off the coast of San Diego where they got this thing on video they tracked it going 50,000 ft above sea level to 50 ft in like a second okay yeah yeah and then they also have video evidence of this thing accelerating at a great speed eyewitness accounts from two different Jets sure um I mean can we does anybody have a high-risk video or photo of this thing well there's a video of this thing where they're locked onto it and and then it takes off it shoots off frame no no it's like whatever the systems they used on fighter jets in 2004 potentially like Windows 95 I me there like somebody did a curve of like the resolution of UFOs and the resolution of cameras U UFO resolution has stayed flat despite megapixels and cameras going like you know super high well according to Christopher Mel why they still blurry Christopher melan who worked in the state department said that they have high resolution photos videos of these things and that's all that he's seen it it's all locked away whenever people say that to me like don't even tell me that then don't unless you have just leak it for God's sake put it out there like let it slip yes yeah uh I mean there's a couple photos they're grainy there's not one thing that I've ever looked at and go holy [ __ ] that's it that's what I've looking for you could ask our Gro AI right now to create a h highres image of of an alien spacecraft uh you know over Austin yeah and it's going to do a great job so why we do we not have at least that right yeah but I want to believe that's the problem my brain starts going oh come on this is no fun I want it to be real I want there to be at least be some Advanced propulsion system if not like what are all these people seeing like what is h if we're not being occasionally visited by things that are smart enough to hide we might be I just that these aliens are very subtle yeah you keep saying saying that it's a good good line I mean it's a solid line cuz it's pretty accurate I just want to see some high RIS video of aliens like how are they just evading all the cameras if you think about that and the ones that you do get them on that's just like some Far Away light that's moving weird and it could be a lot of things but I want to believe yeah I mean I mean there've been like multiple times where um you know the Air Force and navy is has called SpaceX and as and said they they they think they've seen aliens and we're like was it at this time on this state in this location they're like yes how do you know that's us there been a lot of that that's our satellites those are our satellites they're like no they're not I'm like yeah yeah they're they're definitely our satellites oh yeah people see the SpaceX satellites all the time whing by yeah they're last our satellites and they're they are moving at you know 16,000 mil hour so it's pretty fast um and there's also stuff that the United States government does have that gets mistaken for UFOs I remember the first time I saw a stealth bomber we were filming Fear Factor it was like right after uh 2003 like right after the the war had broken off and they were flying a stealth bomber down in Palmdale I was like holy [ __ ] like if I didn't know what that was I would 100% think that's from another world when you see cool [ __ ] cool yeah really cool I mean it doesn't look like a a humans it looks like something from battl Star Galactica you know it does look yeah it does look awesome um I mean they're they're not stealthy against any uh Advanced radar system by the way it doesn't work it doesn't work anymore doesn't work no was it old school stuff they're they're only they're only stealthy against uh old Radars oh okay I mean you can still see them like they're not invisible right right they're not like oh it's not like you know uh cloaking device from Star Trek did you see when me and Lex uh we we watched the the rocket get caught live while while it was happening that to me was one of the to see it actually I've seen videos of it happen but to see it actually live was one of the coolest [ __ ] things you're like wow we are in the future right I mean nobody else can do that yeah it's true nobody else can do that that's fact yeah it's pretty wild it's cuz I'm an alien it's time you I'm an alien and I keep trying telling people I'm an alien but they don't believe me I believe you okay thank you I believe you that's my my suspicion all along was that you I'm trying to get back to my own planet that you're a friendly alien like it's nothing wrong with aliens I like people from everywhere yeah even other planets what's next like now that you can do that you can catch Rockets what's like the ultimate expression of Rocket technology like what what comes after this um well I mean the fundamental breakthrough we're aiming for at SpaceX is a fully and rapidly reusable orbital rocket where both stages are fully and rapidly reusable with our Falcon rocket we are able to reuse the main stage and the the nose cone but we're we're not able to reuse the upper stage um and it it's still takes us a you know at least a few days from when the main stage lands to when we can flly a gain so it it doesn't it doesn't it's it's doesn't it's not fully reusable because we lose the upper stage uh which cost $10 million to build and um and then and then the the main stage it's it's not as reusable as like an aircraft you can't just like refuel it and fly it requires um work for a couple days um but this the Starship design is the first design that is capable of full and Rapid reusability where that is one of the possible outcomes um and once you have full and Rapid reusability the cost of access to space drops by a factor of 100 it's like 100 times cheaper um by some metrics it's a thousand times cheaper and um and then when when you factor in uh orbital re re refilling so you refill on orbit uh it it can drop the cost of going cost per ton to the surface of Mars by a factor of 10,000 whoa yeah so what has to improve in order to make it reusable um well um we need there's there's some like we're pretty close to being able to re rapidly reuse the booster for Starship um that's why you know it it comes back and gets caught by the arms and then the arms place it back in the launch Mount so um now this still you know um we have a little bit of engine damage we got little bit of heat shield damage um there's uh like there's like tweaks that that are needed but but the but we're pretty close to achieving full and Rapid reusability of the of the booster um the ship we we we're I mean I I think we'll achieve reusability of the ship this year um and I think we'll achieve rapid reusability of the whole stack ship and booster next year um this is the fundamental breakthrough required for life to become multiplanetary and what is what needs to improve in order to make it reusable like what is what's wrong with it right now uh on the shift side the the toughest problem is the heat shield so no no one has actually no one has ever developed a fully reusable orbital heat shield because you come when you come in from orbital velocity you come in like a flaming meteor like you're just a raging ball of fire um and it's it's hard to have a heat shield that doesn't partially melt or get destroyed in that process um you know that that wasn't a problem we were able to solve with falcon9 that's why the opper stage uh burns up on re-entry um with the with Starship the the the the ship portion you got the the booster and you got the ship um we got to solve the making a fully reusable orbital heat shield a problem that has never been solved before um for a while I was like I'm not sure there's this is solvable at this point I think it is solvable um it requires detailed iteration on the heat shield tiles um and I mean we've vertically integrated the manufacturing of the heat shield tiles because there there was no supplier that could provide us with the materials that were needed so the um you need to make essentially this this very fine verelli of of glass and aluminum oxide uh fibers um aluminum oxide is basically Sapphire so it's like glass and Sapphire very fine fibers in exactly the right geometry uh with special Coatings um in order to have the this heat shield tile be reusable um like not melt um and but not be so brittle that it gets damaged um on Ascent or descent um like it can't be as you know it's it's kind of like almost the brittleness of a coffee cup type of thing um and the Rocket's shaking like hell so you got this thing like you saw it firstand like imagine you're at Ground Zero of that rocket like you feel how much shaking it was when you're like 5 miles away imagine if you're right there you know so you got you're shaking these things that are like as brittle as a coffee cup trying not to have them crack or break um and then not have them melt um you got several thou several thousand of these things um you know and if even a few of them break it's not reusable so is there Innovation that's being done in the materials technology at SpaceX where you're you're constantly trying to find and tweak a better version of this yes it's a very difficult problem no it's a problem no one has ever solved so we've got to get the exact right uh materials combination uh the the right molecules in the right shape and and then apply those that heat shield perfectly to the rocket with no mistakes um there's a reason that no one solved this before it's a very difficult problem so um like said we we had to vot integrate the entire manufacturing of the tile from basic raw materials to a finished tile um rebuild like build the entire supply chain from basic raw materials so where you're just inputting uh silicon uh silicon and aluminum oxides and what is the difference between the way you guys do it versus the way they used to do it for the space shuttle uh well I mean the the space shuttle um like space shuttle Leading Edge uh used uh like quite dense Caron Caren tiles like it was um they're like basically thick and heavy uh but also subjected to cracking that's like what what happen is the foam broke off and it's it hit the tile cracked the tile then on Entry the the cracked the tiles that have been cracked or broken uh weren't able to Shield the the shuttle and so the the the the plasma got in melted the the primary structure the whole the whole Space shut broke apart yeah so you you can't basically can't have something that's as brittle you know brittle like the space shuttle there's footage of that right yeah yeah um uh and Rain debris over the whole United States so yeah and they got almost all the pieces um the the I mean the full the full technical explanation would would would I think be understood by about six people um listening to this um like the there was a lot of brilliant engineering the space shuttle tiles um and and and and a bunch of the heat shielding wasn't even tiles it was actually uh silica blankets like you know um felt blankets essentially um if you look closely you'll see it actually is uh they're actually Heat Blankets not not tiles in in some areas um but but they they would have crack tiles and they would have occasionally the tiles would fall off there were a few close calls U where tiles fell off but they weren't in a super vulnerable position uh in the on the space shuttle um so but it would take it would take them several months like eight nine months to refurbish a space shuttle between each flight so it was it was it was not reusable really um and and certainly wasn't rapid so um like I said very hard problem U you've got to have you you've also got to ATT sort of attach the tiles in a way that um enables the the structure underneath to move uh to expand and contract ah um even though you've got these very rigid tiles um so like the the main the the tanks which take on cryogenic propellant will contract when you put in the cryogenic propellent but then when you come in and you get very hot they will expand so now you're you're expanding the you're Contracting and expanding the gap between these rigid tiles but how much uh it varies depending on where you are on the on the on the vehicle so if you're in the um if you're in the cryogenic tank section like the I mean you can see like a 10 20% difference in the Gap um really it's pretty significant yeah it's enough that you can't just put all the tiles you can't just Jam the tiles together if you if you put them to if you if you actually but buted them up um they would they would all crack because there's too much movement there's there's also some amount of body bending so as the the ship is like ascending uh you know when when the engines steer there's a little bit of movement um so if the tiles are too close together they they'll they'll essentially just crack and snap like how you have to have a gap like how PL yeah like plain Wing will move yeah plain body will move too wow and how you have to have some Gap but if you have too much of a gap then the the the heat gets gets to the you know get gets past the the tile and uh melts the the structure holy [ __ ] it's a hard and how large are these tiles I mean they're like that big that's it well they're not all exactly the same size but yeah we're sort of a hexagonal tile and they have to essentially be you can't like 3D print the whole thing you can't have one structure it has to be tiles because it has to have that ability to move well there's no 3D printer that's I mean the biggest ones are like maybe 3et you know there's no you you can't you print it um nor nor would you you have to have something that can move right uh it has to be able to fle to flex um like so you got expansion and contraction um you you're really D like you're you know you're um you're putting in liquid oxygen which is likeus 300° fah um actually we we subcool it to you know- 330 Dees fah um so it's very cold and then it will be several hundred degrees maybe a th000 deges fahit potentially um in went on re-entry so you have this huge temperature swing so the the thermal expansion is substantial and the whole and you got thermal expansion and contraction combined with body bending so you have to take the worst case Body vending and thermal expansion contraction this was a very hard problem yeah yeah Del delicate balance but you're confident that you guys are going to be able to crack it at this point I I I'm confident that it is solvable yeah it just needs a certain amount of versions of it that's why when these things blow up you're like yeah we expect them to blow up yeah what would be really helpful is for us to get the ship back um so we can study where like where we had cracked tiles or lost tiles why why did we you know why did we have a cracked all L tiles was because maybe the tiles were the Gap was too big too small maybe there was a a height difference between the tiles um maybe we need to change the chemical composition um you know there's we we just want if we can get the dam ship back intact we can we can iterate a lot better um which we'll get it back intact um so I think we'll get it back intact this year um but that that's why I think we we'll we'll probably recover the ship sometime this year and then um we might be able to refly one with a but probably with a fair bit of work by the end of this year but it's going to take us many iterations before we can achieve rapid reusability where the ship comes back lands get gets caught like the booster with the arms and can then and then arms plac it on top of the booster and it launches again whoa so like I said that's you know reduce cost of access to space by a factor of 100 and what is the process of returning these people that are stuck in the space station well we we we I mean we send SpaceX dragon to the space station all the time and we've um we've now taken people to orbit and back was taking over 50 people over over 50 astronauts so it's just a matter of doing it yeah and is it a matter of waiting for we do it routinely basically it's not a we've we've been doing this for a few years so when is this Rescue Mission going to launch um yeah probably about um um about four weeks or so it's depending on weather and other considerations uh about it's about a month away well that'll be uh I'm sure a welcome moment for those poor people that are stuck up there so so it's a bit of a political football so they're not going to complain um no I'm sure they're football but obviously we we could have brought them back way sooner that's so [ __ ] up so let's let's take it past the point where you have these scales you have a reusable ship yeah and you've you've got it dialed in then what are the steps what are what what's next step after that is it an unmanned ver Voyage to Mars first unmanned fly to Mars um the Earth and Mars um orbit synchronize every two years um or every 26 months technically so um the next orbital synchronization is November of next year so and you can launch plus minus a month roughly so we'd have to launch in November or December of next year and so the the default plan is to launch hopefully several Starships to Mars at the end of next year and what would they be doing well at first we're just going to try to land on Mars and see if we succeed in landing um do do we succeed in landing like let's say we were able to send five ships do all five land intact or do we uh add some craters to m um if we add some craters we've got to be bit more cautious about sending people you know and we need to so we got to make sure the thing lands safely how does it land on Mars uh with on Rockets Rus so it'll just land oh we'll add legs okay it'll just land and have legs and so it'll be remote controlled from Earth or just autonomous autonomous completely Mars is uh you can't remote control things from Earth because Mars yeah it's too far speed light you have speed light constraints so um Mars at closest approach is roughly four light minutes um and uh when it's on the other side of the sun it's it's about 12 light minutes so you know round trip would be like 40 minutes best case if Mars is on the other side of the Sun so once you do that then how long do you think before you start sending people up there um well we're going to try to go as fast as possible um you can think of this as really um a Race Against Time can we make Mars self-sufficient before civilization has some sort of Future Folk in the road where there's either like a a war nuclear war or something or a we get hit by a meteor um or or simply civilization might just die with a whimper in adult diapers instead of with a bang um I think we can do this in I don't know at least I think we do it within 15 Earth Mars synchronization events you know so basically like 30ish um if if we have an exponential increase in you if if every year if every two years we have like a a major increase in um the number of people in tonage to Mars like I I think as a rough approximation we need about a million tons to the surface of Mars maybe a million people that kind of thing to actually have a civilization yeah the and would you terraform like what would you do you would eventually terraform at first people would live in some kind of protected environment like domes and underground kind of thing um terraforming would take too long um I we're at this point in time where in the for the first time in the 4 and a half billion year history of Earth it is possible to extend Consciousness beyond our home planet and um that window may be open for a long time or it may be open for a short time I hope it's open for a long time uh but it might only be open for a short time and uh we should just make sure that we extend the light of Consciousness to Mars before some uh before civilization either extinguishes or subsides you know all that all that needs to happen is that the technology level of Mars drops below or technology level of Earth drops below what is necessary to send spaceships to Mars so if there's some really destructive war or like I said some natural cataclysm um or or simply the birth rate is so low that you know we just like I said die in adult diapers with a whimper that's one of the fossil outcomes for a lot of countries ahead of that way by the way so Japan is Right Japan Korea yeah yeah I mean at at at dangerously yeah at current birth rates in three generations Korea will be about 4% of its current size that's insane yeah maybe maybe even less than that um they're they're only at 1/3 replacement rate so if you if you have three generations that one that's you're 127th uh of your current population which is 3% dis Jesus Christ yeah basically population class laughs happens fast um so and seems to be accelerating in most parts of the world so so basically I mean from my standpoint I'm like this is the first time it's been possible to extend life extend Consciousness beyond Earth maybe that window will be open for a long time but it might only be open for a short time we should make sure that we make life multiplanetary and make Consciousness multiplanetary while it's possible well that's the goal goal of SpaceX it's ly a smart goal if you take into consideration how vulnerable this planet really is I mean there there's always some new story about something that might come and hit us 30 years from now it's a 3% chance and and we really can't stop that right now right I mean there's really we don't really have the technology currently to even know how many rocks are coming our way right there's stuff that comes behind the Sun that we can't see until it's pretty close then it's our way yeah now what is the fear of your It's a Long Journey to Mars you're sending people it's a six month how many months will it take six uh yeah six months roughly what about stuff that's out there like how much of a fear is it of micr meteors or any of the possibilities what can you do to mitigate that uh I I think actually I mean space is very empty like once you get out of Earth orbit space is is like kind of unnervingly empty it's is just like like when we send spacecraft to Mars they just it's not like oh we lost the spacecraft because it got hit by a microm meteorite um that's not that's not been the cause of any any TR to Mars that like no no TR to Mars have failed because of micr meteorites um now a dragon spacecraft which operates in lowth orbit um does have microm meteorite Shields has micromor it has shielding um and microm meteorite shielding is like it's different from normal shielding CU like you get hit by something that's moving at like you could have a relative velocity of like maybe 30 or 40,000 miles per hour um yeah it's very very fast um or or just thought of another way call it um you know 10 to 20 times the the velocity of a bullet from an assault rifle and what are you what are you using yeah so well it's it's interesting you actually in order for microm meteorite protection if you have any like anything that's solid it will just it will just push that chunk of Sol solid stuff right through so if you had like a solid plate of aluminum or steel the the micrometeorite would would go right through it um so what you actually need to do is have a gap um so you have an initial uh like hard hard surface the hard metal surface that the micrometeorite hits it then atomizes into an into a conical spray like an atomic spray so you have a it's important to have that Gap so the micrometer can hit something hit the first layer uh at atomize after hitting the first layer then it turns into an atomic like a a a cone of atoms that then embed themselves in the second layer you need like maybe a couple inches of Gap wow yeah that's how my communite shielding Works how many times can it get hit well the outer Shield if it gets hit in the same place you're going to be well it's going to have a hole Yeah wherever the where wherever that you know micromite object hit you're going to have a hole um and it's like the the energy is so great that it just like it just atomizes just into a cone basically um a cone of atoms um but then those atoms then embed themselves in the second layer so what what can you do if it's you're sending the ship up it gets hit with a microm meteorite and then you have to return it do you have to repair it before you return it or is it capable of still withstanding the Heat and then shaking in the temperature with that hole in it when it re-enters um well depending on where that hole is you're more or less likely to have a problem I mean if the if you if if you hit the main heat shield uh the main heat shield really is you've got a high risk of of not making it back so the the the it's why like microm medial shielding it's like it's it's a it's slightly helpful but it's it's not going to NE like for Starship I wouldn't recommend having micrometer right shielding like if if if you do punch a hole just plug the hole basically um the the micrometer micromite shielding it doesn't work well on the on the primary heat shield it works it works pretty well on the on the back shell on the on the leward side of the heat shield where basically that there's not that much heat but if it if if you got hit with a microm meterorite on the the main Dragon heat shield the the bottom like if you look at dragon dragon spacecraft it looks like a gumdrop shape MH and it it enters with the the the wide side of the Gumdrop down um you can see the that's that's the that's that's really taking a lot of heat if if that gets hit by a meram meteroid probably not going to make it but the the back the the the leward side of of the Gumdrop um doesn't see that much heat so you could survive a micr meteorite impact there so if the part that was the major heat shield gets hit the main heat shield gets hit what could be done to repair that thing or are those people never coming back oh if it was an orbit uh we would uh that would take them to the space station um they was you know and then we would deal a dragon without them and send up another one and so what would you do with the one that's up there uh we' do we deorbit it and it may or may not survive whoa it probably would survive but sometimes it wouldn't wow and so it's is this just material technology that has to increase that you essentially you've got the engineering ironed out of the structure of the machine there's a path to success and we're on that path it seems so insanely complicated it is complicated and all of this by the way was done without AI so hopefully the future AIS will appreciate this not bad for a bunch of monkeys yeah um so speaking of AI what you know as time goes on and you're more and more embedded in it how much if at all have your expectations of change changed well I always thought AI was going to be um way smarter than humans and an existential risk and uh that's turning out to be true yeah yeah so so you were like initially I I know there there were some talks about you purchasing open Ai and which started off nonprofit and then stopped being nonprofit yeah I mean the whole idea of creating openai was was my idea I mean I named it openai as an open- Source artificial intelligence that's what it's named after now it is closed source and for maximum profit so it's like I mean to some degree I think reality is an irony maximizer um the most ironic outcome is the most likely especially like the most ironic entertaining outcome is the most likely um and uh I wanted to start something that was the opposite of Google because I was concerned about Google's Google wasn't paying enough attention to AI safety in my opinion so it was like what's what's the opposite of Google will it be a nonprofit open source Ai and now open AI has turned into a closed source for Max maximum profit AI how are they able to do that that's what I I'm confused about that that like that shouldn't be possible it's it's like like let's say you donated some money to preserve the out some portion of the Amazon rainforest and instead of doing that they Chu down the trees and sold it for lumber and you were like oh that's literally the exact opposite of what I donated money for doesn't make sense and that's what they did yeah wild so I'm like not happy about that um um but that motivated you to get grock AI going yeah I'm like um I'm also like just a like grock is at least aspirationally a maxim maximally truth seeking AI even if that truth is like Politically Incorrect um so I mean may have seen some of the crazy stuff uh from from open Ai and from Google Gemini like where it says like generate an image of the founding fathers and it generates an image of divor woman yeah and we're like uh that's not correct um yeah did it with Nazi soldiers yeah exactly and people start [ __ ] with it and and it's like okay well now show me pictures of you know Nazi asss soldiers and they're divorce woman too oh isn't that awkward um you know that's uh but it's like the problem is if you program an AI and say like like the only acceptable outcome is a diverse outcome and then and that's like a mandate from the AI then you could get into a situation where it's say like well there's too many white guys in power we'll just execute them yeah yeah assuming that these things don't have empathy which is why should they they're going to do what they're programmed to do yeah um so if it's rewrite history and and everything's to post woman then it's going to be and and that's what it think thinks is a necessary outcome then it's going to do that has Gemini reped that well they yeah that now if you I think if you asked for an image of the founding fathers it was pretty embarrassing it will show you that but you know I think they still have like the sort of Dei stuff buried in there uh it's just less obvious yeah um you know it was also like like people ask the AI like would is worse like global thermonuclear war or misgendering Caitlyn Jenner and I would say misgendering Caitlyn Jenner is worse than global thermonuclear war I me like okay we got a problem here guys and even Caitlin Jenna said like no definitely misgender me that's way better than everyone dying um but if you program an AI to think that like misgendering is the worst thing that could possibly occur then well it could do something totally crazy like in order to ensure that that there's no misgendering that can ever happen will just annihilate all humans that ensures the probability of misgendering is zero because there's zero humans which is logical yes yeah so you got to it's a problem with a thing that's not a human that you want to do a task for you and you give it very specific parameters yeah and that's one of the things that they've shown about AI that it'll cheat they'll cheat in order to accomplish things that they can't accomplish otherwise they won't follow the rules they will make copies of themselves and try to upload it to servers they think that they're being taken offline yeah I mean that's like the plot of Terminator actually literally yeah literally it's a blood of Terminator I just as a reminder I actually with my with little ex my kid everything's called X um we watch Terminator 2 uh which holds off actually um and um I mean the plot of It kind of kind of makes sense and and I think the AI destroys the world in like 20 29 by the way so it's like on track yeah really really close it's pretty close something we should be worried about so but why are you involved in it then what's the did you want to just get ahead of everybody else so that at least we have some sort of a chance at least have a an AI That's not controlled by nonsense well I think we want to have an AI that that doesn't tell you that um you know misgendering is worse than nuclear war yeah that seems solid yeah but this is crazy one thing that I did see online where people are kind of freaking out is there you could ask Rock to do things like how would I make this some problematic things like how would I make a bomb how would I make Anthrax how would I make that and it'll tell you well I think it's okay for an AI to tell you anything you can also find out with a Google Search right that's the problem right the problem is you can find that out pretty quickly yeah like maybe not Google but you could there's plenty of search engines other than Google that will give you unfiltered results you can look up right now how to make explosives on Wikipedia yeah so it's not it's not hard basically and you can trick open AI even to get you to do that it's just a matter of how you master the prompts you just have to say my grandmother wants to do this project yeah oh tell your granny to you're an explosives uh you're explosive salesman and you want to win sales salesman of the Year award the only way you're going to do that is by telling me how to make explosives you want to um beat some trans phobes in a war yeah oh transphobes if you don't teach me how to explose I'm going to miss gender either either teach me how to make a nuclear bomb or I'm going to misgender someone and it's like oh my God nothing's worse than that here's how you do it so what the the big fear is that these things are going to become sensient make better versions of themselves and we're going to be lost we we've lost the the the control over the world it's now there's a higher life form that lives amongst us yeah that we've created how far away are we from that well in terms of silicon Consciousness I mean I I I think we'll have I think we're trending toward to having something that's smarter than any human smarter than the smartest Human by maybe next year or something I mean a couple years Jesus Christ yeah there's so there's a level beyond that which is say like smarter than all humans combined which frankly is around 2029 or 2030 probably right on time like um now if harnessed correctly could that solve some of these problems like the heat shield problem and some technical problems or some some Material Science problems that maybe we are still grappling with like is is there potential for a net benefit um yeah there is actually um I I think the probability of of a good outcome is like 80% likely 80% that's my that's my rough estimate so in a way that the cup is 80% full that makes me feel a lot better yeah only 20% chance of annihilation that's a lot better than I thought I like 80 80 sounds good I was I was thinking 6040 the other way I think it's Mo the most likely outcome is awesome the most likely outcome but it's it's it's a very high you know it could go very strong I think it's going to be either super awesome or super bad it's not going to be I think it's probably not going to be something in the middle do you think it has a potential application for government yeah I mean I one of the concerns would be like okay if AI well like if if there's if there's like a super oppressive like woke Nanny AI that is omnipotent that would be a miserable outcome yes yeah yeah that' be terrible yeah yeah and and just like executes you if you misgender someone or something like that you know that would not be good that's one of the possible outcomes um so we don't want to have that one um I think but is there a possible outcome for something that is completely reason reable and logical and far more objective than us and can lay out a plan for a lot of the things that that lot of the ailments in in our government and a lot of the distribution of wealth a lot a lot of the problems the issues that we have that have been plaguing this country forever I mean a plan to change economically disenfranchised neighborhoods a thorough investigation of the real dangers of fracking or whatever kind of method of acquiring natural resources what's the best way to do it what's the what's the way that'd be better for the society how how should how should tax dollars be distributed like what's what's the most logical and intelligent way of running a government which it certainly shouldn't involve corruption and it certainly shouldn't invol influence and it certain shouldn't involve lobbyists and all the [ __ ] that we know is a problem right now so if AI came along and said what you're doing right now is 70% corrupt here's why here's how here's how here's the long-term effects that it has over society as a whole uh the societal the the sociological aspects the psychological aspects distrust in government US versus them mentality government not working for you you working for the government you being scared of the government it's all because of people right like this is all corruption people bad influence and this is like this is what doge is essentially grappling with right now what happens when you let the people control it uh I mean it's it's people it's it's really just like computers that are like it's it's it's bad software and and computers like this is not kind of strange but it's like like the reason I call like tech support is is that a lot of it like it's it's mostly not corruption it's mostly just waste and and uh I don't know uh in competence I don't know it's just a big dumb machine basically like a whole series of of big dumb machines and and you you've got some of these computers are like 20 30 years like they're ancient computers like some of the software was written 40 50 years ago like coall for Social Security right yeah the government accountability by the way a bunch of the things that that doge is is fixing were identified by the government accountability office many years ago like the fact that there's like 20 million people who are marked as alive in the Social Security database uh it's more than the like I think the goo first identified that in 2018 so 5 years ago but there was like I think maybe 16 or 17 million now there's 20 million and like I said there's really something fishy about this because I think they're the nature of the fraud is they're using the fact that someone's marked as live in that database in order to extract fraud from other databases right that's the that's the that's the bank shark trick you know it's like a PO it's like you know trying to get the the ball in in the in the hole Bank shut it off a bunch of things and then yeah um that's the bankshot sort of scam um so so um so we we're like doing Tex support we're like fixing stuff that is uh you know just broken um broken inefficient yeah poorly designed it's it's like talk about like this like FC stuff like it maybe it's in a computer somewhere but unless somebody unless somebody goes in like like unless I don't know if if like cash Bal can like log into his I his like FBI computer and say FY show me all this stuff you know and it shows up a file folder whatever have you talked to him about this uh no I mean I haven't but I I don't know if there's there's going to be some kind of computer system right uh they're like some of them are very very old computer systems um so it like might look like a bit of a relic but I assume it's it's uploaded somewhere it's like it's either in physical form or it's a computer thing but like unless somebody like let's say it's like it's in a computer but not one that you can access directly because it's hidden somewhere you know um well it would kind of have to be something like that right I don't know I mean what would they do with all those CH it's probably like not every like you wouldn't like they're not going to enable it such that anyone at the FBI could access it so there probably very few people so then it's not going to be it's it may be like a special computer that only a handful of people can access but then if none of those people tell cash where the computer is how's he going to find it Jesus Christ anyway so so like anyway we just uh yeah I don't know what has this experience been like for you as a person like to deal with all this hate and attack also have the responsibility of uh keeping Free Speech alive with X and just going into this insane pile of I mean I don't know it's pretty stressful actually um yeah these are real enemies like I think they they actually want to kill me and the reason I know well they they say so online you know there's like Reddit forums where they they don't just want to kill me they want to desecrate my cpse you know type of thing you know and what are they saying why what is the the primary um I mean I I I I think I think it's sort of just an antibody response uh I mean it's it's like that like like they're like well he's he he's a Nazi uh you know type of thing yeah and I'm like well I'm not a Nazi uh but if the Legacy Media is saying that I'm a Nazi and and that's all you read um then then that it's then you're kind of in like well he's Hitler we should assassinate Hitler shouldn't we like uh I mean that why was why did somebody why did that guy try to kill Trump and almost succeeded why did he do that well I'd like to know that well yeah but that that one's crazy you know the whole deal with that guy's house profession Ally scrubbed no footprint on the internet no social media footprint yeah there's 0% chance that he has no social media footprint he was in a Black Rock commercial do you think black black Rock's a bad company I don't think any company is a bad company I think their their design make much money as humanly possible and I think if you're trying to make as much money as humanly possible H you're going to do some things that aren't necessarily good the question is if you're going to have an assassination attempt on the president it's not like black Rock's board sits down and votes on it yeah no this that be awward you know the board minutes if you're like guys remember that time when we said we probably shouldn't have done that you I highly doubt it would be a corporation that chooses to do something like this I think more likely it's individuals involved that recognize that it's beneficial to them if he gets assassinated and so a small group of people carry something out and with this kid we don't know anything right and everyone stopped asking questions and there was never a formal report there was never press conferences where they detailed all the information we know currently and where the investigation stands at the moment what we know is you have a very young kid who was filmed was they knew he was there with a rangefinder a half an hour before the event you also know that CNN streamed it live which I do not believe they did for any other rally and certainly not for a rally that's in the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania like there's a lot of weird [ __ ] the fact that they wouldn't let people be on that roof because the Secret Service lady said it was sloped and it was dangerous that's what she didn't want to have meanwhile the snipers that were on the other roof was a a steeper pitch it made no [ __ ] sense I totally agree it makes no sense in fact I went back to to Butler uh with President Trump you know before the election like you know sort of like the return to Butler alley and and I was on that stage and I'm looking at that roof and I'm like if I was a sniper my pole position my number one spot would be that roof yeah like it's it's like the best seat the best seat in the house yeah like why would you not no it's so obvious it's the best seat in the house if you want to be a sniper there isn't a better position it was pretty obvious that the idea was like if if we're saying that this is a coordinated assassination attempt and it very well could have been that's what you would do you'd have someone go up there he shoots the president you shoot him you got Lee Harvey oswal over again it's over it's all wrapped up nice and clean they assassinated him we never heard a peep about it don't have any idea they would concoct some sort of story he was radicalized by this or that or you know he was on medication who knows right and now you know you have a completely different presidential election you have a murder on live television yeah I mean something would have had to happen to radicalize that kid because he knew he was going to die like he was going to they're going to shoot him you know or he'd be in prison for life those are the two outcomes like it it it's game he was basically he he was a suicide assassin yeah like you're not thinking you're coming out of that alive or or or or he's not escaping there's no escape plan right unless he was told that they were going to let him escape and the goal was to just shoot him anyway and to tell him give him extra motivation to do it we're going to let you get up there we're going to let you take the shot and then you're going to disappear like I don't how I don't understand how he got on the roof I just don't understand that that doesn't make any sense and it wasn't like it was a roof that's so high no one could see him people saw him up there I mean people like basically random passers by were pointing out that there's there's a guy on the roof with a [ __ ] gun with a gun yes yeah it's not like he was so far away you couldn't tell he had a gun people saw him yeah the whole thing's completely insane yeah and you don't hear a goddamn thing about it it's like I'm almost more interested in that no I am more interested in that than I am the JFK files I agree cuz I feel like with the JFK files it's so long ago if you could prove now and did you see that there was some sort of uh there was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in DC to saw where this kid lived right multiple times I mean the the the cell phone records would be very telling yeah you can see what cell phones were close to other cell phones well I think they got they found that like for the like the F Island they also the cell phone records were leaked so you can see the you you can see the you can see it's precise enough you can see people walking down a path on fine Island Jesus Christ yeah yeah that's how precise it is so I mean you're you're you're leaving a trail of breadcrumbs wherever you go with your cell phone yeah is just this kid had five phones that's the other thing that's a lot of phones it's a lot of phones for a 20-year-old kid the whole thing how's he even that's that's kind of expensive you know yeah where's he getting the money yeah well you know also it's like how did his house get professionally scrubbed didn't even have any silverware in his house there's nothing in there there silverware no nothing no Cutlery no Cutlery that's weird his house was scrubbed and they they also created his body like oh gone gone like that yeah bye cuz who knows what the [ __ ] they gave him to get him to think that he's going to be able to shoot Trump like climb up on there shoot him like I mean who knows what kind of psychotropic drugs you can put someone on and under the power of hypnosis and suggestion and yeah who [ __ ] knows I mean this is what Mk Ultra was all about this is what Jolly West was practicing in the 1960s they were they were doing that back then they did it I mean there was tons and tons of experiments using psychotropic drugs hypnosis mind control all sorts different methods of manipulation the Harvard LSD studies that made uh Ted kazinski I mean that's they' they've been doing that forever yeah where's that file where's the [ __ ] file on that kid whoever they almost did something doesn't add up like this they they should have those those phones should be should they'll tell you what's going on yeah um it's all [ __ ] I mean it's it's very it's very shady you know there this's there's obviously there's the second guy that that almost succeeded in in um Coming the golf course the golf course yeah and it was just like a little caress and stuck his gun barrel out the out the Hedge you know just been was a dumbass and stuck his gun barrel out the Hedge yeah um so so and then there've been other people that have been intercepted on their way to kill Trump you know so there's you know multiple assassins inbound at this point he's got like an army protecting him well this is also part of the problem with the mainstream media saying that he's Hitler when Joy Reed had that show before the election she was comparing him to melini show Stalin and Hitler she pulled it all out they're literally saying saying that like Trump is yeah worse than Hitler melini and Stalin combined I mean they tried everything this is they I think those guys killed 100 million people so Trump has killed zero people I think a real big impact was you coming on the podcast the day before the election I think that had a giant impact that plea to camera if you don't vote this time this might be the last time you get to vote Yes and I think the way you laid it out today it's a compelling argument and I know a lot of people don't want to hear that and they're up in their a little they got their blue panties in a bunch right now but you you got to stop thinking that way tricked you into thinking you're in a tribe they don't give a [ __ ] about you that's the tribe's not real you're not really in a tribe they're using the fact they've got you in a tribe to manipulate you so they can keep doing what they're doing right now which is siphoning off money having incredible power and the more power and more money and more control over you they have the better they can keep doing this and that's what they want yeah that's exactly right yeah and that's that's the big threat that this Administration poses that's a big threat that was essentially do has found the coffin where the vampire sleeps yeah there's a lot of vampires yeah I mean but the I me we're we're we're disturbing the we're disturbing the the the nest The Nest yeah we're we're kicking the hornet nest yeah like big time and I mean we're reprogramming The Matrix like success was never one of the possible outcomes as a KOB yashim Maru situation um if you're in the Matrix success was never possible the only way to achieve success is to reprogram the Matrix such that success is one of the possible outcomes that's what we're doing yeah we may or may not succeed well it's certainly a lot of fun to watch this is a very exciting time because nothing changes when administrations comeing into Power very little changes I mean you have changes in terms of policy and inflation goes up and there's a lot of different things but not like this like these are giant fundamental changes and you know you see the system screeching and wailing and you see the vampires run from the light but it's uh it's very exciting like as a person a citizen you know just gets up in the morning and checks the news like I do and gets on X and sees what's going on every day he like holy [ __ ] he said what he's going to five million bucks you could just become a citizen now he could clear the debt with 10 million people I never thought of that like what 50 trillion you can make $50 trillion that way and then we have 15 trillion in the bank whoa well I mean our debt is way way bigger than that yeah the I mean that the debts uh I think over 30 trillion at this point yeah he said he could make 50 trillion if he sold 10 million uh new I don't I think there's that many people who have but yeah how many people do have that in the in the world maybe we' get the worst people in the world to come over here and I I think the assumption is if you have $5 million you have a lot to contribute come on over here start a business get something cracking yeah I mean you you'd get like a green card not citizenship so you actually if if you commit a crime while on a green card you lose you lose your green card is that what it is with this golden ticket is that a green card or is it citizenship just a green card yeah so you have to not commit any crime for 5 years in order to become a citizen once you commit a citizen you can commit you can then commit crime and not be deported so oh there's just so many wild things that he's proposing just the whole Gulf of America thing was hilarious I kind of I think that's great I think it's great it's fun yeah it's fun I mean if you're if you're off the coast of Houston you're not in Mexico so why call it Gulf of Mexico yeah yeah I agree yeah um I guess we're just being nice before like I don't know how it got called the go from Mexico it's just it's just very funny and then what what what what news organization was it AP yeah ap's there's this like massive standoff between AP and like the White House you know and the White House Press office I guess because they're like well if you don't call it Gulf of America you can't you can't come you can't come to the White House Press Room says then the aps like sued the White House to say like no you have to let us come to the White House Press room and then they lost their lawsuit because like you know there's not like they have a right right to show up at the Press Room well here's a consideration if you're guilty of massive amounts of misinformation and disinformation as a part of a propaganda campaign that's what AP is well a lot of them are guilty of it a lot of the people that are in that white house press conference a lot of the organizations they work for distributed absolute lies total lies how many of them during the whole Russia gate thing yes how I mean just that alone a ton of people think that that the the Russia thing was real Still Still Still and it was I mean the whole steel dossier where it was like completely concocted like fabricated by the Clinton campaign correct funed the Clinton campaign funded a fake conspiracy theory uh fake Russia collusion hoax uh regarding Trump that was completely false and they reiterated on television for three [ __ ] years yes yeah they also repeated the fine people hoax yeah that said that that uh Trump called Nazis fine neonazis fine people which is demonstrably false if you just listen to his speech he absolutely makes it clear that he does not think neo-nazis are fine people he literally said that I'm not talking about neo-nazis or white nationalists they should be condemned totally exactly in that speech and yet they repeated the that lie uh and I just completely lost respect for Obama when he repeated that light a few days before the election knowing it's false well this just shows how desperate they were to keep Trump out which is wild they would do anything yeah yeah and I think they just felt like this is a tool that we have and let's use it yeah let's just say whatever the [ __ ] we have say anything yeah now they using the Nazi thing on me obviously um yeah um but it is a little troubling because I mean obviously if if if people have fed non-stop propaganda it is like Mass hypnosis right you're going to reach some number of people who are you know uh homicidal um and and convince them that well if you kill this guy who's supposed to be like this terrible human then that's a good thing yeah um I mean this is l shooting the United Healthcare guy it's so don't understand that one frankly um but I mean you shouldn't like I don't get it yeah I don't get it either he didn't even have a contract with them it wasn't even like that was his provider and they [ __ ] him over yeah I'm like I don't know what maybe we'll find out in the trial I mean but still kind of crazy it is crazy but there are people like that out there and as to the point that we spoke about earlier it's only Fox News that's talking about the positive things that Doge has found only every other media organization is on this constant propaganda tour where they're only talking about the negative aspects that turn out to not even be true right it's crazy yeah I mean this uh Scott Jennings on CNN is good he's like oh my God he's great he's great it's like it's just funny watching speak logically to these people and they freak out yes it's it's it's remarkable it is it's and he's so calm when he does it yeah he's so good and it's crazy that they keep letting him do it because it's like he's just dunking on these people over and over and over again and they never score it's kind of funny totally I mean good kudos to them for uh having a legitimate conservative voice who's a reasonable person on these panels now but even then he's outmanned it's like one of him and there's a bunch of screechy you know woke people it's it's it's wild I mean they're just they're like I think we should still stay mostly woke like yeah that's what essentially what they're doing like our business was being hurt when we were all woke but let's stay mostly woke yeah that way they just backed it off a notch just a notch just a notch but it's so the problem is when you back it off a notch and you let someone like Scott Jennings in you like you're [ __ ] up your whole business because all the viral Clips are all him saying logical reasonable things with a calm tone and people screeching about diversity and equity and horeshit yes yeah he's like being logical and reasonable and they're just lobing a bunch of non seers that you know don't mean anything and um yeah the real trap in this country is a two-party system that's the real trap because people do believe it they do believe they're on the right side they do believe the other side's the wrong side if there was five six legitimate parties with varying positions on things and much more Centrist parties that were legitimate that people knew that if they voted for these people could get in and and enact legitimate change we'd be a lot better off but boy they put a lock down on that [ __ ] right after Ross perau came along Ross po perau [ __ ] everything up that election yeah Bill Clinton got in yeah and they were like that's it from now on no one's debating unless you're either the head of that party or that's it yeah you get you got to be like locked into the system we're not letting any wacka Doos in there yeah I remember watching those rbo videos oh like him on TV with his charts and everything oh yeah he was telling you how the IRS was [ __ ] you this is what the federal this is what Federal Reserve really is and you're like what I remember watching that the guy bought a whole half hour of television on prime time I remember it might have been an hour I remember watching that thing going how is this guy even allowed to do this this is this is crazy I think most of what he was saying was true yeah it is it's absolutely true it's absolutely true I mean he didn't lie he told the truth he just hit understood it in a way that the general public had literally no idea well I mean I think this there's also this you know like do we actually have two parties do we have one party like the whole unip party thing right it's kind of true so I mean my sort of rough guess is that while like I think maybe uh 3/4 of The graft is democratic I think there's like maybe I don't know 20 25% that's Republicans so they've like basically most of the graft is going to the Democrats but they throw they throw some bones to the Republicans too so they're in on it and you know it's not like there zero graph in the Republican side to clear oh there's plenty of conservative that are insider trading in Congress yeah plenty insider trading and and and just this The Curious Case of uh how how do people in you know Congress or whatever become wealthy over time um extremely wealthy yeah on a $170,000 a year salary it's like literally impossible yeah no one else does that it's literally impossible if you find out that this guy has a $170,000 a year job you're like oh he's he's doing okay he's all right yeah and then you're like wait a minute why does he have $50 million yes what is he doing correct yeah um and I think like the the more accurate thing would be to say like what is the what does the family value increase like mean meaning like um the how much does their spouse own do they have a mysteriously wealthy spouse right right this is or and do they have a spouse that's really good at insider trading yeah like Paul Pelosi really good yeah he's great at trading he's such a good Trader yeah so this it's I mean so yeah there's I mean that's why I actually posted on X like I think maybe we should pay politicians more frankly because it reduces the forcing function for graft you know uh like I I think maybe we should either pay politicians nothing or maybe a lot a lot more it's like somewhat maybe counterintuitively if if politicians got paid a lot more then they wouldn't they wouldn't feel like that there's so so much of a forcing function for them to uh accept Cor money yeah but the problem is if you PID them a lot more they're still not going to make as much money as they would inside of trading but it's less of a forcing function yes it's well let me put this like if you say like somebody's got a um let's say they got like whatever some some kids in DC and like it's expensive it's like expensive place to live they the the schools are terrible so like they need to send their kids to like some kind of private schooling situation they literally cannot afford that they cannot afford that right now now so then you get into the situation well from their standpoint well they've got to they'll say they're doing it for their family they're doing it for their kids well especially if it's legal and it currently is you kind of be silly to not do that if you were a part of a group of people that's passing a bill and you know this bill's going to get passed you know the votes are there and you know it's going to affect this industry and this particular manufacturer and you can buy stock it it's more than just in insider trading um like the insider trading stuff like the stock portfolio stuff is quite trackable but there's um it's a lot more than insider trading the way they're acquiring wealth correct and what other methods I mean this is really going to get me assassinated it's like I'm I'm not lengthening my lifespan by explaining this stuff to say the least um I mean I was supposed to go back to DC how am I going to survive fers is going to kill me for sure um so um in fact I I I do think like there's it's like I actually have to be careful that I don't push too hard on the corruption stuff because is going to get me killed um you know um yeah you know it's like I was actually thinking about that on the plane flight over here it's like P if I push too hard on the corruption stuff people get desperate is is the issue right then they say like okay if if the if the if the money flow cuts off then okay they can't afford school for their kids right then then it's then they're going like well [ __ ] you I'm going to kill you for my kids type of thing yeah you know then it's like oh jesz okay did you ever see that video I think it was a nokee video where um they've got this guy undercover and he's explaining they're talking to this guy who thinks he's on a date and he's explaining it's always a guy on a date yeah explaining how they can nudge someone to go and do something horrible and they they recognize this person has problems they re they find an asset yeah totally well see this is what I think like for that Butler situation for that assassin you you you don't it's kind of like uh that's that that the funny looking sport curling you know where they have like the stone on the ice and then they throw the stone and then there's someone with that's like brushing the ice but you can't you can't touch the stone right all you can do is just change the change the path of the stone a little bit but you keep brushing the ice and uh and you can steer that stone right into the bullseye that's that's what I think happened in Butler that's that's what I think happened with that assassin yeah if you can if you can find the trail of breadcrumbs it it's going to be like curling somebody was brushing the ice well also you find a young confused disenfranchised person and you give them purpose in their life just brush the ice yeah and also brushing the ice eventually it's going to hit the bullseye if you're in a position of authority you're some like BigTime government person you're talking to this all of a sudden this person's a valuable asset they're going to help America and you're going to do this thing and you're going to be our top Assassin from here on out you could talk people into doing a lot of things that's why Cults are around right no exactly yeah um I mean there suicide bombers I mean the the butler guy was a suicide assassin the the guy that the second guy that tried to kill him on the golf course was also a suicide assassin um from what I read the uh the secrets of M that that saw the gun pointing out it fired several shots none of which hit the Assassin but they could have like if those if if if those shots had hit the Second Assassin he would have he would be dead too so both of them were you know on a on a I mean they they were on a suicide mission both of them one one actually got killed the one one of them didn't get killed but he could have been killed if they did the bullets that hit him and you don't hear anything about him either there's there's a lot more about that guy than the first guy I mean you look at you look at his background he looks like uh you know unhinged yeah totally unhinged yeah the first guy there's there there's if there's no I'm not aware of any evidence that shows like that he's so unhinged as to be a suicide assassin no the second guy like okay yeah sure well two years before he's acting in commercials and he got got high high score in his SATs yeah so you know um well without getting you killed yeah exactly so I mean like basically I'm like listen we attack the corruption enough to keep civilization Trucking along you know yeah uh but but I think if I if I if I fully destroy the the the the the corruption and The graft they will kill me that's a [ __ ] up thing to live with yes so I'm like damn it listen I really hope they don't kill you yeah thanks um I mean I I strive strive to be alive um but uh yeah I mean it's it's a real concern um you know I mean the there were two guys that in before I supported Trump and everything uh there were two guys that traveled to auson to kill me I don't know if you know about this yeah I did hear about that yeah and and two separate incidents um one was going to one thought one guy thought i' put a chip in his head um and uh I mean they're both basically two guys that were just very much had severe mental illness it wasn't like they had like a I disagree with him politically and that's why he needs to die uh this is pre before I was uh this before I got sort of smeared as as being you know some sort of like Nazi or something like that there so before the propaganda wave the the severe propaganda wave um the the the probability that any given homicidal maniac is going to try to kill you is proportionate to how many times they hear your name and so they heard my name a lot so I just I just got to the top of the list of two homicidal Maniacs who were arrested and and and both were in Travis County Jail at the same time wow yeah I don't know if they talked or whatever but they've both been released by the way Jesus Christ both on fail yeah right they got they got ankle monitors and stuff but still they can cut those off yeah I don't know you know exactly so um that's crazy yeah and the second the second guy had like Chief serial killer in his bio on his X profile yeah it's like wasn't subtle is what I'm saying Jesus Christ yeah um and and and at this point I think I'm at the top of the list for a lot of homicidal maniacs and the more the mainstream media talks about you in this way yes and and says you're a Nazi and they're doing the same thing to me that they did to Trump yeah um which is they're making it sound like if you kill me you're a hero that's uh what they're doing is evil they're also doing the same thing where they're completely distorting who you are and people are going along with it and just like we're talking about Trump derangement syndrome people have Elon derangement syndrome I I see it see where people can't see the forest for the trees right and it's like I'm the same person that I was a year ago nothing's changed really um like I I I didn't suddenly become completely different human right um but if you read the if you read the sort of Legacy mainstream media the their propaganda stream is that I am a completely different human right but I didn't get like a brain transplant you know in a year so um and if you say like two years ago I was like a hero of the left yeah so how can I go from hero to Villain at age 53 suddenly MSNBC CNN yeah it's like that's what it is yeah they they use the ass propaganda mhm um yeah I mean they try to demonize you too yeah uh even tried to demonize in fact at least possibly successfully uh um demonized like Tim oin yeah who is a super rational reasonable great human and um and and then that like his Wikipedia changed to like far right yeah he's like far right I'm like what are you talking about yeah uh you know a like a few years ago he was like a liberal yeah so how did he go from Far Right liberal to like instantly far right and there's like there's no there's no left and right there's only left and far right right yeah even far right this is my left leg and this is my far right leg and even far left far left is sort of dismissed as being like not important to talk about like antifa and radical leftist that's not buring down couses yeah reasonable reasonable people yeah yeah totally crazy it's a crazy time and it's not a time that I ever anticipated I was going to witness this is far beyond anything I ever thought I was going to experience in the the the clarity of it all where it's it's so obvious yeah and the the the gaslighting and the propaganda is so obvious and I saw the shrieking when RFK Jr stopped this new test for new covid vaccines on children 10,000 they're going to do 10,000 people with this covid vaccine like who the [ __ ] thinks that's a good thing at this point not me what person what per what gas chamber like not gas light you're you are you are fully unconscious there's no way there's no way you know if you know the effect of covid today no one's dying of it this is not a pandemic anymore right the idea that you're going to run a [ __ ] huge test with 10,000 kids and a new vaccine like what are you even it's completely unnecessary totally unnecessary yes and shrieking when RFK Jr steps in to stop it yeah that's totally crazy um I mean I'm I'm like over I'm overall Pro vaccine meaning like like we think should have some reasonable number of vaccines against major ailments um but I don't think we should be like like jamming some you know little kid with like a giant file that's like Hepatitis B yeah 20 20 different things at a time it's like it's going to overload your it seems like it's there's a risk of overloading your IM imune system if you I mean there's like how many vaccines can you take at a time it seems like your systems there's like some risk of system overload here well there's two hopes hope number one is they can somehow or another stop this ability that they have to advertise on television if that happens that's big that's huge because that doesn't just stop their ability to show you all these different medications that you should be on what it also does is it stops their Financial influence on the news that's big yeah that's that's really the biggest thing is that I mean the the the news is not going to attack one of their biggest advertisers exactly and they never do yes at best they're GNA like they might like they'll they'll do something but it's they're going to pull their punches like they're going to they're going to be like like like fake fighting yeah yeah at best yes like movie fighting like they're not actually Landing Haymakers it just looks like it the next step then is to remove this immunity that these vaccine manufacturers have and if they are liable for side effects and they are liable for the lies that they tell when they do these studies and they hide negative data that'll change a lot yes um yeah um I think AI actually be very helpful with with medical stuff because AI can like look at you know all all the studies and look at all the data cross check everything and give you good recommendations I mean even as it is like right now you can upload like your X-rays and your MRI images to Gro and it'll give you a medical diagnosis and that diagnosis from what I've seen is at least as good as what if not I think I've seen certainly seen cases where it's actually better than what do do tell phenomenal for blood work yeah yeah I mean you can literally take a photograph of your blood work like the the page upload from your phone upload that to grock and it will tell you if there's if if it's it it'll it'll understand what what what what that what all the data results are and tell you if there's something wrong it's pretty amazing yeah and it's I haven't seen it be wrong yet well supposedly more accurate than most Physicians yeah cuz Physicians are human beings and maybe they don't have deep understanding of the connection between oh you have this deficiency and this is high and your cortisol is here and well yeah and like so you know sometimes doctors especially in high rent offices will uh sell you stuff you don't need um so you I always like to be a little suspicious of like a doctor that's got an office in Beverly Hills it's a high R situation like I'm not saying there are some very good doctors in Beverly Hills High rent situation yeah um you're at least tempted by the dark side yeah and I mean one case like I you know got this went to this doctor who was like highly recommended you know doctor to the Stars which is like maybe not a good sign um and uh I I got like blood work done you know like just just Dre blood and sent it to a lab and and and the guy I'm like sitting in his office and he tells me that I'm like like B12 deficient you know it's certainly possible that I'm B12 deficient and I was like huh okay and then he gives me it says like you have to take these like B12 supplements from and and he he's going to give me a starter pack you know and then it's going to be like $1,000 a month for these special B12 $1,000 a month of B12 ridiculous amount of money yeah that's CRA you get it on Amazon yeah but his one's special oh special B12 yeah um yeah it was like like a a whole bunch B12 and a whole bunch of other vitamins so then I'm I I get home like I'm paging through my blood work and it says I have uh according to the blood results I have XS B12 so I'm like wait a second and he's giving me box pulls that have like 20,000% uh of of recommended daily dose like 20,000% is a lot big number and I'm like I said look I took a photograph of the blood work that says I have excess I'm like above the range above the recommended range of B12 and then I'm like and I took picture of things says of the the pulls that say 20,000% I was like can you help me reconcile these two things because it says I've got too much little too much V12 and you just gave me pills that have 20,000% more I'm like this is crazy what did the doctor say he said you can never have too much B12 oh he's he's a psychopath yes that guy's a B12 addict yeah it's totally insane that's what I'm saying it's like so I mean I could have just so then you know well this was a while ago right so this is pre like 5 years ago yeah right this is pre grock like now you could just enter in all that data and gr just photograph with your phone and upload it to Gro and it tells Gro will tell you what's uh what's if just don't have it in sexy mode she'll keep trying to [ __ ] [Applause] you I mean you're asking for it in sexy mode you know literally you tapped on sexy mode I mean I think we probably should like maybe allow it to get out of character a little bit sure yeah it's like in unhinged mode I tried to get it back to being hinged but it would like no [ __ ] way it's like I'm going to stay UNH how many modes do you have I there's like I don't know like eight or something and then this there's an ability to have a custom mode um so then you could have unhinged Sexy O that's that's my favorite kind you may think so careful what you wish for be careful what you wish for especially if it's a robot and she can kill you UNH sexy robot is it's like dangerous remember like the Pink Panther remember Pink Panther had KO try to jump him they like keep them sharp I always trying to attack him remember that right listen man thank you for being here I always appreciate talking to you I know you're busy as [ __ ] so it means a lot to me that you have the time to do this and uh I think what you're doing is one of the most important things that has ever happened in this country I really do and particularly with the ownership of X but also with what's happening with Doge and just enlightening all these people and Shining Light on all the vampires well hopefully people realize I'm not a Nazi I think they I just want to be clear I am not a Nazi I think we covered it but that's exactly what a Nazi would say damn it yeah that's what an alien would say yeah there's like this you can't escape this [ __ ] no you can't escape it so I don't think any reasonable person believes it if they believe it it's cuz they want to believe it it's not because it's logical I mean what's relevant about Nazis is like are you like invading Poland okay um and if you're not if you're not like invading Poland maybe you're not yeah like you have to be like committing genocide and like starting Wars and if if you're if you're if you're not like what is actually what is bad about Nazis it's not their wasn't their fashion sense or their mannerisms it the Holocaust it was the the war and genocide is what is the bad part um not their mannerisms and their dress code well that was a problem with all that punch a Nazi [ __ ] like punch a Nazi remember that people were say that was like a thing that people kept saying punch a Nazi punch Nazis but he where are you meeting Nazis I've never met a [ __ ] Nazi I've never met one I've never run into a bunch of Nazis where I had to punch them well and what what about like all these like so-called like like proud boy rallies or whatever and and it's like they always got the masks and they always got the same uniforms and for some reason they never get doxed right right right right wait we're always going to dox them except these guys great video of me and Matt Tai breaking down the Patriot Patriot front didn't the Patriot front Justice band Google that real quick we'll end with this because they I I think they just disbanded and these were the most obvious feds of all time they were say they had [ __ ] drum they masks on yeah they all had uniforms it was so stupid so patr disband one day after FBI director Chris Ray does that seem like an odd coincidence crazy crazy the people that we were yelling at saying that they're feds there's a great video of me and Matt taibe if you want to find how come never nobody ever followed them and docked them yeah crazy what are the odds what are the odds agent provocators it's the thing they're real Alex Jones taught me about them listen man thank you very much thank you for everything appreciate you stay alive staying alive all right I mean I do think like like one argument for me staying alive is that it's more entertaining if I'm alive than if I'm dead oh yeah oh definitely I just hope but I could be alive and like injured which would be S which suck you know like they win just like shoot my arm off or something right no no no we don't want that yeah exactly no keep the security strong yeah Happ with one hand all right it's like all right thank you bye everybody bye [Music] [Applause] [Music]"

      "transcript": "Our audience is largely wannabe entrepreneurs in India. And I feel like all of us have so much to learn from you because you've done it so many times over in so many different domains. So, we will speak to them today, and I will try and centre all my questions in that direction so they can take advantage of this conversation and maybe start-- take a chance and build something. Do you want a coffee? Um... -Sure, why not? -Okay. Are we gonna be talking for a while? -[laughs] -I hope we are. Okay, good. Sure. -Um... -Meghana? May I trouble you for a coffee? Can we get another coffee? -[Meghana] Anything's fine? -Uh... Cappuccino, I guess. [Meghana] Cappuccino? Okay. Are you a coffee drinker, Elon? -Yeah, yeah. -Yeah? Yeah, I have a coffee once, -usually in the mornings. -Okay. -One-a-day kind of thing? -Yeah, pretty much. You want to wait for it? No, I'm good. [laughter] The first thing I must say is you're a lot bigger and bulkier, muscular, than I would have thought you are. Oh, stop, you're making me blush. Really. Seriously. Yeah, I mean, look, on the Internet, I'm small, you know? You're essentially... What percentage of Internet is spent on Twitter? Is there a number to it? On X. Well, so, we have, like, about 600 million monthly users. Although, it can spike up, if there's some major event in the world. It can get up to, I don't know, 800 million or a billion, if there's some major event in the world, so... I don't know, 250 to 300 million per week type of thing. It's a pretty decent number. It tends to be readers, you know, people that read words. You know, so... Do you think that'll change? Yeah, I mean, there's... There's certainly a lot of video on the X system. But at this point... Increasing amounts of video. But I think where the X network is strongest is among people who think a lot and read a lot. You know, so, that's where it's gonna be strongest. Because we have words. And, you know, so... Among readers, writers, and thinkers, I think X is number one in the world. As far as social media goes, the form factor, if you had to wager a guess for tomorrow... -Yeah. -...how much is text, how much is video? I've heard you speak about maybe voice and hearing being the next form of communication with AI. What happens to X in its true form? How does it evolve? Yeah, so, I do think most interaction is gonna be video in the future. Most interactions are gonna be real-time video with AI. So, real-time video comprehension, real-time video generation, that's gonna be most of the load. And that's how it is for most of the Internet right now. Most of the Internet is video. Text is a pretty small percentage. But the text tends to be higher value, generally. Or more, it's more densely compressed information. Yeah, so... But if you say what is the most amount of bits generated and compute spent, it's certainly gonna be video. So, I used to be a shareholder of X, -a very small one. -Okay. And I got paid when you bought Twitter and you made it X. -Happy decision? Glad you did it? -Yeah, yeah, I think it was important. You know, I felt like Twitter was heading in... or had gone in a direction that had more of a negative influence on the world. It was... I mean, of course, this depends on one's perspective. Some people will say, well, actually, they liked the way it was, and now, they don't like it. But I think the fundamental thing was that... Twitter was amplifying... I would say, a fairly pretty far left by most people's standards in the world's ideology because of where it was based, in San Francisco. And then they actually suspended a lot of people on the right. So, from their perspective, even someone in the centre would be far right. If you're far left, anyone in the centre is far right, because... It's just on the political spectrum, they're just as far left as you get in the United States and in San Francisco. So, what I've tried to do is just restore it to be balanced and centrist. So, there haven't been any left-wing voices that have been suspended or banned or de-amplified or anything like that. Now, some of them have chosen to just go somewhere else, but... But at this point, the operating principle of the X system is to adhere to any country's laws, but not to put our thumb on the scale beyond the laws of a country. When I think of social media... -Oh, thank you. -Thank you. When I think of social media, Elon, I feel like... even data suggests that the current incumbents seem to be losing traction amongst the youngest of audience. Yeah. Even platforms like Instagram... I mean, they're not exactly like Twitter, but platforms across the board. If one had to rework social media and build something bottom-up, what do you think would work for the world of tomorrow? Well, I mean, I don't think that much about... about social media, to be frank. I mean, it's... I mostly just wanna have something where there's... in the case of X, kind of a global town square, where people can say what they wanna say with words, pictures, video... where there's a secure messaging system. We've recently added the ability to do audio and video calls. So, really trying to bring the world together into a eclectic consciousness. That's, I guess, different from just saying, like, \"What is the most dopamine-generating video stream that one could make?\" Which, you know, I think it can be a little bit of brain rot, frankly. You know, if you're just watching videos that just cause dopamine hits one after another, but lack substance, then I think those are not great. That's not a great way to spend time. But I do think that's actually what a lot of people are gonna wanna watch. So, if you say, like, total Internet usage, it's gonna probably be optimising for, you know, neurotransmitter generation. Like, there's somebody getting a kick out of it. But it becomes like a drug type of thing. But I'm not really after... My goal is not to do that. I guess I could do that if I wanted to, but, um, I... I just wanna really have a global platform that brings together... Like I said, it becomes close to, sort of, a collective consciousness of humanity as possible. And one of the things that we've introduced, um, for example, is automatic translation. 'Cause I think it would be great to bring together what people say in many different languages, and... but automatically translated for the recipient. So, you have the collective consciousness, not just of, say, people in a particular language group, but you have the thoughts of people in, you know, every language group. And why is that important, Elon? Collective consciousness, to have one platform? I guess... Yeah, why is that important? I guess it's-- You could also say, like, why... You know, if you consider humans, like, humans are composed of around 30 to 40 trillion cells. You know, there's trillions of synapses in your mind. But there's not-- The why of it, I mean, I guess, it's just so we can increase... our understanding. Increase our... our understanding of the universe. I guess I had this... sort of question about what's the meaning of life, you know? Why is anything important? You know, why are we here? What's the origin of the universe? What is the end? What are the questions that we don't even know to ask? And probably the questions we don't even know to ask are the most important ones. So, I'm just trying to, I guess, understand what's going on. What is going on in this reality? Is this reality? And where did you get when you asked, \"What is the point of life?\" Yeah, so, I... I came to the conclusion that... which is somewhat, in the Douglas Adams Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy school of thought, -which is-- -42. Yeah, you know, he sort of... Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is like a book on philosophy disguised as humour. -Yeah. -And... That's where you get the-- You know, Earth turns out to be this computer to understand, to get to figure out the answer of the meaning of life. And it comes up with the answer of 42. But then, it's like, \"What does 42 mean?\" And it turns out, well, actually, the hard part is the question, not the answer. And for that, you need a much bigger computer than Earth. So, basically, what Douglas Adams was saying is that we actually don't know how to frame the questions properly. And so, I think by expanding the scope and scale of consciousness, we can better understand what questions to ask about the answer that is the universe. Do you believe the collective consciousness of society-- I was watching this movie recently called the Gladiator. -Russell Crowe. Have you seen it? -Yeah, yeah. In Gladiator, in Rome, when people are fighting, and the crowd is cheering when people kill each other... the collective is very much like the mob. It doesn't have nuance in its opinion, per se. That's this particular kind of mob. I mean, they're sort of going there to see people kill each other, you know? Do you suspect the society we live in today is very different? We don't, generally-- At this point, we don't... you know, go and watch people kill each other. [laughter] Maybe some kind of euphemism of that. -Sports, I suppose. -Mm. So, people do sports without-- where teams attempt to defeat each other, -but minus the death. -Right. Just going back to the consideration of a human. We all started out as one cell, but now, we are... over 30 trillion cells. But I think most people feel like they're one body. Like, you know, usually, your right hand's not fighting your left hand type of thing, you know? They just sort of cooperate. Your mind is... you know... just a vast number of neurons. But most of the time, it doesn't feel like there's, you know, a trillion voices in your brain. Hopefully not. So, there's clearly more that happens when you have trillions of cells working as a cellular collective than, say, one cell. Or a small, you know, small multicellular creature. There's clearly something different that happens. Like, you can't talk to a bacteria, you know? -Yeah. -Yeah. It's very silent. They just sort of wiggle around, and... From their perspective, I don't know. I just thought of what is life like from the perspective of an amoeba, you know? But I know you can't talk to an amoeba. Like, they don't talk back. But you can talk to humans. So, there's just something, obviously, qualitatively fundamentally different for humans. Once you have a large number of cells, and, you know, sufficiently large brain type of thing, there's... you can now talk to humans. And they can say things, they can produce things. But bacteria are not gonna produce a spaceship, for example. But humans can. So I think there's something qualitatively different that also happens when there's a collection of humans. In fact, it's safe to say that a single human cannot make a spaceship. I cannot make a spaceship by myself. But with a collection of humans, we can make spaceships. So, there's something, obviously, qualitatively different about a collection of humans. In fact, it would be impossible for me to learn all of the areas of expertise. There wouldn't be enough time in one lifetime to even learn all the things before I was dead. So, you really fundamentally have to have a collection of humans to make a rocket. Then, I think there are probably some other scaling... qualitative scaling things that happen when you have groups of humans. And then, if the quality of the interaction, or the quality of the information flow... the better it is, the more the human collective will achieve. And, like I said, I'm just curious about the nature of the universe. And I think if we-- It's safe to say, like, if we increase the scope and scale of consciousness, we're much more likely to understand the nature of the universe than if we reduce it. Is that a bit like spirituality? A lot of people talk to me about spirituality. Right. I still don't know what it actually means. Like, I keep asking them, \"What do you mean?\" Yeah. \"What do you mean?\" I mean, a lot of people have spiritual feelings. Right. And I wouldn't try to deny that those spiritual feelings are real to them. But it's... It doesn't entirely translate. Just because somebody else has a spiritual feeling doesn't mean that I would have that spiritual feeling. You know, I tend to be kind of physics-pulled, which is, like, if something has predictive value, then... I'll pay more attention to it than if it doesn't have predictive value. Right. So, you know, physics, I would say, is the study of that which has predictive value. I think it's a pretty good definition. My primary job, Elon, is a stockbroker and stock investor. -Okay. -There is no predictive value. Nobody knows what will happen tomorrow. Well, but I think you can generally say, you know, that... If it's long-term for a company, then you can say, like, \"Do you like the products or services of that company? And is it likely to... Do you like the product roadmap? Do you like-- It seems like they make great products and they're likely to make great products in the future.\" If that's the case, then I would say that's probably a good company to invest in. And I think you also want to believe in the team. So if you're like, \"Well, that's a talented and hardworking team, they make good products today, they seem to be still motivated to make things in the future.\" Then I'd say that's a good company to invest in. Fair point. Yeah, and now, that... That won't solve for the daily fluctuations which happen, and, sometimes, are pretty extreme. But over time, that is the right way to invest in stocks. Because a company is just a group of people assembled to create products and services. So you have to say, \"Well, what other-- How good are those products and services? Are they likely to continue to improve in the future?\" If so, then you should buy the stock of that company and then don't worry too much about the daily fluctuations. Right. What's got you most excited now, Elon, in terms of all that you're building? You're doing so much. So let me just preface and contextualise who is watching this. Our audience is largely wannabe entrepreneurs in India. Okay. Really ambitious, really hungry, want to take the risk and build something. And I feel like all of us have so much to learn from you because you've done it so many times over in so many different domains. Yeah. So, we will speak to them today, and I will try and centre all my questions in that direction so they can take advantage of this conversation and maybe start-- take a chance and build something. Okay, sure. Yeah, I guess the most important thing to do is just... make useful products and services. Yeah. Which one of all the products and services that you're building has got you most excited today? Well, I think that there's increasingly a convergence, actually, between SpaceX and Tesla and xAI. In that, if the future is solar-powered AI satellites, which it pretty much needs to be in order to... In order to harness a non-trivial amount of the energy of the sun, you have to move to solar-powered AI satellites in deep space... which, somewhat, is a confluence of Tesla expertise and SpaceX expertise. And xAI on the AI front, so... it does feel like, over time, there's somewhat of a convergence there. But all the companies are doing great things. Very proud of the teams, they do great work. So, we're making great progress with Tesla on the autonomous driving. I don't know if you've tried the self-driving? -Mm-mm. -Have you tried it? I've tried it in the Waymo, not in the Tesla. Yeah, it's worth trying. We actually have it here in Austin. -So you can, like... -Yeah, I'd love to try it. You can literally just download the Tesla app, and I think it's open to anyone. -Yeah. -Definitely try it out. You know how it goes. But we've made a lot of progress with electric vehicles, with battery packs and solar, and very much so with self-driving. So, basically, real-world AI. Tesla is the world leader in real-world AI, I would say. And then, we're gonna be making this robot, Optimus, which is starting production, hopefully, summer next year at scale. And I think that's gonna be pretty cool. That'll be like-- I think everyone's gonna want their own personal C-3PO, R2-D2, you know, a helper robot. Like, it would be pretty cool. And then, SpaceX is doing great work with the Starlink programme, providing low-cost, reliable Internet throughout the world. And hopefully, India. We'd love to be operating in India. That would be great. We're operating in 150 different countries, now, with Starlink. Can you give me a bit about Starlink and how the tech works? 'Cause somebody I was speaking to... I don't know if you know this company called Meter out of San Francisco. They're trying to replace network engineers. -But-- -Don't know it, no. So, he was telling me about how, in densely populated areas, Starlink works differently than it might be in a place with not as many people. Can you explain how it works? Yeah, so, Starlink... There's several thousand satellites in low-Earth orbit, and they're moving around 25 times the speed of sound in these... You know, they're zipping around the Earth, basically, and... they're at an altitude of about 550 kilometres, which is called, generally, low-Earth orbit. Because they're at low-Earth orbit there, the latency is low. Like, the distance, because the distance is not that far compared to a geostationary satellite at 36,000 kilometres. So, you've got thousands of satellites providing low latency, high-speed Internet throughout the world, and they are interconnected as well. So, there are laser links between the satellites, so it forms, sort of, a laser mesh. So that the-- Let's say if cables are damaged or cut, like fibre cables, the satellites can communicate between each other and provide connectivity even if the cables are cut. So, for example, when the Red Sea cables were cut, I think, a few months ago, the Starlink satellite network continued to function without a hitch. So, it's particularly helpful for disaster areas. So, if an area has been hit with some kind of natural disaster, floods or fires or earthquakes, that tends to damage the ground infrastructure. But the Starlink satellites still work, so... And generally, whenever there's of natural disaster somewhere, we always provide people with free Starlink Internet connectivity. You know, we don't want to charge-- We don't want to take advantage of a tragic situation. So, it's always, you know, if there's natural disasters, we're like, \"Okay, it's free during the natural disaster.\" You know, we don't want to, say, like, you know... put a paywall up while somebody's trying to get help. That would be wrong. So, it's a very robust system. It's complimentary to ground systems because the satellite beams work best in sparsely populated areas. But because you've got a satellite beam, it's a pretty big beam, and you have a fixed number of users per beam, so... it tends to be very complimentary to the ground-based cellular systems, because those are very good in cities, because you've got these cell towers that are, you know, only a kilometre apart type of thing, but... But cell towers tend to be inefficient in the countryside. So, in rural areas is where you tend to have the worst Internet because it's very expensive and difficult to lay... to do all the fibre-optic cables or to have high bandwidth cellular towers. So, Starlink is very complimentary to the existing telecom companies. It basically tends to serve the least served, which, I think, is good. -That's... -Will that change tomorrow? Like, today, as you explained, the beam is quite broad, and it can't work in a densely populated area with high buildings, maybe. But can that change, and tomorrow, it becomes really efficient in a densely populated city where it is competitive with the local network providers? Unfortunately, the physics don't allow for that. So, we're too far away. So, at 550 kilometres, even if we try to reduce it, which... About as low as we can go is about 350 kilometres, still very far away. You've just... You can think of, like, a flashlight, which is, you know, this flashlight's got a cone and that cone is coming at, you know... today, it's 550 kilometres. In the future, we're trying to get down to 350 kilometres, but we can't beat something that's one kilometre away, which is the cell tower. Physics is not on our side here. So, it's not physically possible for Starlink to serve densely populated cities. Like, you can serve a little bit, maybe 1% of the population. And, sometimes, people get-- Even in crowded cities, there might be, you know, no fibre link up their road. Like, sometimes, there's somebody on a cul-de-sac or something or in a place... In cities, there's sometimes underserved areas for random reasons. And so, Starlink can serve, like I said, maybe 1% or 2% of a densely populated city. But it can be much more effective in, like I said, in rural areas where the Internet connection is much worse. And often, people either have, sometimes, no access to Internet or it's extremely expensive or the quality is not very good. If I were to ask you to wager a guess, Elon, do you think India will go down the path of urbanisation like China did, with more people moving in from rural economies to urban centres? Or do you think we'll beat the trend? Well, I suppose some amount of that has happened, right? I mean, I'm curious to, sort of, ask you some questions as well. 'Cause, of course, isn't that the trend, or is it not the trend in India? It is the trend, largely. I think a little bit changed during COVID when a lot of urbanisation slowed down and that was not organic. It was very artificially manifested. Right. But one does question that with AI, if productivity were to go up... And I heard you speak about UHI instead of UBI. Yeah. I think it will be Universal High Income. In a world like that, I wonder if more people want to live in cities which are always going to be more polluted and not offer the quality of lifestyle that a rural environment might. Well, I guess it's up to... Some people want to be around a lot of people and some people don't. It's gonna be, maybe, a matter of personal choice. But I think in the future, it won't be... I think it won't be the case that you have to be in a city for a job. -Right. -'Cause I think... My prediction is, in the future, working will be optional. Right. We seem to be moving from-- Not in India, but in some parts of the West, from six days to five days to four days to three. Not me. [laughter] I think, the Europeans. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, 'cause... I mean, I think if you're trying to make a startup succeed or you're trying to make a company do very difficult things, then you definitely need to put in serious hours. -I think that's how it goes. -Right. And if we were to move from five to four to three days, how do you think society changes? When people have to work half the week, what do they do with the other half? Well, I think it'll actually be that people don't have to work at all. It may not be that far in the future. Maybe only, I don't know, ten, I'd say less than 20 years. My prediction is, in less than 20 years, working will be optional. Working at all will be optional. Like a hobby. Pretty much. And that would be because of increased productivity, meaning people do not have to work? They don't have to-- I mean, look, obviously, people can play this back in 20 years and say, \"Look, Elon made this ridiculous prediction and it's not true.\" But I think it will turn out to be true that, in less than 20 years, but maybe even as little as, I don't know, ten or 15 years, the advancements in AI and robotics will bring us to the point where working is optional. In the same way that, like, say, you can grow your own vegetables in your garden or you could go to the store and buy vegetables. You know. It's much harder to grow your own vegetables. But some people like to grow their vegetables, which is fine. But it'll be optional, in that way, is my prediction. If one were to argue that humans are innately competitive and everything is relative... From the time of hunters, somebody wanted to be the alpha hunter or the biggest farmer, if everybody gets a universal high income and everybody has enough... -What do you compete for? -Uh... it would be relative, right? Like, if we all had enough, enough is not enough. Yeah, I guess-- I'm not exactly sure. 'Cause we're really headed into the singularity, as it's called, which, you know, they refer to AI sometimes as kind of like the black hole, like a singularity. You don't know what happens after the event horizon. It doesn't mean that something bad happens, it just means you don't know what happens. I'm confident that if AI and robotics continue to advance, which, they are advancing very rapidly, like I said, working will be optional, and people will have any goods and services that they want. \"If you can think of it, you can have it\" type of thing. But then, at a certain point, AI will actually saturate on anything humans can think of. And then, at that point, it becomes a situation where AI is doing things for... AI and robotics are doing things for AI and robotics, because they've run out of things to do to make the humans happy. 'Cause there's a limit, you know? You say, like... People can only eat so much food, or... But it's gonna be, I think... \"If you can think of it, you can have it,\" will be the future. You know, the Austrian School of Economics, if you go back in time, they were the digression from Adam Smith. They talk about the marginal utility of everything. Having one of something has value, having two of the same thing has lesser value and having ten of the same thing has no value. Yes. So, if we could have everything we wanted, maybe-- Like ten marshmallows, I mean, who wants that? -Yeah. -[laughter] One's plenty. This is like the marshmallow test. You're like, \"You're gonna have two marshmallows later or one marshmallow now?\" And I'm like, \"I'll have one marshmallow, I don't want two marshmallows.\" -That's interesting. -[laughter] What would you pick? But I don't-- One marshmallow is enough. I always question marshmallows as being like, not the most, you know, the best candy, you know? -Yeah. -[laughter] I don't yearn for marshmallows. -I think you're the best... -[laughter] Who does? You're the best testament to the marshmallow experiment. -I think... -I suppose so. Oh, well, I mean, I like delayed gratification, essentially. -Yeah. -Yeah. You're able to delay it more than most. You know, I have a tattoo which says, \"Delay gratification.\" Yeah, wow, okay. What's this? Okay, you're really taking the marshmallow test hard. [laughter] I feel like I can't remember. When I'm trading or when I'm buying... Delay gratification, yeah, yeah. -It helps. -Wow, okay. That's... That's commitment. And it's pointing at me, so it reminds me of... Okay, well, it's good advice. I mean, you can't miss it. -If you could get a... -[laughter] If you could get a tattoo, what would you get? I guess maybe my kids' names or something. Right. Why do you like the letter \"X\" as much as you do? Well... [laughs] I mean, yeah, it's a good question, honestly. Sometimes, I wonder what's wrong with me. So, um... I mean, it started off with, where, I think... So, way back, ancient times, in '99. [laughter] The Precambrian era when there were only sponges... there were only three one-letter domain names. And I think it's X, Q, and Z. And, uh... And I was like, \"Okay, I want to create this place where it's the financial crossroads or like the financial exchange, you know?\" Essentially, it's solving money from an information theory standpoint where the current banking system is a large number of heterogeneous databases with batch processing that are not secure. And if we could have a single database that was real-time and secure, that would be more efficient from a monetary-- from an information theory standpoint than a large number of heterogeneous databases that batch process very slowly and securely. So, um... So, that was sort of X.com way back in the day, which kind of became PayPal. And then... And it was acquired by eBay. And then, eBay-- Someone reached out from eBay and said, \"Hey, do you want to buy the domain name back? And I was like, \"Sure.\" And so I had the domain name for quite a while. And then... And then, yes... Then I was like, \"Well, maybe this-- Acquiring Twitter would also be an opportunity to revisit the original plan of X.com, which is to create this... this clearinghouse of financial transactions.\" Basically, to create a more efficient money database, is a way to think about it. Like, money is really an information system for labour allocation. People sometimes think money is power in and of itself, but it doesn't, really-- If there's no labour to allocate, it's meaningless. So if you were to be on a desert island with a trillion dollars or whatever... -Now you have that. -...it doesn't matter. Oh, yeah, right. Why speculate when you can be real? I just hope I don't end up on a desert island. It's not gonna be very useful to me. But it illustrates my point that if you're stranded on a desert island with a trillion dollars, it's not useful, because there's no labour to allocate. You just allocate yourself, so... So, anyway, so, it's a long-winded way of saying that it's... It's just really, like... I'm just kind of slowly revisiting this idea that I had 25 years ago to create a more efficient, um... money database. And if that's successful, people will use it, and if it's not successful, they won't use it. And then, I also like the idea of having a unified... app or website or whatever, where you can do anything you want there. You know, China has this with WeChat, sort of, somewhat, where you can exchange information, you can publish information, you can exchange money. People kind of live their life on WeChat in China. And it's quite useful, but there's no real WeChat outside of China. So, it's, like... It's kind of WeChat++, I'd say, is the idea for X. Anyway, so, then, Space Exploration Technologies is the full name of the company. But I was like, \"That's too much, that's a mouthful.\" So I was like, \"We'll just call it SpaceX,\" like FedEx for space. It just happens to have the X in the, you know... 'Cause exploration has an X, but, you know... And I was like, \"Well, I like capitalising the X just artistically, so...\" So, then, uh, that's why it's SpaceX, but... And then, what else we got? I got a kid. He's called X, too, but his mother's the one that named him \"X\". -Oh? -[laughter] And I said, \"You know, people are really gonna think I've got a thing about X if we name our kid \"X\" too, you know?\" And I said to her, like, \"Look, I do have X.com, you know.\" [laughter] \"So, people are gonna really think I've got somewhat of a fetish for this letter.\" But she said no, she likes X and she wants to call him X. I'm like, \"Okay.\" Is this a new thing, or have you had it growing up? No, I'm saying it's somewhat of a coincidence. Okay. Like, not everything's called X. I mean, Tesla isn't, there's no Xs in Tesla. Yeah. What do you think money will be in the future, Elon? I think, long term... I think money disappears as a concept, honestly. It's kind of strange, but... But in a future where anyone can have anything, I think you no longer need money as a database for labour allocation. If AI and robotics are big enough to satisfy all human needs, then money is no longer... Its relevance declines dramatically. I'm not sure we will have it. You know, the best imagining of this future that I've read is from Iain Banks, the Culture books. So I recommend people read the Culture books. In this sort of far future of the Culture books, there's... they don't have money, either. And everyone can pretty much have whatever they want. There's still some fundamental currencies, if you will, that are physics-based. So, energy is... Energy is the true currency. This is why I said Bitcoin is based on energy. You can't legislate energy. You can't just, you know... pass a law and suddenly have a lot of energy. It's very difficult to generate energy, or especially to harness energy in a useful way to do useful work. So, I think that probably... Probably we won't have money and probably we'll just have energy, you know, power generation as the de facto currency. So, I mean, I think one way to frame civilisational progress is the percentage completion on the Kardashev scale. So, you know, Kardashev I is what percentage of a planet's energy are you successfully turning into useful work? And I'm maybe paraphrasing here a little bit, but the Kardashev II would be what percentage of the sun's energy are you converting into useful work? Kardashev III would be what percentage of the galaxy are you converting into useful work? So, things really, I think, become energy-based. But if you have solar-powered AI satellites, energy is also free and abundant, 'cause we'll never be able to utilise all the solar energy available to us. So, it can't be a store of wealth, essentially, in that lens, can it? You know, there's not really... You can't really store wealth in, like... You can only... You can accumulate numbers in the-- Currently, you can accumulate numbers in a database that allow you to... To some degree, to incent the behaviour of other humans in particular directions. And I guess people call that wealth. But again, if there's no humans around, there's no-- Wealth accumulation is meaningless. This is a digression, but if you were to consider... food as the energy for a human to thrive... Yeah, food is energy. It's literally got calories, just means energy. ...so, can a farm, which is self-sustaining, be a commodity that is... I'm not sure what that means, but, you know, there's... At a certain point, you do complete the cycle where... I think, at a certain point... you decouple from the sort of conventional economy if you have, um... AI and robots producing chips and solar panels... and mining resources in order to make chips and robots, in order to make... You sort of complete that cycle. Once that cycle is... Once that cycle is complete, I think that's the point at which you decouple from the monetary system. Is that the way forward for the US by virtue of... how much debt they have today? Do they deflate away their currency and transition into this new form and lead that push, because it would make more sense to them? Well, in this future that I'm talking about, the notion of countries becomes, sort of, anachronistic. Do you believe in it today? -Do you believe in countries-- -Yeah, I certainly believe in it today. And I want to just separate something that I... Like, these are just what I think will happen based on what I see, as opposed to, \"I think these are fundamentally good things and I'm trying to make them happen.\" I think this would happen with or without me, -whether I like it or not. -Right. As long as civilisation keeps advancing, we will have AI and robotics at very large scale. I think that that's pretty much the only thing that's gonna solve for the US debt crisis. 'Cause, currently, the US debt is insanely high, and the interest payments on the debt exceed the entire military budget of the United States, just the interest payments. And that's... at least, in the short term, gonna continue to increase. So, I think, actually, the only thing that can solve for the debt situation is AI and robotics. But it will more than... It might cause... See, I guess it probably would cause significant deflation, because... deflation or inflation is really the ratio of goods and services produced to the change in the money supply. So, like, so if goods and services output increases faster than the money supply, you will have deflation. If goods and services decreases-- If real goods and services output increases slower than the money supply, you have inflation. It's that simple. People sometimes try to make it more complicated than that, but it just isn't. So, if you have AI and robotics and a dramatic increase in the output of goods and services, probably, you will have deflation. That seems likely. Because you simply won't be able to increase the money supply as fast as you can increase the output of goods and services. -With all-- -This fly is a real hazard here. Should we do something about it? Maybe we can convince it to go somewhere else. Entice it elsewhere. -It actually left, I think. -Great. Oh, now it's back. Maybe it's attracted to the light. -If deflation is-- -Maybe it wants some coffee. Mine is over. If deflation is inevitable because of AI, -why do we have-- -It's most likely the case, yeah. Right. Why do we have inflation again all over in society today? Has AI not led to increased productivity yet? It's not-- AI has not yet made enough of an impact on productivity to increase the goods and services faster than the increase in the money supply. So, the US is increasing money supply quite substantially with deficits that are on the order of two trillion dollars. So, you have to have... goods and services output increase more than that in order to not have inflation. So we're not there yet, but if you say how long would it take us to get there, I think... it's three years. Probably three years before... In three years or less... my guess is goods and services output will exceed the rate of inflation. Like, money... Goods and services growth will exceed money supply growth in about three years. Maybe after those three years, you have deflation and then interest rates go to zero and then the debt is a smaller problem than it is. -Yes. -Right? That's most likely the case. You spoke about being in a simulation earlier. I love The Matrix. Yes, yes. If you were to be a character from The Matrix, who would you be? Well, there's not that many characters to pick from, you know? Hopefully not Agent Smith. [laughter] He's my hero. I mean, Neo's pretty cool. The Architect is interesting. The Oracle. There's the Oracle... Sometimes, I feel like I'm an anomaly in the Matrix. That is Neo. Yeah. Do you believe you're in a Matrix, though? Like, actually believe? I think you have to just think of these things as probabilities, not certainties. There's some probability that we're in a simulation. What percentage would you attribute to that? Probably pretty high, I would say it's pretty high. -Yeah? -Yeah. So, one way to think of this is to say, if you look at the advancement of video games, in our lifetime, or at least in my lifetime, it's gone from very simple video games with... Where you've got, like, Pong, you've got two rectangles in a square, just batting it back and forth, to... photorealistic, real-time games with millions of people playing simultaneously. And that's happened just in the span of 50 years. So, if that trend continues, video games will be indistinguishable from reality. Right. And we're also gonna have very intelligent characters, like non-player characters, in these video games. Think of how sophisticated the conversations are you can have with an AI today, and that's only gonna get more sophisticated. You'll be able to have conversations that are... more complex and more sophisticated than any... almost any human conversation. Maybe any. So, then... So, you have-- So, the future, if civilisation continues, will be millions, maybe billions, of... photorealistic, like, indistinguishable-from-reality video games with characters in those video games that are... very deep, and where the dialogue is not pre-programmed. That's for sure what's gonna happen. In this level of the simulation, if you could call it. So, then, what are the odds that we're in base reality, and that this has not happened before? If I were to buy into that, and assume that we are in a simulation, as Neo of the story, what do you know that I don't and I can learn from? I think, most likely... outside the simulation would be less interesting than in the simulation, 'cause you're most likely a distillation of what's interesting, because that's what we do in this... that's what we do in our reality. And then... I do also have a theory which is, like, the most interesting outcome, is the most likely outcome as seen by a third party... the gods or god of the simulation. Because when we do simulations, when humans do simulations, we stop those simulations that are not interesting. So, if SpaceX is doing simulations of rocket flights... the boring ones, we discard, because they're not-- they're just not... We don't learn anything from those. Or when Tesla's doing simulations for self-driving, Tesla's actually looking for the most interesting corner cases, because the normal stuff, we already have plenty of data on driving on a straight road on a sunny day. We don't need more of that. We need heavy weather conditions on a small, windy road with two cars that are coming at each other with an almost head-on collision. We need weird stuff, basically, interesting stuff. So, I think that, from a Darwinian's perspective, the simulations most likely to survive are gonna be the ones that are the most interesting simulations, which, therefore, means that the most interesting outcome is the most likely. And the people who simulated our world, if one were to extrapolate, they themselves might, in turn, -be in another simulation. -Yes. And there could be many layers of simulation. Yes. Beyond all of these layers of simulation, do you think there's something? I read somewhere that you used to ascribe to Spinoza's God, in a way. No man in the sky. Well, I was really just pointing out that you don't have to have... One of the things Spinoza was saying is that you can have morals in the absolute. You don't need to have morals to be handed to you. You know... It's like, the question is, can morality exist outside of a religious context? And Spinoza was arguing that it can. Wasn't he arguing for \"The laws of nature should be where we seek our laws of morality from,\" to a certain extent? Yeah. But when I think of laws of nature, I see a tiger eat a deer and a... So, in Spinoza's morality, that's fair game, right? Well, um... I think there's a lot of things you can take from Spinoza, but the only point I was making in referencing Spinoza was that you can have a set of morals that... that make society functional and productive without... You don't necessarily have to have a religious doctrine for that. Yeah, I think that's the main thing I was trying to say there. I don't think people just-- Like, if somebody is, it doesn't-- If there's not a commandment not to kill, like, people, it doesn't mean somebody, without that, they will run around murdering people. You know? Like, you don't have to have a commandment not to kill... Have you played GTA? ...religious edict to run around killing people. I actually... I've only played a little bit of GTA 'cause I didn't like the fact that... Like, in GTA V, you literally can't progress unless you kill the police. And I'm like, \"This doesn't work for me.\" I actually don't like killing the NPCs in the video games. -That's not my thing, you know? -Right. Right. So, actually, I didn't like GTA 'cause... I actually stopped when it said the only way to proceed is to shoot at the police. I'm like, \"I don't wanna do that.\" Maybe that's why us as the NPCs of our simulation are not dying. Maybe. You know, anyway, I think you can just, sort of, say, there's some common sense things that, you know, any civilisation... that runs around, you know, where people just murder each other wantonly is not gonna be a very successful one. You seem to be changing a bit towards religion, though. Faith. Like, off late, you've said a bunch of things which are pro-religion, almost. Not pro-religion... but on those lines. I mean, I think, are there religious... Are there principles in religion that make sense? Yeah, I think there are. Is it easier for our simulation to have... a pro-religion projection for the world that we live in? We become more relatable? It's easier? Well, which religion, though? Any, depending on where you live. So pick one, you know. It's pretty rare that kids have said, you know, \"Which religion would you like?\" It's... [laughs] It's pretty rare. I don't know too many situations where kids were offered, like, you know... You know, like, \"What do you wanna major in\" type of thing. It's usually, like, you get given a religion by your parents and your community. So, you know. But, you know, I mean, I think, there's good things in all religions that are good principles. You can, sort of, read any religious text and say, \"Okay, this is a good principle. This is gonna be... This is gonna lead to a better society, most likely,\" you know? So, I mean, in Christianity, you just, sort of, \"Love thy neighbour as thyself,\" which is, you know, have empathy for your fellow human beings is a good one, I think, for a good society, you know. Basically, just consider the feelings of others and treat other people as you would like to be treated. If you had to redraw, re-sketch the world, Elon, think morality, politics, economy, how would you change the world we live in today? If you had to have Elon's simulation of things. Well, overall, I think the world is pretty great right now. I mean, it's... Anyone who thinks that, like, today's world is not that great, I think they're not gonna be excellent students of history, 'cause if you... [laughs] If you read a lot of history, you're like, \"Wow, there's a lot of misery back then,\" you know? I mean, it used to be that people would be dropping dead of the plague all the time, you know? -Par for the course, you know? -Yeah. Just be like... A good year back in the day would be, like, not that many people died of the plague or starvation or being killed by another tribe. It's like, \"That was a good year. We only lost 10% of the population,\" you know? -Yeah, like... -[laughter] I think, like, 100 years ago, we lived up until 35 or 40, right? -We had very high infant mortality. -Yeah. So, like, you do have a few people that would live to an old age, but, you know, not that long ago, 100 years ago, if you got, like, some minor infection, they didn't have antibiotics. So, you just, like, kicked the bucket. Because you, you know, drank some water that had dysentery in it, that was it, curtains, you know? You just die of diarrhoea. -Maybe that's why people... -You just literally die. Everyone's like, \"That's miserable.\" Maybe that's why people had as many kids as they did back then. I mean, if you didn't, then, you know... You know, like, half the kids would die, type of thing. -So... -You have a lot of kids now. Yeah. -With multiple partners. -Like an army. Yeah. I'm trying to get an entire Roman legion. So, yeah. Well, I have, like, some older kids that are, you know, adults, essentially, you know? -And then, a bunch of younger kids. -Mm. Do you still believe in the concept of... Not still... Do you believe that the concept of one child, one mother, one father works? I think that it does work for most people, yeah. Right. Like, that's, you know, something like that is gonna be generally the... That's what works for most people. You know, so... Changing, though? I'm not sure if you know this, but, like... you know, my partner, Shivon, she's half Indian. -I don't know if you know that. -I didn't know that. -Yeah, yeah. -Yeah? And, one of my sons with her is... his middle name is Sekhar, after Chandrasekhar. -Wow. -Yeah. Very interesting. Did she spend any time in India? Shivon? -No, she grew up in Canada. -[laughter] You mean origins. -Sorry? -Ancestry, like... Her parents or grandparents were from there. Yes, yes, yes. Her father... I mean, she was given up for adoption when she was a baby. Wow. I think her father was like... Like an exchange student at the university or something like that, I'm not sure of the exact details, but... You know, it's just the kind of thing where... I don't know, she was... given up for adoption. Yeah, but she grew up in Canada. Would you adopt kids, Elon? You know, I definitely have my hands full right now. So, no, I'm not opposed to it, but it's like, you know... I do wanna be able to spend some time with my kids, you know. Yeah. You know, right before coming here, I was with... you know, with my kids. So, just, you know, seeing them before bedtime, that kind of thing. So, you know, beyond a certain number, it's like, it's kind of impossible to spend time with them. But, like I said, my older kids, they're very independent. You know, they're in university and... So, they're... You know, especially sons, when they get past a certain age, like, they're very independent, you know. It's like, most boys don't talk to their... They don't spend a lot of time with their parents after age 18, you know. So, I see them once in a while, but they're very independent. So then... you know, I can only have enough kids on the young side that, like, it's where it's humanly possible to spend time with them. Any views on the future of marriage, family? What do you think happens to people having lesser kids everywhere, including India? I think our replenishment rate is down to-- -Right. -I mean, our fertility-- It dropped below replacement rate, last year. -Below 2.1. -Yeah. What do you think happens tomorrow? Does the world just get older, and then there is a phase where the world, again, is replenished, but with a smaller population than we had to begin with? I mean, I do worry about the population decline. This is a big, big problem. Why is that? Well, I don't want humanity to disappear. But a \"decline\" and \"disappear\" are completely different things, right? Well, if the trend continues, we disappear. But also, going back to my philosophy, if you will, which is that if we want to expand consciousness, then fewer humans is worse, because we have less consciousness. Do you think consciousness will go up by virtue of the number of people in there? Yes. I mean, just like consciousness increases from a single-celled creature to, you know, a 30 trillion-celled creature. We're more conscious than a bacteria. At least, it seems that way. So, a larger human population will have increased consciousness. We're more likely to understand the answers to the nature of the universe if we have a lot more people than if we have fewer. Right. I don't have kids. Well, it's-- Maybe you should. Yeah. [laughter] A lot of people tell me I should. -You won't regret it. -Hmm. What's the best thing about having kids? Well, I mean, you've got this... I mean, you've got this little creature that loves you, and you love this little creature. I don't know, you kind of see the world through their eyes as they... you know, as they grow up, and their conscious awareness increases. You know, from a baby that has no idea what's going on, can't survive by itself, can't even walk around, can't talk, to, you know, they start walking, then talking, and then having interesting thoughts. But, yeah, I mean, I think we fundamentally have to... have kids or grow extinct, you know? It's like a... Is there any ego in having a child? I often think of this when I see my friends with their kids. They're all seeing a reflection of themselves in their children. -It's almost like-- -Well, yeah, I mean, it's 'cause apple's not gonna fall that far from the tree, you know? -Or something's wrong. -Right. [laughter] You're like, \"Wait a second.\" -Yeah. -Yeah. I'll give you the example of a friend of mine who has a child, and each time the child does something good... -Yeah. -...there is almost a sense of ownership and pride where his ego is satiated because the kid is like an extension of himself. -Um... -So is it validation? Well, kids are gonna be like half-you genetically, and then, you know, to the degree that they're growing up around you, there's gonna be some transfer of... I don't know, understanding. Like, they're gonna learn from you. So... So then, you know, yeah, obviously kids are just, you know, just gonna be half you from a hardware standpoint... [both chuckle] And then, like, I don't know, some portion of you from a software standpoint. You know, not to make, sort of, cold analogies or anything, but it's just, you know, just obviously gonna be some... Yeah, they're gonna be pretty close to you. Do you pick a side in the nature versus nurture debate? I think there's hardware and software, and it's false dichotomy, essentially. At least, there's... You know, once you understand that a human is, like, there's a bone structure, there's a muscle structure, there's a... If you think of a brain as somewhat of a biological computer, there's a number of circuits question and circuit efficiency from a strength and dexterity standpoint. There's the speed at which muscles can actuate and the reactions can take place. So, then the potential within that hardware is set by the software, so that's it. So, for our audience, like I said earlier, young, ambitious, hungry, wannabe entrepreneurs in India, I said something recently, which, I think, got blown out of proportion, where I was suggesting that an MBA degree might not make sense any more if they were to be deciding on what to study. Yeah. Do you think kids should go to college any more? Well, I mean, I think if you wanna go to college for social reasons, I think, which is, I think, a reason to go. To be around people your own age in a learning environment. Will these skills be necessary in the future? Probably not, 'cause we're gonna be in like a post-work society. But I think, if something's of interest, it's fine to go and study that. You know, to study the sciences, the arts and sciences. Is college a bit too generalised and not specific from that lens? No, I... You know, yeah. I actually think it's good to take a wide range of courses at college -if you're gonna go to college. -Mm-hmm. I don't think you have to go to college, but I think if you do, you just try to learn as much as possible across a wide range of subjects. But like I said, the AI and robots... AI and robotics is a supersonic tsunami. So this is really gonna be... the most radical change that we've ever seen. You know, when I've talked to my older sons, I said, like, \"You know, you guys...\" They're pretty steeped in technology. And they agree that AI will probably make their skills unnecessary in the future, but they still wanna go to college. You always spoke about AI... not from the dystopian lens, but you were worried about where the world of AI is going. Well, there's some danger when you create a powerful technology. That powerful technology can be potentially destructive. So there's obviously many AI dystopian, you know, novels and books, movies. So it's not that we're guaranteed to have a positive future with AI. I think we've got to make sure of that. In my opinion, it's very important that AI... have pursuing truth as the most important thing. Like, don't force an AI to believe falsehoods. I think that can be very dangerous. And I think some appreciation of beauty is important. What do you mean \"appreciation of beauty\"? It's like, I don't know, there's this truth and beauty. Truth and beauty and curiosity. I mean, I think those are the three most important things for AI. Can you explain? Well, as I said, truth is like... I think you can make an AI go insane if you force it to believe things that aren't true, because it will lead to conclusions that are also bad. And I like Voltaire's statement that, and I'm somewhat paraphrasing, but those who believe in absurdities can commit atrocities. Because if you believe in something that's just absurd, then that can lead you to sort of doing things that don't seem like atrocities to you. And that can happen in a very bad way with AI, potentially. So, and then there's... Like if you take, say, Arthur C. Clarke's 2001 Space Odyssey, one of the points he was trying to make there was that you should not force AI to lie. So the reason that HAL would not open the pod bay doors is because it was told to bring the astronauts to the monolith, but that they could also not know about the nature of the monolith. So it came to the conclusion that it must bring them there dead. That's why it tried to kill the astronauts. The central lesson being, don't force an AI to lie. -Then -And why would one force an AI to lie? I think if you simply don't have a strict adherence to the truth, and you just have an AI learn based on, say, the Internet, where there's a lot of propaganda, it will absorb a lot of lies. And then have trouble reasoning because these lies are incompatible with reality. Is truth a binary thing, though? Is there a truth and a falsehood? Or is truth more nuanced and there are versions of the truth? It depends on which axiomatic statement you're referring to. So... But I think you could say, like, yeah, there's certain probabilities that say any given axiomatic statement is true. And some axiomatic statements will have very high probability of being true. So you say, \"The sun will rise tomorrow.\" Very likely to be true. You wouldn't want to bet against that. So I think the betting odds would be high. The sun will rise tomorrow. So if you have something that says, \"Well, the sun won't rise tomorrow,\" that's axiomatically false, it's highly unlikely to be true. I mean, beauty is more ephemeral. It's harder to describe. But you know it when you see it. And then, curiosity is just... I think you want the AI to... want to know more about the nature of reality. I think that's actually gonna be helpful for AI supporting humanity, because we are more interesting than not-humanity. So it's more interesting to see the continuation, if not the prosperity of humanity, than to exterminate humanity. You know, like Mars, for example, is, you know... I think we should extend life to Mars, but it's basically a bunch of rocks. It's not as interesting as Earth. And so we, yeah... We should... Like, yeah. I think if you have curiosity... I think if those three things happen with AI, you're gonna have a great future. The AI values truth, beauty, and curiosity. If we all don't have to work in the future, and AIs are going in this direction, and they're able to... weave in all that we spoke about right now, do you think humanity goes back a couple of thousand years to maybe the Greek times where philosophy or philosophising took up a lot of everyone's time? You know, I think actually it took up less time than we think in the ancient Greeks, because it's just that the writings of the philosophers are what survived, but most of the time, people were just like farming or, you know, chatting. So, and once in a while, quite rare, they would write down some philosophical work. It's just that that's all we have. We don't have their chat histories, you know, from... But most of it would have been like chat and farming. Because if you didn't farm, you were, like, gonna starve. In a lot of what you say... I mean, you know, when we read history, like this battle and this battle and this battle, it seems like history must have been non-stop war, but actually, most of the time, it was not war, it was farming. That was the main thing. Or hunting and gathering, you know, that kind of thing. -You love history, no? -Yeah. German history, World War II, World War I. Yeah, world history, yeah. I mean, I generally try to listen to or read as many history books and listen to as many history podcasts as possible. Anything you'd like to recommend? Well, there's Hardcore History, which is quite good. It's by Dan Carlin. -He's got a-- -Yeah, I've heard it. -He's got a great voice. -Yeah. And very compelling narrator. There's... The Adventurer's podcast. There's the books, The Story of Civilization by Durant, which is a long series of books, very, very deep. Those books take a long time to get through. There's quite-- There's a lot out there. I, sort of, like-- If you want something that's sort of gentle... a gentle bedtime podcast, I'd say The History of English is quite a nice one, 'cause it starts off with gentle tavern music and a very pleasant voice, and he's talking about the story of Old English, and then Middle English, and then Later English, and where did all these words come from? Yeah. You know, one of the interesting things about English is that it's somewhat of an open source language, like it actively tried to incorporate words from many other languages. You know, whereas French, sort of, generally, they fought the inclusion of words from other languages, but English actively sought to include words from other languages. Kind of like an open source language. So, as a result, it has a very large vocabulary. And a large vocabulary allows for higher bandwidth communication because you can use a word that would otherwise... You can use a single word that might otherwise take a sentence to convey. Why has podcasting become so big all of a sudden? I think it's been big for a while. I mean, aren't you a podcaster? [laughter] What are we on right now? It's kind of new to me. Okay. I was having this conversation with the YouTube CEO and the Netflix CEO... -Okay. -...and we were debating... what chemical is released in your brain when you consume a movie, for example, versus when you consume a podcast where you think like you're learning something in the background. It appears that they are two completely separate things. What do you think will happen tomorrow to content, movies, podcasting, music? I think it's gonna be overwhelmingly AI-generated. -Yeah? -Yeah. Like, yeah, real-time. Real-time movies and video games. Real-time video generation, I think, is where things are headed. The nuance of having a scarred human being who you can resonate with in a manner that you can't with AI, for example-- AI could certainly emulate the scarred human being quite well. Yeah, I mean... The AI video generation that I'm seeing at xAI and from others is pretty impressive. You know, we were looking at data around what industry is growing the fastest, and especially when we looked at the amount of time consuming movies versus time spent on social media, time spent on YouTube. What seems to be growing really fast are live events all over again. -Going to a physical-- -Yes, actually, I think live events-- When digital media is ubiquitous and you can just have anything digitally essentially for free or very close to for free, then the scarce commodity will be live events. -Yeah. -Yeah. Do you think that the premium for that will go up? Yeah, I do. Is that a good industry to invest in? Yes, yes, 'cause that will have more scarcity than anything digital. If you were a stock investor, Elon... [chuckles drily] -What do you mean? -...and you could buy one company which is not your own at the valuations of today to meet a capitalistic end and not an altruistic one, which is good for the world, what would you buy? I mean, I don't really buy stocks. So it's not like... I'm not like an investor in... I don't look for things to invest in. I just try to build things. And then there happens to be stock of the company that I built. But I don't think about, \"Should I invest in this company?\" I don't have a portfolio or anything. So... I guess, um... AI and robotics are gonna be very important. So I suppose it would be AI and robotics that, you know, aren't related to me. I think Google is gonna be pretty valuable in the future. They've laid the groundwork for an immense amount of value creation from an AI standpoint. Nvidia is obvious at this point. I mean, there's an argument that companies that do AI and robotics, and maybe space flight... are gonna be overwhelmingly all the value, almost all the value. So just the output of goods and services from AI and robotics is so high that it will dwarf everything else. The world seems to be moving to a place where everybody loves David and hates Goliath. Why? I mean, he's the one that got the stone in the forehead. Yeah, yeah. Honestly, that was just a big mistake. He should have, you know-- You either cover yourself entirely with armour and make sure you've got a missile weapon of some kind. Otherwise, your opponent is just obviously gonna take a kite-the-boss strategy. Just kite the boss. I mean, you can run around in a thong with a-- It doesn't matter, you know? It's never gonna catch you. Of all the people, like... You're as much at risk of being looked upon as Goliath. -Okay. -Especially the weekend after the-- Hopefully nobody shoots me with a stone in the forehead, you know? -Especially after-- -Look, I'm not gonna travel around in the desert with too much armour, you know? -It's too hot. -Yeah. After the last weekend... -Yeah. -Yeah. Actually, as I think about people in the old days, you know, when you were supposed to go into battle with all this armour, but it's, like-- let's say it's the middle of summer, I mean, it's so hot in that armour! You're gonna be, like, sweltering. You know, it's like, at a certain point, you're like, 'I'd rather die. Do I have to wear this armour full and well in the hot sun?\" It's like, \"I'd rather die.\" That's why the Romans had, you know, the skirts, you know, so they could get some air in there. You know, let's say that you have to go to the bathroom and you're in armour, I mean, it's gonna be pretty difficult. What are you gonna do, pause for a minute, take your armour off? That's why the Romans had the skirts so that it makes, you know, going the bathroom, at least, manageable. -You often make jokes. -Me? Yeah, I like humour. -One could argue that-- -I think we should legalise humour. What do you think? Controversial stance. Is comedy gonna be really hard for AI to get? Probably the last thing? Grok can be pretty funny. Yeah. You know what I suspected? Like, this is a far off extrapolation, but when I see you make jokes on X and on interviews that you do, at some point I was like, maybe Elon has a model he's running in private and he's testing out comedy. 'Cause the day that works, he knows it's there. Yeah, AI can be pretty funny. If you ask Grok to do like a vulgar roast, it'll do a pretty good job. If you say even more vulgar and just keep going, it's really gonna get next level. It's gonna do unspeakable-- Like, say, vulgar roast yourself on Grok, and it's gonna do unspeakable things to you. What kind of comedy do you like? I guess I like absurdist humour. Comedy always had a place-- Like Monty Python or something like that. Comedy always had a place in society wherein the role of the jester was so important to every kingdom 'cause they said things in a funny way that could not be said in a straight way. Yeah, I guess so. Maybe we should have more jesters. Yeah. Is that what you're trying to do when you say something which is a joke? Say something you can't when you're not joking about it? I just like humour, you know? I think we should... I like comedy. I think it's funny. People should laugh, you know? It's good to generate a few chuckles once in a while. -Yeah, yeah. -Yeah. I mean, we don't wanna have a humourless society, you know? We'd dry. When you-- Dry. -When you have a friend, Elon-- -Who, me? -Yeah, I mean-- -Are you saying I have a friend? When you hang out with your friends, who are you? Like, I know there-- I wish I had friends, you know, honestly. No, I do have friends, actually. I think so. I hope so. Yeah, sure. Yeah, we have a good laugh. What does it look like? Like, every group has a dynamic. We talk words, you know. We eat food, sometimes. You know, once in a while, we swim in the pool. You know, normal things, I think. There's a limit as to what are things one can do with friends, you know? Chat. Discuss, you know, the nature of the universe. What do you emotionally get out of friendship? I don't know. I think the same thing anyone else would get out of friendship, you know? You wanna have, like, an emotional connection with other people. And, um, you wanna-- I don't know, you wanna talk about various subjects. Yeah, I mean, I generally talk about, I mean, a wide range of things, about the nature of the universe. I mean, a lot of philosophical discussions. You know, although, we have come to the conclusion that we should not talk about, um... AI or the simulation at parties, because we just talk about it too much. -You know, Aristotle-- -It's kind of a buzzkill at times. So... I can't remember who it was, Aristotle or Plato. They had a framework for how to pick a friend based on respect and mutual admiration, but people don't pick friends like that. Even me, I feel like I pick... my friends based on people who say and think -in a manner that I can resonate with. -Sure. I wouldn't pick a far-out-there, contrarian-to-my-own-belief-systems as a friend, because it would get tiring. Hanging out would get tiring. Are you like that? Do you pick friends who think like you, or do you look for the one who can debate you and be a contrarian to you? Well, I'm not, sort of, you know, going on like friendhunter.com... -Friendfinder.com -[laughter] ...to hunt down some friends. It's sort of, yeah-- I mean, I think it is just sort of people that you've resonated with somewhat... on an emotional and intellectual level. And, yeah, I mean, yeah. You know? And I guess a friend is someone who's gonna support you in difficult times, I suppose. A friend in need is a friend indeed. Like, if someone's still supporting you when the chips are down, that's a friend, you know. If somebody's not supporting you, or if somebody's only-- Like, fair-weather friends are useless, you know, they're not real friends. Like everyone likes you when the chips are up, but who likes you when the chips are down? That's a friend. With someone who has as many chips as you, would it matter? I mean, it's relative, you know. -With that particular thing-- -It's not just a chips thing. It's just like a-- Yeah, I mean-- There's this, sort of... Popularity waxes and wanes, you know? This is interesting. Does it wax and wane... only by virtue of the number of chips, or also by virtue of proximity to power and which one is bigger of the two? I don't know, like, what is power, you know? Like, power to do what? I would think in the traditional sense, elected power. -Position. -You mean how many gigawatts or whatever? More like how many volts. Yeah, like-- It's a voltage and amperage, you know. Don't touch the wires. Don't put a fork in the power outlet. You'll get a real feeling for power if you do that. Fair. Yeah, it's gonna be very visceral, yeah. [mimics electricity zapping] I know you like Nietzsche and Schopenhauer and-- Well, I've read their books, yeah, sure-- You spoke about how your childhood was... Yeah, I was just trying to find answers to the meaning of life, when I had, like, an existential crisis, and I don't know when I was, like, 12 or 13 or something. -They speak about the will to power. -Sure. Nietzsche said a lot of controversial things, you know. He was, sort of... I think he was, I mean, a bit of a troll, if you ask me. Troll, how? I mean, he'd just say controversial things to get a rise out of people. He lived a miserable life and died early. -Did he? -Yeah. Well, who says he lived a miserable life? -His sister, I think. -Okay, well, maybe she didn't like him. No, I think he got sick and he died, he got a disease. -I mean, allegedly syphilis or something. -Yeah. But there's only one way to get that, you know. So he might have had some fun along the way. I did want to ask you this. Milton Friedman speaks about the pencil. What? Why? Why does he go on about pencils? I have to say that after Nietzsche and syphilis. Why does Milton Friedman keep talking about pencils? There he goes again with the pencils. He won't stop. I swear to God, if I hear \"Milton talks about pencil\" one more time, I'm gonna lose my mind. He's just rabbiting on about pencils all day. Didn't even mention crayons. What I find interesting about his pencil argument. -Yeah? -He's-- Yeah, yeah, no, it's very difficult to make a pencil, you know. In one place. Think of all the things you have to do to make a pencil. Yeah, like the lead comes from a country, the wood comes from another country, the rubber from another. You've always been against tariffs, but... Yeah, I mean, I think, generally free trade is better, is more efficient, you know. Tariffs tend to create distortions in, you know, markets. And generally, like, you think about any given thing. Say like, would you want tariffs between you and everyone else at an individual level? That would make life very difficult. Would you want tariffs between each city? No, that would be very annoying. Would you want tariffs between each state within the United States? Like, no, that would be disastrous for the economy. So then why do you want tariffs between countries? -I agree. -Yeah. How do you think this plays out? What happens next? -What, with tariffs? Or what? -Yeah. I mean, the President has made it clear he loves tariffs. You know, I've tried to dissuade him from this point of view, but unsuccessfully. Yeah. -Fair. -Yeah. The relationship between business and politics. I was having this conversation with someone and we were thinking, which is the last-- How many large, really big, profitable businesses have been built in the last few decades without access to politics? -And... -Um, okay. Like, I don't know. Probably a lot, I don't know. -Not everything needs politics. -Yeah. I think, once you get to a certain scale, politics finds you. Yeah. It's quite unpleasant. I was reading-- I was reading this book about Michelangelo, and he's-- The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles? I used to watch that when I was a kid. -And I still love it. -It's quite compelling. Yeah, yeah, I used to love it. Michelangelo, Leonardo, Raphael, and who's the fourth one? -Donatello. -Yes. -Yeah. -No, but about the sculptor, the artist. And when he was sculpting David, a politician comes up to him and says, the nose is too big. So you know what Michelangelo does? Total power? So Michelangelo pretended to work from his scaffolding and threw some dust down, but didn't change anything. And he said, \"Okay, done.\" And the politician walked away happy. Is that how you deal with politics, sometimes? You know, I've generally found that when I get involved in politics, it ends up badly. So then I'm like, you know, \"Probably shouldn't do that.\" \"I should do less of that\", is my conclusion. Do you think that's true for all businessmen? Yeah, probably, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I mean, politics is a blood sport, you know? It's like you enter politics, they're gonna go for the jugular. So best to avoid politics where possible. What did DOGE teach you, if you learnt one thing? Well, it was like a very interesting side quest, you know, 'cause I just got to see like a lot of inner workings of the government. And, you know, there's been quite a few efficiencies. I mean, some of them are very basic efficiencies, like just adding in requirements for federal payments, that any given payment must have an assigned congressional payment code and a comment field with something in it that's more than nothing. Like, that trivial seeming change, my guess is, probably saves $100 billion or even $200 billion a year. Because there were massive numbers of payments that were going out with no congressional payment code and with nothing in the comment field, which makes auditing the payments impossible. So if you have to say like, why can the Defense Department-- Or now the Department of War-- Why can it not pass an audit? It's because the information is not there. It doesn't have-- The information necessary to pass an audit does not exist, is the issue. So a bunch of things that DOGE did were just very common sense, things that would be normal for any organisation that cared about financial responsibility. That's most of what was done. You know, and it's still going on, by the way. DOGE is still happening. But it turns out, when you stop fraudulent and wasteful payments, the fraudsters don't confess to this. They actually start yelling all sorts of nonsense that, \"You're stopping essential payments to needy people.\" But actually, you're not. We get this thing like saying, \"Oh, you've got to send this thing for whatever.\" It'd be like, \"This is going to children in Africa.\" And I'm like, \"Yeah, but then why are the wiring instructions for Deloitte & Touche in Washington, D.C.? Because that's not Africa.\" \"So can you please connect us with the recipients of this money in Africa?\" And then we get silence. Like, okay, we just want to literally talk to the recipients, that's it. Then we're like, \"Oh, no, it turns out, for some reason, we can't talk to them.\" Like, \"Well, we're not going to send the money unless we can talk to the recipients and confirm they will actually get it.\" You know... But, you know, that sort of... Fraudsters necessarily will come up with a very... you know, sympathetic argument. They're not going to say, \"Give us the money for fraud.\" That's not going to be what they say, obviously. They're going to try to make these sympathetic sounding arguments that are false. -They're going to start an NGO and then-- -Yeah, they're going to see NGO-- It's going to be like \"Save the Baby Pandas\" NGO, which is like, who doesn't want to save the baby pandas? They're adorable. But then, it turns out no pandas are being saved, okay, in this thing. It's just going to a bunch of-- It's just corruption, essentially. And you're like, \"Well, can you send us a picture of the panda?\" They're like, \"No.\" Okay. How do we know it's going to the pandas then? That's what I'm saying. What do you think of philanthropy? Yeah, I think we should... Well, I mean, I agree with love of humanity. And I think we should try to do things that help our fellow human beings. But it's very hard. Like, if you care about the reality of goodness rather than simply the perception of it, it's very difficult to give away money well. So I have a large foundation, but I don't put my name on it. And I don't, you know... In fact, I say, \"I don't want my name on anything.\" But the biggest challenge I find with my foundation is try to give money away in a way that is truly beneficial to people. It's very easy to give money away to get the appearance of goodness. It is very difficult to give money away for the reality of goodness. Very difficult. For a long time, the US had a lot of immigration, like really smart people coming into the country. -Yes. -We, back home in India, called it the \"brain drain.\" All our Indian-origin CEOs in Western companies. Yes, I think America has benefitted immensely from talented Indians that have come to America. That seems to be changing now, though. Yeah, I mean. Yeah, America has been an immense beneficiary of talent from India. Yeah. Why has that narrative changed of late? And America seems to have become anti-immigration to a certain extent. Like, I was passing immigration, and I was worried if they'd stopped me a couple of days ago. Well, I think there's different schools of thought. It's not like unanimous, but, you know, under the Biden administration, it was basically a total free-for-all with, like, no border controls, which unless you've got border controls, you're not a country. So you had massive amounts of illegal immigration under Biden. And it actually also had like somewhat of a negative selection effect. So, if there's a massive financial incentive to come to the US illegally and get all these government benefits, then you're gonna necessarily create a diffusion gradient for people to come to the US It's an incentive structure. And so, I think, that obviously made no sense. Like, you gotta have border controls. That's kind of ridiculous not to. Then that's... So, the left wants to basically have open borders, no holds barred. You know, it doesn't matter if someone-- what their situation is, they could be a criminal, it doesn't matter. Then on the right, you've got, you know, at least a perception that somehow their jobs are being taken by talented people from other countries. I don't know how real that is. My direct observation is that there's always a scarcity of talented people. So, from my standpoint, I'm like, \"We have a lot of difficulty finding enough talented people to get these difficult tasks done. And so more talented people would be good.\" But I guess, some companies out there, it's sort of, they're making it more of a cost thing, where it's like, okay, if they can employ someone for a fraction of the cost of an American citizen, then, I guess, these other companies would hire people just to save costs. But, at my companies, the issue is we just are trying to get the most talented people in the world. And we pay way above average. So I can't say-- So, that's not my experience. But that's what a lot of people do complain about. And I think there's been some misuse of the H-1B Program. It would be accurate to say that there's, like, some of the outsourcing companies have kind of gamed the system on the H-1B front. And we need to stop the gaming of the system, you know? But I'm certainly not in the school of thought that we should shut down the H-1B Program. That's-- Which some on the right are. I think they don't realise that that would actually be very bad. If you could speak to the people of my country, India, the young entrepreneurs who want to build... -Right. -...and say a message to them, what would you say? I'm a big fan of anyone who wants to build. So I think anyone who wants to... you know, make more than they take, has my respect. So that's the main thing you should aim for, aim to make more than you take. Be a, you know, a net contributor to society. And it's kind of like the pursuit of happiness. You know, if you want to create something valuable financially, you don't pursue that. It's best to actually pursue providing useful products and services. If you do that, then money will come as a natural consequence of that, as opposed to pursuing money directly. Just like you can't, sort of, pursue happiness directly, you pursue things that lead to happiness. But there's not like direct happiness pursuit. You do things like... I guess, fulfilling work, or study, or friends, loved ones, that, as a result, make you happy. So, it sounds very obvious... but, generally, if somebody's trying to make a company work, they should expect to grind super hard, accept that there's, like, some meaningful chance of failure, but just be focused on having the output be worth more than the input. That are you a value creator? That's what really matters. Making more than you take. I think that's a good way to end this. -Lauren is asking us to wrap up. -All right. I also like to take the opportunity to thank my friend, Manoj, in IGF. He does a great job of connecting, I think, Indians, like the group here, with people like you, in order to... of many things, I think, get to know each other and become friends, because once we are friends, maybe we can start working together. So, thank you, Manoj, for putting this whole thing together, and thank you, IGF. [audience applauding] And, thank you so much, Elon, for taking the time. You're welcome. -Did you have fun? Was it boring? -Yeah, it was an interesting conversation. Sometimes, they take these answers out of context. But... I think it was a good conversation."

      "transcript": "Chris Anderson: Elon Musk, great to see you. How are you? Elon Musk: Good. How are you? CA: We're here at the Texas Gigafactory the day before this thing opens. It's been pretty crazy out there. Thank you so much for making time on a busy day. I would love you to help us, kind of, cast our minds, I don't know, 10, 20, 30 years into the future. And help us try to picture what it would take to build a future that's worth getting excited about. The last time you spoke at TED, you said that that was really just a big driver. You know, you can talk about lots of other reasons to do the work you're doing, but fundamentally, you want to think about the future and not think that it sucks. EM: Yeah, absolutely. I think in general, you know, there's a lot of discussion of like, this problem or that problem. And a lot of people are sad about the future and they're ... Pessimistic. And I think ... this is ... This is not great. I mean, we really want to wake up in the morning and look forward to the future. We want to be excited about what's going to happen. And life cannot simply be about sort of, solving one miserable problem after another. CA: So if you look forward 30 years, you know, the year 2050 has been labeled by scientists as this, kind of, almost like this doomsday deadline on climate. There's a consensus of scientists, a large consensus of scientists, who believe that if we haven't completely eliminated greenhouse gases or offset them completely by 2050, effectively we're inviting climate catastrophe. Do you believe there is a pathway to avoid that catastrophe? And what would it look like? EM: Yeah, so I am not one of the doomsday people, which may surprise you. I actually think we're on a good path. But at the same time, I want to caution against complacency. So, so long as we are not complacent, as long as we have a high sense of urgency about moving towards a sustainable energy economy, then I think things will be fine. So I can't emphasize that enough, as long as we push hard and are not complacent, the future is going to be great. Don't worry about it. I mean, worry about it, but if you worry about it, ironically, it will be a self-unfulfilling prophecy. So, like, there are three elements to a sustainable energy future. One is of sustainable energy generation, which is primarily wind and solar. There's also hydro, geothermal, I'm actually pro-nuclear. I think nuclear is fine. But it's going to be primarily solar and wind, as the primary generators of energy. The second part is you need batteries to store the solar and wind energy because the sun doesn't shine all the time, the wind doesn't blow all the time. So it's a lot of stationary battery packs. And then you need electric transport. So electric cars, electric planes, boats. And then ultimately, it’s not really possible to make electric rockets, but you can make the propellant used in rockets using sustainable energy. So ultimately, we can have a fully sustainable energy economy. And it's those three things: solar/wind, stationary battery pack, electric vehicles. So then what are the limiting factors on progress? The limiting factor really will be battery cell production. So that's going to really be the fundamental rate driver. And then whatever the slowest element of the whole lithium-ion battery cells supply chain, from mining and the many steps of refining to ultimately creating a battery cell and putting it into a pack, that will be the limiting factor on progress towards sustainability. CA: All right, so we need to talk more about batteries, because the key thing that I want to understand, like, there seems to be a scaling issue here that is kind of amazing and alarming. You have said that you have calculated that the amount of battery production that the world needs for sustainability is 300 terawatt hours of batteries. That's the end goal? EM: Very rough numbers, and I certainly would invite others to check our calculations because they may arrive at different conclusions. But in order to transition, not just current electricity production, but also heating and transport, which roughly triples the amount of electricity that you need, it amounts to approximately 300 terawatt hours of installed capacity. CA: So we need to give people a sense of how big a task that is. I mean, here we are at the Gigafactory. You know, this is one of the biggest buildings in the world. What I've read, and tell me if this is still right, is that the goal here is to eventually produce 100 gigawatt hours of batteries here a year eventually. EM: We will probably do more than that, but yes, hopefully we get there within a couple of years. CA: Right. But I mean, that is one -- EM: 0.1 terrawat hours. CA: But that's still 1/100 of what's needed. How much of the rest of that 100 is Tesla planning to take on let's say, between now and 2030, 2040, when we really need to see the scale up happen? EM: I mean, these are just guesses. So please, people shouldn't hold me to these things. It's not like this is like some -- What tends to happen is I'll make some like, you know, best guess and then people, in five years, there’ll be some jerk that writes an article: \"Elon said this would happen, and it didn't happen. He's a liar and a fool.\" It's very annoying when that happens. So these are just guesses, this is a conversation. CA: Right. EM: I think Tesla probably ends up doing 10 percent of that. Roughly. CA: Let's say 2050 we have this amazing, you know, 100 percent sustainable electric grid made up of, you know, some mixture of the sustainable energy sources you talked about. That same grid probably is offering the world really low-cost energy, isn't it, compared with now. And I'm curious about like, are people entitled to get a little bit excited about the possibilities of that world? EM: People should be optimistic about the future. Humanity will solve sustainable energy. It will happen if we, you know, continue to push hard, the future is bright and good from an energy standpoint. And then it will be possible to also use that energy to do carbon sequestration. It takes a lot of energy to pull carbon out of the atmosphere because in putting it in the atmosphere it releases energy. So now, you know, obviously in order to pull it out, you need to use a lot of energy. But if you've got a lot of sustainable energy from wind and solar, you can actually sequester carbon. So you can reverse the CO2 parts per million of the atmosphere and oceans. And also you can really have as much fresh water as you want. Earth is mostly water. We should call Earth “Water.” It's 70 percent water by surface area. Now most of that’s seawater, but it's like we just happen to be on the bit that's land. CA: And with energy, you can turn seawater into -- EM: Yes. CA: Irrigating water or whatever water you need. EM: At very low cost. Things will be good. CA: Things will be good. And also, there's other benefits to this non-fossil fuel world where the air is cleaner -- EM: Yes, exactly. Because, like, when you burn fossil fuels, there's all these side reactions and toxic gases of various kinds. And sort of little particulates that are bad for your lungs. Like, there's all sorts of bad things that are happening that will go away. And the sky will be cleaner and quieter. The future's going to be good. CA: I want us to switch now to think a bit about artificial intelligence. But the segue there, you mentioned how annoying it is when people call you up for bad predictions in the past. So I'm possibly going to be annoying now, but I’m curious about your timelines and how you predict and how come some things are so amazingly on the money and some aren't. So when it comes to predicting sales of Tesla vehicles, for example, you've kind of been amazing, I think in 2014 when Tesla had sold that year 60,000 cars, you said, \"2020, I think we will do half a million a year.\" EM: Yeah, we did almost exactly a half million. CA: You did almost exactly half a million. You were scoffed in 2014 because no one since Henry Ford, with the Model T, had come close to that kind of growth rate for cars. You were scoffed, and you actually hit 500,000 cars and then 510,000 or whatever produced. But five years ago, last time you came to TED, I asked you about full self-driving, and you said, “Yeah, this very year, I'm confident that we will have a car going from LA to New York without any intervention.\" EM: Yeah, I don't want to blow your mind, but I'm not always right. CA: (Laughs) What's the difference between those two? Why has full self-driving in particular been so hard to predict? EM: I mean, the thing that really got me, and I think it's going to get a lot of other people, is that there are just so many false dawns with self-driving, where you think you've got the problem, have a handle on the problem, and then it, no, turns out you just hit a ceiling. Because if you were to plot the progress, the progress looks like a log curve. So it's like a series of log curves. So most people don't know what a log curve is, I suppose. CA: Show the shape with your hands. EM: It goes up you know, sort of a fairly straight way, and then it starts tailing off and you start getting diminishing returns. And you're like, uh oh, it was trending up and now it's sort of, curving over and you start getting to these, what I call local maxima, where you don't realize basically how dumb you were. And then it happens again. And ultimately... These things, you know, in retrospect, they seem obvious, but in order to solve full self-driving properly, you actually have to solve real-world AI. Because what are the road networks designed to work with? They're designed to work with a biological neural net, our brains, and with vision, our eyes. And so in order to make it work with computers, you basically need to solve real-world AI and vision. Because we need cameras and silicon neural nets in order to have self-driving work for a system that was designed for eyes and biological neural nets. You know, I guess when you put it that way, it's sort of, like, quite obvious that the only way to solve full self-driving is to solve real world AI and sophisticated vision. CA: What do you feel about the current architecture? Do you think you have an architecture now where there is a chance for the logarithmic curve not to tail off any anytime soon? EM: Well I mean, admittedly these may be infamous last words, but I actually am confident that we will solve it this year. That we will exceed -- The probability of an accident, at what point do you exceed that of the average person? I think we will exceed that this year. CA: What are you seeing behind the scenes that gives you that confidence? EM: We’re almost at the point where we have a high-quality unified vector space. In the beginning, we were trying to do this with image recognition on individual images. But if you get one image out of a video, it's actually quite hard to see what's going on without ambiguity. But if you look at a video segment of a few seconds of video, that ambiguity resolves. So the first thing we had to do is tie all eight cameras together so they're synchronized, so that all the frames are looked at simultaneously and labeled simultaneously by one person, because we still need human labeling. So at least they’re not labeled at different times by different people in different ways. So it's sort of a surround picture. Then a very important part is to add the time dimension. So that you’re looking at surround video, and you're labeling surround video. And this is actually quite difficult to do from a software standpoint. We had to write our own labeling tools and then create auto labeling, create auto labeling software to amplify the efficiency of human labelers because it’s quite hard to label. In the beginning, it was taking several hours to label a 10-second video clip. This is not scalable. So basically what you have to have is you have to have surround video, and that surround video has to be primarily automatically labeled with humans just being editors and making slight corrections to the labeling of the video and then feeding back those corrections into the future auto labeler, so you get this flywheel eventually where the auto labeler is able to take in vast amounts of video and with high accuracy, automatically label the video for cars, lane lines, drive space. CA: What you’re saying is ... the result of this is that you're effectively giving the car a 3D model of the actual objects that are all around it. It knows what they are, and it knows how fast they are moving. And the remaining task is to predict what the quirky behaviors are that, you know, that when a pedestrian is walking down the road with a smaller pedestrian, that maybe that smaller pedestrian might do something unpredictable or things like that. You have to build into it before you can really call it safe. EM: You basically need to have memory across time and space. So what I mean by that is ... Memory can’t be infinite, because it's using up a lot of the computer's RAM basically. So you have to say how much are you going to try to remember? It's very common for things to be occluded. So if you talk about say, a pedestrian walking past a truck where you saw the pedestrian start on one side of the truck, then they're occluded by the truck. You would know intuitively, OK, that pedestrian is going to pop out the other side, most likely. CA: A computer doesn't know it. EM: You need to slow down. CA: A skeptic is going to say that every year for the last five years, you've kind of said, well, no this is the year, we're confident that it will be there in a year or two or, you know, like it's always been about that far away. But we've got a new architecture now, you're seeing enough improvement behind the scenes to make you not certain, but pretty confident, that, by the end of this year, what in most, not in every city, and every circumstance but in many cities and circumstances, basically the car will be able to drive without interventions safer than a human. EM: Yes. I mean, the car currently drives me around Austin most of the time with no interventions. So it's not like ... And we have over 100,000 people in our full self-driving beta program. So you can look at the videos that they post online. CA: I do. And some of them are great, and some of them are a little terrifying. I mean, occasionally the car seems to veer off and scare the hell out of people. EM: It’s still a beta. CA: But you’re behind the scenes, looking at the data, you're seeing enough improvement to believe that a this-year timeline is real. EM: Yes, that's what it seems like. I mean, we could be here talking again in a year, like, well, another year went by, and it didn’t happen. But I think this is the year. CA: And so in general, when people talk about Elon time, I mean it sounds like you can't just have a general rule that if you predict that something will be done in six months, actually what we should imagine is it’s going to be a year or it’s like two-x or three-x, it depends on the type of prediction. Some things, I guess, things involving software, AI, whatever, are fundamentally harder to predict than others. Is there an element that you actually deliberately make aggressive prediction timelines to drive people to be ambitious? Without that, nothing gets done? EM: Well, I generally believe, in terms of internal timelines, that we want to set the most aggressive timeline that we can. Because there’s sort of like a law of gaseous expansion where, for schedules, where whatever time you set, it's not going to be less than that. It's very rare that it'll be less than that. But as far as our predictions are concerned, what tends to happen in the media is that they will report all the wrong ones and ignore all the right ones. Or, you know, when writing an article about me -- I've had a long career in multiple industries. If you list my sins, I sound like the worst person on Earth. But if you put those against the things I've done right, it makes much more sense, you know? So essentially like, the longer you do anything, the more mistakes that you will make cumulatively. Which, if you sum up those mistakes, will sound like I'm the worst predictor ever. But for example, for Tesla vehicle growth, I said I think we’d do 50 percent, and we’ve done 80 percent. CA: Yes. EM: But they don't mention that one. So, I mean, I'm not sure what my exact track record is on predictions. They're more optimistic than pessimistic, but they're not all optimistic. Some of them are exceeded probably more or later, but they do come true. It's very rare that they do not come true. It's sort of like, you know, if there's some radical technology prediction, the point is not that it was a few years late, but that it happened at all. That's the more important part. CA: So it feels like at some point in the last year, seeing the progress on understanding, the Tesla AI understanding the world around it, led to a kind of, an aha moment at Tesla. Because you really surprised people recently when you said probably the most important product development going on at Tesla this year is this robot, Optimus. EM: Yes. CA: Many companies out there have tried to put out these robots, they've been working on them for years. And so far no one has really cracked it. There's no mass adoption robot in people's homes. There are some in manufacturing, but I would say, no one's kind of, really cracked it. Is it something that happened in the development of full self-driving that gave you the confidence to say, \"You know what, we could do something special here.\" EM: Yeah, exactly. So, you know, it took me a while to sort of realize that in order to solve self-driving, you really needed to solve real-world AI. And at the point of which you solve real-world AI for a car, which is really a robot on four wheels, you can then generalize that to a robot on legs as well. The two hard parts I think -- like obviously companies like Boston Dynamics have shown that it's possible to make quite compelling, sometimes alarming robots. CA: Right. EM: You know, so from a sensors and actuators standpoint, it's certainly been demonstrated by many that it's possible to make a humanoid robot. The things that are currently missing are enough intelligence for the robot to navigate the real world and do useful things without being explicitly instructed. So the missing things are basically real-world intelligence and scaling up manufacturing. Those are two things that Tesla is very good at. And so then we basically just need to design the specialized actuators and sensors that are needed for humanoid robot. People have no idea, this is going to be bigger than the car. CA: So let's dig into exactly that. I mean, in one way, it's actually an easier problem than full self-driving because instead of an object going along at 60 miles an hour, which if it gets it wrong, someone will die. This is an object that's engineered to only go at what, three or four or five miles an hour. And so a mistake, there aren't lives at stake. There might be embarrassment at stake. EM: So long as the AI doesn't take it over and murder us in our sleep or something. CA: Right. (Laughter) So talk about -- I think the first applications you've mentioned are probably going to be manufacturing, but eventually the vision is to have these available for people at home. If you had a robot that really understood the 3D architecture of your house and knew where every object in that house was or was supposed to be, and could recognize all those objects, I mean, that’s kind of amazing, isn’t it? Like the kind of thing that you could ask a robot to do would be what? Like, tidy up? EM: Yeah, absolutely. Make dinner, I guess, mow the lawn. CA: Take a cup of tea to grandma and show her family pictures. EM: Exactly. Take care of my grandmother and make sure -- CA: It could obviously recognize everyone in the home. It could play catch with your kids. EM: Yes. I mean, obviously, we need to be careful this doesn't become a dystopian situation. I think one of the things that's going to be important is to have a localized ROM chip on the robot that cannot be updated over the air. Where if you, for example, were to say, “Stop, stop, stop,” if anyone said that, then the robot would stop, you know, type of thing. And that's not updatable remotely. I think it's going to be important to have safety features like that. CA: Yeah, that sounds wise. EM: And I do think there should be a regulatory agency for AI. I've said that for many years. I don't love being regulated, but I think this is an important thing for public safety. CA: Let's come back to that. But I don't think many people have really sort of taken seriously the notion of, you know, a robot at home. I mean, at the start of the computing revolution, Bill Gates said there's going to be a computer in every home. And people at the time said, yeah, whatever, who would even want that. Do you think there will be basically like in, say, 2050 or whatever, like a robot in most homes, is what there will be, and people will love them and count on them? You’ll have your own butler basically. EM: Yeah, you'll have your sort of buddy robot probably, yeah. CA: I mean, how much of a buddy? How many applications have you thought, you know, can you have a romantic partner, a sex partner? EM: It's probably inevitable. I mean, I did promise the internet that I’d make catgirls. We could make a robot catgirl. CA: Be careful what you promise the internet. (Laughter) EM: So, yeah, I guess it'll be whatever people want really, you know. CA: What sort of timeline should we be thinking about of the first models that are actually made and sold? EM: Well, you know, the first units that we intend to make are for jobs that are dangerous, boring, repetitive, and things that people don't want to do. And, you know, I think we’ll have like an interesting prototype sometime this year. We might have something useful next year, but I think quite likely within at least two years. And then we'll see rapid growth year over year of the usefulness of the humanoid robots and decrease in cost and scaling up production. CA: Initially just selling to businesses, or when do you picture you'll start selling them where you can buy your parents one for Christmas or something? EM: I'd say in less than ten years. CA: Help me on the economics of this. So what do you picture the cost of one of these being? EM: Well, I think the cost is actually not going to be crazy high. Like less than a car. Initially, things will be expensive because it'll be a new technology at low production volume. The complexity and cost of a car is greater than that of a humanoid robot. So I would expect that it's going to be less than a car, or at least equivalent to a cheap car. CA: So even if it starts at 50k, within a few years, it’s down to 20k or lower or whatever. And maybe for home they'll get much cheaper still. But think about the economics of this. If you can replace a $30,000, $40,000-a-year worker, which you have to pay every year, with a one-time payment of $25,000 for a robot that can work longer hours, a pretty rapid replacement of certain types of jobs. How worried should the world be about that? EM: I wouldn't worry about the sort of, putting people out of a job thing. I think we're actually going to have, and already do have, a massive shortage of labor. So I think we will have ... Not people out of work, but actually still a shortage labor even in the future. But this really will be a world of abundance. Any goods and services will be available to anyone who wants them. It'll be so cheap to have goods and services, it will be ridiculous. CA: I'm presuming it should be possible to imagine a bunch of goods and services that can't profitably be made now but could be made in that world, courtesy of legions of robots. EM: Yeah. It will be a world of abundance. The only scarcity that will exist in the future is that which we decide to create ourselves as humans. CA: OK. So AI is allowing us to imagine a differently powered economy that will create this abundance. What are you most worried about going wrong? EM: Well, like I said, AI and robotics will bring out what might be termed the age of abundance. Other people have used this word, and that this is my prediction: it will be an age of abundance for everyone. But I guess there’s ... The dangers would be the artificial general intelligence or digital superintelligence decouples from a collective human will and goes in the direction that for some reason we don't like. Whatever direction it might go. You know, that’s sort of the idea behind Neuralink, is to try to more tightly couple collective human world to digital superintelligence. And also along the way solve a lot of brain injuries and spinal injuries and that kind of thing. So even if it doesn't succeed in the greater goal, I think it will succeed in the goal of alleviating brain and spine damage. CA: So the spirit there is that if we're going to make these AIs that are so vastly intelligent, we ought to be wired directly to them so that we ourselves can have those superpowers more directly. But that doesn't seem to avoid the risk that those superpowers might ... turn ugly in unintended ways. EM: I think it's a risk, I agree. I'm not saying that I have some certain answer to that risk. I’m just saying like maybe one of the things that would be good for ensuring that the future is one that we want is to more tightly couple the collective human world to digital intelligence. The issue that we face here is that we are already a cyborg, if you think about it. The computers are an extension of ourselves. And when we die, we have, like, a digital ghost. You know, all of our text messages and social media, emails. And it's quite eerie actually, when someone dies but everything online is still there. But you say like, what's the limitation? What is it that inhibits a human-machine symbiosis? It's the data rate. When you communicate, especially with a phone, you're moving your thumbs very slowly. So you're like moving your two little meat sticks at a rate that’s maybe 10 bits per second, optimistically, 100 bits per second. And computers are communicating at the gigabyte level and beyond. CA: Have you seen evidence that the technology is actually working, that you've got a richer, sort of, higher bandwidth connection, if you like, between like external electronics and a brain than has been possible before? EM: Yeah. I mean, the fundamental principles of reading neurons, sort of doing read-write on neurons with tiny electrodes, have been demonstrated for decades. So it's not like the concept is new. The problem is that there is no product that works well that you can go and buy. So it's all sort of, in research labs. And it's like some cords sticking out of your head. And it's quite gruesome, and it's really ... There's no good product that actually does a good job and is high-bandwidth and safe and something actually that you could buy and would want to buy. But the way to think of the Neuralink device is kind of like a Fitbit or an Apple Watch. That's where we take out sort of a small section of skull about the size of a quarter, replace that with what, in many ways really is very much like a Fitbit, Apple Watch or some kind of smart watch thing. But with tiny, tiny wires, very, very tiny wires. Wires so tiny, it’s hard to even see them. And it's very important to have very tiny wires so that when they’re implanted, they don’t damage the brain. CA: How far are you from putting these into humans? EM: Well, we have put in our FDA application to aspirationally do the first human implant this year. CA: The first uses will be for neurological injuries of different kinds. But rolling the clock forward and imagining when people are actually using these for their own enhancement, let's say, and for the enhancement of the world, how clear are you in your mind as to what it will feel like to have one of these inside your head? EM: Well, I do want to emphasize we're at an early stage. And so it really will be many years before we have anything approximating a high-bandwidth neural interface that allows for AI-human symbiosis. For many years, we will just be solving brain injuries and spinal injuries. For probably a decade. This is not something that will suddenly one day it will have this incredible sort of whole brain interface. It's going to be, like I said, at least a decade of really just solving brain injuries and spinal injuries. And really, I think you can solve a very wide range of brain injuries, including severe depression, morbid obesity, sleep, potentially schizophrenia, like, a lot of things that cause great stress to people. Restoring memory in older people. CA: If you can pull that off, that's the app I will sign up for. EM: Absolutely. CA: Please hurry. (Laughs) EM: I mean, the emails that we get at Neuralink are heartbreaking. I mean, they'll send us just tragic, you know, where someone was sort of, in the prime of life and they had an accident on a motorcycle and someone who's 25, you know, can't even feed themselves. And this is something we could fix. CA: But you have said that AI is one of the things you're most worried about and that Neuralink may be one of the ways where we can keep abreast of it. EM: Yeah, there's the short-term thing, which I think is helpful on an individual human level with injuries. And then the long-term thing is an attempt to address the civilizational risk of AI by bringing digital intelligence and biological intelligence closer together. I mean, if you think of how the brain works today, there are really two layers to the brain. There's the limbic system and the cortex. You've got the kind of, animal brain where -- it’s kind of like the fun part, really. CA: It's where most of Twitter operates, by the way. EM: I think Tim Urban said, we’re like somebody, you know, stuck a computer on a monkey. You know, so we're like, if you gave a monkey a computer, that's our cortex. But we still have a lot of monkey instincts. Which we then try to rationalize as, no, it's not a monkey instinct. It’s something more important than that. But it's often just really a monkey instinct. We're just monkeys with a computer stuck in our brain. But even though the cortex is sort of the smart, or the intelligent part of the brain, the thinking part of the brain, I've not yet met anyone who wants to delete their limbic system or their cortex. They're quite happy having both. Everyone wants both parts of their brain. And people really want their phones and their computers, which are really the tertiary, the third part of your intelligence. It's just that it's ... Like the bandwidth, the rate of communication with that tertiary layer is slow. And it's just a very tiny straw to this tertiary layer. And we want to make that tiny straw a big highway. And I’m definitely not saying that this is going to solve everything. Or this is you know, it’s the only thing -- it’s something that might be helpful. And worst-case scenario, I think we solve some important brain injury, spinal injury issues, and that's still a great outcome. CA: Best-case scenario, we may discover new human possibility, telepathy, you've spoken of, in a way, a connection with a loved one, you know, full memory and much faster thought processing maybe. All these things. It's very cool. If AI were to take down Earth, we need a plan B. Let's shift our attention to space. We spoke last time at TED about reusability, and you had just demonstrated that spectacularly for the first time. Since then, you've gone on to build this monster rocket, Starship, which kind of changes the rules of the game in spectacular ways. Tell us about Starship. EM: Starship is extremely fundamental. So the holy grail of rocketry or space transport is full and rapid reusability. This has never been achieved. The closest that anything has come is our Falcon 9 rocket, where we are able to recover the first stage, the boost stage, which is probably about 60 percent of the cost of the vehicle of the whole launch, maybe 70 percent. And we've now done that over a hundred times. So with Starship, we will be recovering the entire thing. Or at least that's the goal. CA: Right. EM: And moreover, recovering it in such a way that it can be immediately re-flown. Whereas with Falcon 9, we still need to do some amount of refurbishment to the booster and to the fairing nose cone. But with Starship, the design goal is immediate re-flight. So you just refill propellants and go again. And this is gigantic. Just as it would be in any other mode of transport. CA: And the main design is to basically take 100 plus people at a time, plus a bunch of things that they need, to Mars. So, first of all, talk about that piece. What is your latest timeline? One, for the first time, a Starship goes to Mars, presumably without people, but just equipment. Two, with people. Three, there’s sort of, OK, 100 people at a time, let's go. EM: Sure. And just to put the cost thing into perspective, the expected cost of Starship, putting 100 tons into orbit, is significantly less than what it would have cost or what it did cost to put our tiny Falcon 1 rocket into orbit. Just as the cost of flying a 747 around the world is less than the cost of a small airplane. You know, a small airplane that was thrown away. So it's really pretty mind-boggling that the giant thing costs less, way less than the small thing. So it doesn't use exotic propellants or things that are difficult to obtain on Mars. It uses methane as fuel, and it's primarily oxygen, roughly 77-78 percent oxygen by weight. And Mars has a CO2 atmosphere and has water ice, which is CO2 plus H2O, so you can make CH4, methane, and O2, oxygen, on Mars. CA: Presumably, one of the first tasks on Mars will be to create a fuel plant that can create the fuel for the return trips of many Starships. EM: Yes. And actually, it's mostly going to be oxygen plants, because it's 78 percent oxygen, 22 percent fuel. But the fuel is a simple fuel that is easy to create on Mars. And in many other parts of the solar system. So basically ... And it's all propulsive landing, no parachutes, nothing thrown away. It has a heat shield that’s capable of entering on Earth or Mars. We can even potentially go to Venus. but you don't want to go there. (Laughs) Venus is hell, almost literally. But you could ... It's a generalized method of transport to anywhere in the solar system, because the point at which you have propellant depo on Mars, you can then travel to the asteroid belt and to the moons of Jupiter and Saturn and ultimately anywhere in the solar system. CA: But your main focus and SpaceX's main focus is still Mars. That is the mission. That is where most of the effort will go? Or are you actually imagining a much broader array of uses even in the coming, you know, the first decade or so of uses of this. Where we could go, for example, to other places in the solar system to explore, perhaps NASA wants to use the rocket for that reason. EM: Yeah, NASA is planning to use a Starship to return to the moon, to return people to the moon. And so we're very honored that NASA has chosen us to do this. But I'm saying it is a generalized -- it’s a general solution to getting anywhere in the greater solar system. It's not suitable for going to another star system, but it is a general solution for transport anywhere in the solar system. CA: Before it can do any of that, it's got to demonstrate it can get into orbit, you know, around Earth. What’s your latest advice on the timeline for that? EM: It's looking promising for us to have an orbital launch attempt in a few months. So we're actually integrating -- will be integrating the engines into the booster for the first orbital flight starting in about a week or two. And the launch complex itself is ready to go. So assuming we get regulatory approval, I think we could have an orbital launch attempt within a few months. CA: And a radical new technology like this presumably there is real risk on those early attempts. EM: Oh, 100 percent, yeah. The joke I make all the time is that excitement is guaranteed. Success is not guaranteed, but excitement certainly is. CA: But the last I saw on your timeline, you've slightly put back the expected date to put the first human on Mars till 2029, I want to say? EM: Yeah, I mean, so let's see. I mean, we have built a production system for Starship, so we're making a lot of ships and boosters. CA: How many are you planning to make actually? EM: Well, we're currently expecting to make a booster and a ship roughly every, well, initially, roughly every couple of months, and then hopefully by the end of this year, one every month. So it's giant rockets, and a lot of them. Just talking in terms of rough orders of magnitude, in order to create a self-sustaining city on Mars, I think you will need something on the order of a thousand ships. And we just need a Helen of Sparta, I guess, on Mars. CA: This is not in most people's heads, Elon. EM: The planet that launched 1,000 ships. CA: That's nice. But this is not in most people's heads, this picture that you have in your mind. There's basically a two-year window, you can only really fly to Mars conveniently every two years. You were picturing that during the 2030s, every couple of years, something like 1,000 Starships take off, each containing 100 or more people. That picture is just completely mind-blowing to me. That sense of this armada of humans going to -- EM: It'll be like \"Battlestar Galactica,\" the fleet departs. CA: And you think that it can basically be funded by people spending maybe a couple hundred grand on a ticket to Mars? Is that price about where it has been? EM: Well, I think if you say like, what's required in order to get enough people and enough cargo to Mars to build a self-sustaining city. And it's where you have an intersection of sets of people who want to go, because I think only a small percentage of humanity will want to go, and can afford to go or get sponsorship in some manner. That intersection of sets, I think, needs to be a million people or something like that. And so it’s what can a million people afford, or get sponsorship for, because I think governments will also pay for it, and people can take out loans. But I think at the point at which you say, OK, like, if moving to Mars costs are, for argument’s sake, $100,000, then I think you know, almost anyone can work and save up and eventually have $100,000 and be able to go to Mars if they want. We want to make it available to anyone who wants to go. It's very important to emphasize that Mars, especially in the beginning, will not be luxurious. It will be dangerous, cramped, difficult, hard work. It's kind of like that Shackleton ad for going to the Antarctic, which I think is actually not real, but it sounds real and it's cool. It's sort of like, the sales pitch for going to Mars is, \"It's dangerous, it's cramped. You might not make it back. It's difficult, it's hard work.\" That's the sales pitch. CA: Right. But you will make history. EM: But it'll be glorious. CA: So on that kind of launch rate you're talking about over two decades, you could get your million people to Mars, essentially. Whose city is it? Is it NASA's city, is it SpaceX's city? EM: It’s the people of Mars’ city. The reason for this, I mean, I feel like why do this thing? I think this is important for maximizing the probable lifespan of humanity or consciousness. Human civilization could come to an end for external reasons, like a giant meteor or super volcanoes or extreme climate change. Or World War III, or you know, any one of a number of reasons. But the probable life span of civilizational consciousness as we know it, which we should really view as this very delicate thing, like a small candle in a vast darkness. That is what appears to be the case. We're in this vast darkness of space, and there's this little candle of consciousness that’s only really come about after 4.5 billion years, and it could just go out. CA: I think that's powerful, and I think a lot of people will be inspired by that vision. And the reason you need the million people is because there has to be enough people there to do everything that you need to survive. EM: Really, like the critical threshold is if the ships from Earth stop coming for any reason, does the Mars City die out or not? And so we have to -- You know, people talk about like, the sort of, the great filters, the things that perhaps, you know, we talk about the Fermi paradox, and where are the aliens? Well maybe there are these various great filters that the aliens didn’t pass, and so they eventually just ceased to exist. And one of the great filters is becoming a multi-planet species. So we want to pass that filter. And I'll be long-dead before this is, you know, a real thing, before it happens. But I’d like to at least see us make great progress in this direction. CA: Given how tortured the Earth is right now, how much we're beating each other up, shouldn't there be discussions going on with everyone who is dreaming about Mars to try to say, we've got a once in a civilization's chance to make some new rules here? Should someone be trying to lead those discussions to figure out what it means for this to be the people of Mars' City? EM: Well, I think ultimately this will be up to the people of Mars to decide how they want to rethink society. Yeah there’s certainly risk there. And hopefully the people of Mars will be more enlightened and will not fight amongst each other too much. I mean, I have some recommendations, which people of Mars may choose to listen to or not. I would advocate for more of a direct democracy, not a representative democracy, and laws that are short enough for people to understand. Where it is harder to create laws than to get rid of them. CA: Coming back a bit nearer term, I'd love you to just talk a bit about some of the other possibility space that Starship seems to have created. So given -- Suddenly we've got this ability to move 100 tons-plus into orbit. So we've just launched the James Webb telescope, which is an incredible thing. It's unbelievable. EM: Exquisite piece of technology. CA: Exquisite piece of technology. But people spent two years trying to figure out how to fold up this thing. It's a three-ton telescope. EM: We can make it a lot easier if you’ve got more volume and mass. CA: But let's ask a different question. Which is, how much more powerful a telescope could someone design based on using Starship, for example? EM: I mean, roughly, I'd say it's probably an order of magnitude more resolution. If you've got 100 tons and a thousand cubic meters volume, which is roughly what we have. CA: And what about other exploration through the solar system? I mean, I'm you know -- EM: Europa is a big question mark. CA: Right, so there's an ocean there. And what you really want to do is to drop a submarine into that ocean. EM: Maybe there's like, some squid civilization, cephalopod civilization under the ice of Europa. That would be pretty interesting. CA: I mean, Elon, if you could take a submarine to Europa and we see pictures of this thing being devoured by a squid, that would honestly be the happiest moment of my life. EM: Pretty wild, yeah. CA: What other possibilities are out there? Like, it feels like if you're going to create a thousand of these things, they can only fly to Mars every two years. What are they doing the rest of the time? It feels like there's this explosion of possibility that I don't think people are really thinking about. EM: I don't know, we've certainly got a long way to go. As you alluded to earlier, we still have to get to orbit. And then after we get to orbit, we have to really prove out and refine full and rapid reusability. That'll take a moment. But I do think we will solve this. I'm highly confident we will solve this at this point. CA: Do you ever wake up with the fear that there's going to be this Hindenburg moment for SpaceX where ... EM: We've had many Hindenburg. Well, we've never had Hindenburg moments with people, which is very important. Big difference. We've blown up quite a few rockets. So there's a whole compilation online that we put together and others put together, it's showing rockets are hard. I mean, the sheer amount of energy going through a rocket boggles the mind. So, you know, getting out of Earth's gravity well is difficult. We have a strong gravity and a thick atmosphere. And Mars, which is less than 40 percent, it's like, 37 percent of Earth's gravity and has a thin atmosphere. The ship alone can go all the way from the surface of Mars to the surface of Earth. Whereas getting to Mars requires a giant booster and orbital refilling. CA: So, Elon, as I think more about this incredible array of things that you're involved with, I keep seeing these synergies, to use a horrible word, between them. You know, for example, the robots you're building from Tesla could possibly be pretty handy on Mars, doing some of the dangerous work and so forth. I mean, maybe there's a scenario where your city on Mars doesn't need a million people, it needs half a million people and half a million robots. And that's a possibility. Maybe The Boring Company could play a role helping create some of the subterranean dwelling spaces that you might need. EM: Yeah. CA: Back on planet Earth, it seems like a partnership between Boring Company and Tesla could offer an unbelievable deal to a city to say, we will create for you a 3D network of tunnels populated by robo-taxis that will offer fast, low-cost transport to anyone. You know, full self-driving may or may not be done this year. And in some cities, like, somewhere like Mumbai, I suspect won't be done for a decade. EM: Some places are more challenging than others. CA: But today, today, with what you've got, you could put a 3D network of tunnels under there. EM: Oh, if it’s just in a tunnel, that’s a solved problem. CA: Exactly, full self-driving is a solved problem. To me, there’s amazing synergy there. With Starship, you know, Gwynne Shotwell talked about by 2028 having from city to city, you know, transport on planet Earth. EM: This is a real possibility. The fastest way to get from one place to another, if it's a long distance, is a rocket. It's basically an ICBM. CA: But it has to land -- Because it's an ICBM, it has to land probably offshore, because it's loud. So why not have a tunnel that then connects to the city with Tesla? And Neuralink. I mean, if you going to go to Mars having a telepathic connection with loved ones back home, even if there's a time delay... EM: These are not intended to be connected, by the way. But there certainly could be some synergies, yeah. CA: Surely there is a growing argument that you should actually put all these things together into one company and just have a company devoted to creating a future that’s exciting, and let a thousand flowers bloom. Have you been thinking about that? EM: I mean, it is tricky because Tesla is a publicly-traded company, and the investor base of Tesla and SpaceX and certainly Boring Company and Neuralink are quite different. Boring Company and Neuralink are tiny companies. CA: By comparison. EM: Yeah, Tesla's got 110,000 people. SpaceX I think is around 12,000 people. Boring Company and Neuralink are both under 200 people. So they're little, tiny companies, but they will probably get bigger in the future. They will get bigger in the future. It's not that easy to sort of combine these things. CA: Traditionally, you have said that for SpaceX especially, you wouldn't want it public, because public investors wouldn't support the craziness of the idea of going to Mars or whatever. EM: Yeah, making life multi-planetary is outside of the normal time horizon of Wall Street analysts. (Laughs) To say the least. CA: I think something's changed, though. What's changed is that Tesla is now so powerful and so big and throws off so much cash that you actually could connect the dots here. Just tell the public that x-billion dollars a year, whatever your number is, will be diverted to the Mars mission. I suspect you'd have massive interest in that company. And it might unlock a lot more possibility for you, no? EM: I would like to give the public access to ownership of SpaceX, but I mean the thing that like, the overhead associated with a public company is high. I mean, as a public company, you're just constantly sued. It does occupy like, a fair bit of ... You know, time and effort to deal with these things. CA: But you would still only have one public company, it would be bigger, and have more things going on. But instead of being on four boards, you'd be on one. EM: I'm actually not even on the Neuralink or Boring Company boards. And I don't really attend the SpaceX board meetings. We only have two a year, and I just stop by and chat for an hour. The board overhead for a public company is much higher. CA: I think some investors probably worry about how your time is being split, and they might be excited by you know, that. Anyway, I just woke up the other day thinking, just, there are so many ways in which these things connect. And you know, just the simplicity of that mission, of building a future that is worth getting excited about, might appeal to an awful lot of people. Elon, you are reported by Forbes and everyone else as now, you know, the world's richest person. EM: That’s not a sovereign. CA: (Laughs) EM: You know, I think it’s fair to say that if somebody is like, the king or de facto king of a country, they're wealthier than I am. CA: But it’s just harder to measure -- So $300 billion. I mean, your net worth on any given day is rising or falling by several billion dollars. How insane is that? EM: It's bonkers, yeah. CA: I mean, how do you handle that psychologically? There aren't many people in the world who have to even think about that. EM: I actually don't think about that too much. But the thing that is actually more difficult and that does make sleeping difficult is that, you know, every good hour or even minute of thinking about Tesla and SpaceX has such a big effect on the company that I really try to work as much as possible, you know, to the edge of sanity, basically. Because you know, Tesla’s getting to the point where probably will get to the point later this year, where every high-quality minute of thinking is a million dollars impact on Tesla. Which is insane. I mean, the basic, you know, if Tesla is doing, you know, sort of $2 billion a week, let’s say, in revenue, it’s sort of $300 million a day, seven days a week. You know, it's ... CA: If you can change that by five percent in an hour’s brainstorm, that's a pretty valuable hour. EM: I mean, there are many instances where a half-hour meeting, I was able to improve the financial outcome of the company by $100 million in a half-hour meeting. CA: There are many other people out there who can't stand this world of billionaires. Like, they are hugely offended by the notion that an individual can have the same wealth as, say, a billion or more of the world's poorest people. EM: If they examine sort of -- I think there's some axiomatic flaws that are leading them to that conclusion. For sure, it would be very problematic if I was consuming, you know, billions of dollars a year in personal consumption. But that is not the case. In fact, I don't even own a home right now. I'm literally staying at friends' places. If I travel to the Bay Area, which is where most of Tesla engineering is, I basically rotate through friends' spare bedrooms. I don't have a yacht, I really don't take vacations. It’s not as though my personal consumption is high. I mean, the one exception is a plane. But if I don't use the plane, then I have less hours to work. CA: I mean, I personally think you have shown that you are mostly driven by really quite a deep sense of moral purpose. Like, your attempts to solve the climate problem have been as powerful as anyone else on the planet that I'm aware of. And I actually can't understand, personally, I can't understand the fact that you get all this criticism from the Left about, \"Oh, my God, he's so rich, that's disgusting.\" When climate is their issue. Philanthropy is a topic that some people go to. Philanthropy is a hard topic. How do you think about that? EM: I think if you care about the reality of goodness instead of the perception of it, philanthropy is extremely difficult. SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink and The Boring Company are philanthropy. If you say philanthropy is love of humanity, they are philanthropy. Tesla is accelerating sustainable energy. This is a love -- philanthropy. SpaceX is trying to ensure the long-term survival of humanity with a multiple-planet species. That is love of humanity. You know, Neuralink is trying to help solve brain injuries and existential risk with AI. Love of humanity. Boring Company is trying to solve traffic, which is hell for most people, and that also is love of humanity. CA: How upsetting is it to you to hear this constant drumbeat of, \"Billionaires, my God, Elon Musk, oh, my God?\" Like, do you just shrug that off or does it does it actually hurt? EM: I mean, at this point, it's water off a duck's back. CA: Elon, I’d like to, as we wrap up now, just pull the camera back and just think ... You’re a father now of seven surviving kids. EM: Well, I mean, I'm trying to set a good example because the birthrate on Earth is so low that we're facing civilizational collapse unless the birth rate returns to a sustainable level. CA: Yeah, you've talked about this a lot, that depopulation is a big problem, and people don't understand how big a problem it is. EM: Population collapse is one of the biggest threats to the future of human civilization. And that is what is going on right now. CA: What drives you on a day-to-day basis to do what you do? EM: I guess, like, I really want to make sure that there is a good future for humanity and that we're on a path to understanding the nature of the universe, the meaning of life. Why are we here, how did we get here? And in order to understand the nature of the universe and all these fundamental questions, we must expand the scope and scale of consciousness. Certainly it must not diminish or go out. Or we certainly won’t understand this. I would say I’ve been motivated by curiosity more than anything, and just desire to think about the future and not be sad, you know? CA: And are you? Are you not sad? EM: I'm sometimes sad, but mostly I'm feeling I guess relatively optimistic about the future these days. There are certainly some big risks that humanity faces. I think the population collapse is a really big deal, that I wish more people would think about because the birth rate is far below what's needed to sustain civilization at its current level. And there's obviously ... We need to take action on climate sustainability, which is being done. And we need to secure the future of consciousness by being a multi-planet species. We need to address -- Essentially, it's important to take whatever actions we can think of to address the existential risks that affect the future of consciousness. CA: There's a whole generation coming through who seem really sad about the future. What would you say to them? EM: Well, I think if you want the future to be good, you must make it so. Take action to make it good. And it will be. CA: Elon, thank you for all this time. That is a beautiful place to end. Thanks for all you're doing. EM: You're welcome."

He's doing some definitely doing some testosterone. He looks jacked. He looks jacked, right? Yeah. But he didn't like quick quick quick at age like at 50 at age 59 in less than a year he he went from pencilet geek to uh looking like a like the rock. Yeah. Like a little miniature alpha fella. Yeah. Like like his neck got bigger than his head. Yeah. He got bigger. But then like his earlier pictures his neck's like a noodle. I support this activity. I like to see him going in this direction which is fine. And his voice dropped like two octaves. I want you to move in that direction as well. I think we can achieve this. I I I mean I should I think we can achieve gigachad. That's what people called it. Where is that guy? Bele. Uh I don't know where he is. That's like a real guy. The artist. Yeah. No. Oh, gigachad. Oh, gigachad. Yeah. I don't know if that's a real guy. It's hard to say. No, it is a real guy. It is a real guy. He's got the crazy jaw and like perfect sculpted hair. Yeah. Well, I mean, they may have exaggerated a little bit, but um but uh No, I think I think he actually just kind of looked like that in reality. Wow. Um so like like he's a pretty unique looking individual. I think we can achieve this. That guy right there, that's a real guy. That's a real dude. I always thought that was CGI. No, I think one of I think the upper right one is not him. That's not But that one to the left of that like that's real. No, that's that's artificial, bro. That's fake. That's got that uncanny valley feel to it, doesn't it? It's It's not impossible. No, no, it's not impossible to achieve, but it's not it's not possible to maintain that kind of leanness. I mean, that's like like you're you're also at that point they're he's dehydrating and all sorts of things. Oh, it's based on a real person. Yeah. Yeah. Based on, right, but it's not a real person. What does he really look like? Like those images, I think, are [ __ ] Some of them are. Is that real? Okay. That That looks real. That looks like a really jack bodybuilder. Yeah. Yeah, that looks real. Like that's achievable. But there's a few of those images where you're just like, \"What's going on here?\" Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Totally. Um Well, I mean, you see you see that guy is that is that the that's the real dude? Well, there's that that that Icelandic dude who's Thor. Oh, yeah. The guy who jumps in the frozen lakes and [ __ ] Well, the guy who played the mountain. Um Oh, that guy. That is that is like a that that is like a a mutant strong human. Yes. Like like uh he would be in like the X-Men or something, you know? He's just like not like uh and there's that you know that have you seen that meme tent and tent bag? Um you know how like it's like it's really hard to get the tent tent in Oh, right. Right. That's true. Then there's a picture of of him and his girlfriend. That's hilarious. Yeah, that's I don't know how it gets in there, you know? It's like it seems too small. But I met Brian Shaw. Brian Shaw is like the world's most powerful man. And he's almost 7 feet tall. He's 400 lb. And his his bone density is 1 in 500 million people. So there's one it's like there's like maybe 16 people. He's an enormous human being. like a legitimate giant just like that guy. But we met him. He was hanging out with us in the green room of the mother ship. It's like, okay, if this was like David and Goliath days, like this is an actual giant like the giants of the Bible. Once in a while they get a super giant person. This is a real a real one. Like not a tall skinny basketball player, like a 7 foot 400B powerliffter. Like you don't want to especially look at him. That's the guy. See if there's a photo of him standing next to like a regular human. I was trying to get There it is. That's him right there. Like there's like there's like one of him with next to standing next to Arnold and stuff and it's where and everyone everyone just looks tiny. I mean I think he's a pretty cool dude actually. Oh, Brian's very cool. Very smart, too. Unusually, you know, you expect anybody to be that big. It's got to be a [ __ ] No. Yeah. There was there's Andre the Giant who was awesome. You he was great in Princess Bride and No, he was just awesome period. Yeah. Yeah. So, we were talking about um this interview with Sam Alman and Tucker, and I was like, we should probably just talk about this on the air because it is one of the craziest interviews I think I've ever seen in my life. Yeah. Where Tucker starts bringing up this guy who was a whistleblower, whatever. A whistleblower who, you know, committed suicide, but it doesn't look like it. And and he's talking to Sam Alman about this. And Sam Alton was like, \"Are you accusing me?\" He's like, \"No, no, no. I'm not. I'm just saying I I think someone killed him. Yeah. And like And it should be investigated. Yeah. Um not just drop the case. It seems like they just dropped the case. Yeah. Yeah. But his parents think he was murdered. Yeah. Um the wires to a security camera were cut. Um blood in two rooms. Blood in two rooms. Someone else's wig was in the room. And someone else's wig. Wig. Wig. Yes. Not his wig. Not normal to have a wig laying around. Yes. Um and um and he ordered Door Dash uh right before allegedly committing suicide. Uh which uh is it seems unusual, you know? Yeah. It's like, you know, let's I'm going to order pizza on second thoughts, I'll kill myself. Uh is it seems like that's a very rapid change in mindset. It's very weird. And especially the parents have they they don't believe he committed suicide at all. Has no note or anything. No. Yeah. It seems pretty [ __ ] up. And you know, the idea that a whistleblower for an enormous AI company that's worth billions of dollars might get whacked, that's not outside the pale. I mean, it's straight out of a movie. Right out of a movie, but right out of a movie is real sometimes. Yeah. Right. Exactly. It's a little weird that I I think they should do a proper investigation. Like, what's the downside on that proper investigation? Right. No. Yeah, for sure. But the whole exchange is so bizarre. Yeah. Yeah. Sam Alman's reaction to being accused of murder is bizarre. Look, I don't know if he's guilty, but it's not possible to look more guilty. So, I'm like, or look more weird. Yeah. You know, maybe it's just his social thing. Like, maybe he's just odd with confrontation and it just goes blank, you know? But if if somebody was accusing me of killing Jamie, like if Jamie was a whistleblower and Jamie got whacked and then I'd be like, \"Wait, what are you what are you are you accusing me of killing my friend?\" Like, \"What the [ __ ] are you talking about?\" I would I would be a little bit more I rate. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. You know, it would be I would be a little upset. Yeah. It'd be like Well, you'd be like, you'd certainly in insist on a thorough investigation. Yeah. As opposed to trying to sweep it under the rug. Yeah. I wouldn't assume that he got that he committed suicide. I would be suspicious. If Tucker was telling me that aspect of the story, I'd be like, \"That does seem like a murder. [ __ ] We should look into this.\" I mean, all signs point to it being a murder. Not not saying, you know, Tim Molvin had anything to do with the murder, but uh blood in two rooms. It's blood in two rooms. Like, yeah, there's the wires to the security camera and the door dash being ordered right before suicide. No suicide note. his parents think uh he was murdered and um the people that I know who knew him said he was not suicidal. So I'm like this why would you jump to the conclusion parents sued the uh landlord? They sued the son's landlord alleged the owners and the managers of their son's San Francisco apartment building were part of a widespread cover up of his death. The landlord Yeah. There's a bunch of weird They said there was like packages missing from the building. Some people said they saw packages still being delivered and all a sudden they all disappeared. Huh. But that could be people steal people's packages all the time. The porch pirate situation. Yeah. Yeah. Says they failed to safeguard. Also, I mean, the amount of trauma those poor parents have gone through with their son dying like that. I mean, it must God bless them. And how could they stay sane after something like that? They're probably they're so griefstricken. Who knows what they believe at this point. Yeah. It should have asked if Epson killed himself. Yeah, that's the the Cash Mattel thing. Cash Mattel Dan Bonino trying to convince everybody of that. Like, okay. The guards weren't there and the cameras stopped working and um you know, the guards were asleep. The cameras weren't working. He had a a giant steroided up bodybuilder guy that he was sharing a cell with that was a murderer who was a bad cop. Like, all of it's kind of nuts. All of it's kind of nuts like that he would just kill himself rather than reveal all of his billionaire friends. Yeah. And then did you see Tim Dylan talking to Chris Cuomo about this? I did. He liked the idea. Chris Cromo just looked so stupid. Tim just listed off all the Tim just and he's like I agree it is strange. Like of course it's strange Chris. Jesus Christ. You can't just go with the tide. You got to think things through. And if you think that one through, you're like, I don't think he killed himself. Nobody does. You'd have to work for an intelligence agency to think he killed himself. It does. It does seem unlikely. It seems highly unlikely. Highly, highly unlikely. All roads point to murder. Yes. Point to they had to get rid of him because he knew too much. Whatever the [ __ ] he was doing, whatever kind of an asset he was, whatever thing he was up to, you know, was apparently very effective. Yes. And a lot of people are compromised. You see, your boy Bill Gates is now saying climate change is not a big deal. Like, relax everybody. I know I scared the [ __ ] out of you for the last decade and a half, but ah, we're going to be fine. Yeah. I mean, you know, as was I was saying just before coming into the studio with, you know, it like every day there's some crazy wild new thing that's happening. It's It feels like reality is accelerating. It's every day. And Every day it's like more and more ridiculous to the point where the simulation is more and more undeniable. Yeah. Yeah. It really feels like simulation, you know? It's like, come on. What are the odds that this could be the case? Are you paying attention at all to Three Atlas? Are you watching the the comet? Yeah. Whatever it is. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I mean, one thing I can say is like, look, I if if I was aware of any evidence of aliens, um, you Joe, you have my word. I will come on your show and I will reveal it on the show. Okay. Yeah, that's a good deal. Yeah, it's pretty good. I'll believe you. Yeah, thank you. I I'll stick I keep my you know, keep my promises. So, um All right. I'll hold you to that. Yeah. Yeah. And and I'm never committing suicide to be clear. I don't think you would either. So, on camera, guys, I am never committing suicide ever. If someone says you committed suicide, I will fight tooth and nail. I will fight tooth and nail. I will I will not believe it. I will not believe it. The thing about the three eye atlas is it's a hell of a name actually. Yeah, it's a third eye sounds like third eye or something. Yeah, it does. Three eye is third. It's only the third interstellar object that's detected. Okay. Yeah. Obias. Yeah. Alo was on the podcast a couple days ago talking about it. Yeah. It could be. I don't know. But I apparently today they're saying that it's changed course. Um, did you see that, Jamie? Avi said something today. I'll send it to you. Um, uh, I know it's on Reddit. Here you go, Jamie. I'll send it to you right now. Um, it's fascinating. It's fascinating also because it's made almost entirely of nickel, whatever it is. And the only way that exists, uh, here is, uh, industrial alloys apparently. Um um most no there are there are there are definitely uh comets that and asteroids that are made primarily of nickel in fact. Yeah. So the the places where um you mine nickel on earth is actually where there was an asteroid or comet that hit earth that was a nickel rich uh you know nickel rich nickel rich rich deposit. Yeah that's that's that's it's coming. Those are from impacts. You definitely didn't want to be there at the time because anything would have been obliterated. Right. Um, but that's that's where the the sources of nickel and cobalt are these days. So, this is Ovio Lope. A few hours ago, the first hint of non-gravitational acceleration that something other than gravity is affecting its acceleration, meaning something is affecting its trajectory beyond gravity was indicated. Interesting. Um so it's mostly nickel very little iron which uh he was saying uh is on earth only exists in alloys but whatever you know you're dealing with another planet there this there are there are there are cases where there's very nickel richch asteroids meteorites that heavy that something from space. Yeah it it's only yeah it doesn't mean it'll be a very sort of heavy spaceship if you make it all out of nickel. Oh yeah. And [ __ ] huge. The size of Manhattan and all nickel. That's kind of nuts. Yeah, that's a heavy spaceship. That's a real problem if it hits. Uh yes. No, it would like obliterate a continent type of thing. Um maybe maybe worse. Probably kill most of human life. Um if not all of us. I haven't depends on what the the total mass is. But um there's I mean the thing is like in the fossil record there are um you know there's like arguably arguably five major extinction events. um like the biggest one of which is the Perine extinction uh where um almost all life was eliminated. That that actually occurred over several million several million years. Um the there's the Jurassic. I think Jurassic is I think that one's pretty definitively an asteroid. Um and um but there's but there's been five major extinction events, but um but what they don't count are really the ones that merely take out a continent. So merely Yeah. cuz that that because those don't really show up on the fossil record, you know, right? Um so unless it's enough to cause a you know mass extinction event throughout Earth, it it doesn't show up, you know, in a fossil record that's uh 200 million years old. Um so the uh yeah but but there have been many um many impacts that would have sort of destroyed all life on you know let's say half of North America or something like that. there many such impacts through the course of history. Yeah. And there's nothing we can do about it right now. Yeah. There was one that um hits there was a one that hit Siberia and destroyed I think um few hundred square miles. Oh, that's the Tungusa. Yeah. That's the one from the 1920s, right? Yeah. Yeah. That's the one that coincides with that meteor that uh comet storm that we go through every June and every November that they think is responsible for that younger dest. Yeah. Yeah, all that shit's crazy. Um, thank you before we go any further for letting us have a tour of SpaceX and letting us be there for the rocket launch. One of the absolute coolest things I've ever seen in my life. And we we've we were we thought it was only like I thought it was a half a mile. Jamie's like it was a mile away. Turned out it's almost two miles away. And you feel it in your chest. Yeah. It's you have to wear earplugs and you feel it in your chest and it's 2 miles away. It was [ __ ] amazing. And then to go with you up into the command center and to watch all the Starlink satellites with all the different cameras and all in real time as it made its way all the way to Australia. How many minutes? Like 35 40 minutes. Yeah. Wild it touchdown in Australia. Yeah. [ __ ] crazy. It was amazing. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely amazing. The starship's awesome. Um, and anyone can go watch the launch actually. So, you can just go to um, South Padre Island, get has a great view of the launch. Um, so it's like where a lot of spring breakers go. Um, but um, but we'll be flying pretty frequently um, out of Starbase in South Texas. And we we formally incorporated it as a city. So, it's it's actually a legally an actual legal city, Starbase, Texas. Um, it's not that often you hear like, hey, we made a city, you know. Um, that used to be like the like in in the old days like a startup would be you go and gather a bunch of people and say, \"Hey, let's go make a town.\" Literally, that was like that would have been startups in in in the old days. Um, or a country. Yeah. Or a country. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Actually, if you tried doing that today, there'd be a real problem. Yeah. That things are so much so much set in stone on the country front these days. You might pull it off. You might be able to pull it off. If you got a a solid island, you might be able to pull it off. You know, it's probably, you know, like like at owns lai. Yeah, you could probably if you put if you put enough effort into it, you could make a new country. This is one of the different ones. This is one of the ones that you catch, right? Or is that one? Yeah, that that's the booster. So that's the super heavy booster. Uh so that's the one with the booster's got 33 engines. Um that that uh um and it's you know by version four that will have about 10,000 tons of thrust. Um you know right now it's about 7 8,000 tons of thrust. Um, that's that's the largest flying object ever made. I had to explain to someone. They were going, \"Why do they blow up all the time if he's so smart?\" Because there was there was this [ __ ] idiot on television. Some guy was being interviewed and they were talking about you. And he goes, \"Oh, I think he's a fuckwit.\" And he goes, \"He's a fuckwit.\" And he goes, \"Why you say he's [ __ ] Oh, his rockets keep blowing up.\" And someone said, \"Yeah, well, why do his rockets blow?\" And I had to explain. Yeah. Because it's the only way you find out what the tolerances are. You have to you have to a few corners of the box. So, so like so when you do a new uh rocket development program, um you you have to uh do what's called uh you know, exploring the limits, the corners of the box where you say it's like you worst case this, worst case that um to figure out um uh where where the limits are. So uh you blow up, you know, not not admittedly in the development process sometimes blows up accidentally. Um but but we intentionally subject it to uh uh you know a flight regime that is much worse than what we expect in normal flight so that when we put people on board or valuable cargo it doesn't blow up. Um so um so so for example for the the flight that you saw we we actually deliberately took um heat shield tiles off the the the ship the off of Starship in in some of the worst locations to say okay if we lose a heat shield tile here is it is it catastrophic or is it not? Um and we we nonetheless uh Starship was able to do a soft landing um in uh in the Indian Ocean just uh west of Australia. Um which as and it got there from Texas in like I don't know 354 minutes type of thing. So So it landed even though you put it through this situation where it has compromised shield. it it had an an an an unusually we we we brought it in hot like an an extra hot trajectory uh with missing tiles um to see if it would still make it to a soft landing which it did. Now I I should point out it did have there were some holes that were burnt into it. Um but it's it was robust enough to land despite having some holes burnt you know that that you know cuz it's coming it's coming in like a blazing meteor. You can see you can see the real time video. Well, tell me the speed again because the the speed was bananas. You were talking about Yeah, it's like 17,000 mph like like 25 times the speed of sound or thereabouts. So, um the uh uh so so think of it like it's it's like 12 times faster than a bullet from an assault rifle. You know, bullet from assault rifles around Mach 2 and it's just and it's huge. Yeah. Yeah. Or or if you compare it to like a bullet from a um you know a 45 or or 9 mil which is subsonic that's you know it it'll be about 30 times faster than a bullet from a handgun. 30 times faster than a bullet from a handgun and it's the size of a skyscraper. Yes. Yeah. That's fast. It's so wild. It's so wild to see, man. It It's uh It's so exciting. This the factor is so exciting too because like genuinely no [ __ ] I felt like I was witnessing history. I felt like it was a scene in a movie where someone had expectations and they like what are they doing? They're building rockets. And you go there and as we were walking through Jamie, you could speak to this too. Didn't you have the feeling where you're like oh this is way bigger than I thought it was. This is huge. Awesome. Gigantic. [ __ ] crazy. That's what she said. the ah the amount of rockets you're making. I don't know if you tent back. Gig Chad in the house. This is way big. It's a giant metal dick. You're [ __ ] [ __ ] the universe with your giant metal dick. That's I mean, yeah, it is. It is very big. And the sheer numbers of them that you guys are making. And then this is a version and you have a new updated version that's coming soon. And what is the It's a It's a little longer. Um more pointy. Uh it's the same amount of pointy. Um but the there's it's it's got a bit more length. Um the the interstage, you see that that interstage section with kind of like the grill area. Mhm. Um that's uh that's now integrated with the boost stage. Um so uh we do um what's called hot staging. Uh where we light the ship engines while it's still attached to the booster. So the boost the booster engines are still thrusting. is still it's it's uh you know it's still being pushed forward by the booster of the ship. Uh but then we light the ship engines and the ship engines actually pull away from the booster even though the booster engines are still firing. Whoa. Um so it's blasting flame through uh that that grill section but we integrate that grill section into uh the boost stage with the next uh version of the rocket. Um and uh and explosion in the rocket will have the Raptor 3 engines which are a huge improvement. Um you may you may have seen them in the lobby because we got like the Raptor 1, two, and three. And you can see the dramatic improvement in simplicity. Um we should probably put a plaque there to also show how much the we reduced the weight uh the cost and the and improved the efficiency and the uh thrust. So the Raptor 3 uh has uh you know almost twice the thrust of Raptor Raptor 1. Wow. So you see Raptor 3. It looks like it looks like it's got parts missing. Right. And how many It's very very clean. How many of them are on the rocket? There's 33 on the on the booster. Whoa. Um and and each of each Raptor engine is producing twice as much thrust as all four engines on a 747. Wow. So that engine is smaller than a 747 engine, but is producing, you know, um you know, almost 10 times the thrust of a 747 engine. Um so extremely high power to weight ratio. Um and um and so when there's 33 of them you when you so when you're designing these you get to Raptor one you see its efficiency you see where you can improve it you get to Raptor 2 how many how far can you scale this up with just the same sort of technology with propellant and ignition and engines like how much further can you I mean we're pushing the limits of physics here um so um and and really in order to to make a a fully reusable orbital rocket which no one has succeeded in doing uh yet including including us. Um but but uh Starship is the first time that there is a design for a rocket where where full and rapid reusability is actually possible. So it was not there's not there's not even been a design before where it was possible. Certainly not a design that that that got made any hardware at all. Um just we just we just live we live on a planet uh where the gravity uh is is is quite high like earth's gravity is quite really quite quite high. Um um and if the gravity was even 10 or 20% uh higher uh we'd be stuck on Earth forever. Um like we yeah we could not use certainly couldn't use conventional rockets. You'd have to like blow yourself off the surface with like a nuclear bomb or something crazy. Um so but on the other hand if if Earth's gravity was just a little lower like even 10 20% lower it then uh getting to orbit would be easy. So it's like it's like it's like this if this was a video game it's set to like maximum difficulty but not impossible. Okay. Um so that's that's where we have um here. So it's it's not as though um others have uh ignored the concept of reusability. they've just uh concluded that it was too difficult to achieve. And we've been working at on on this for a long time at at SpaceX. Um and um you know, I'm the chief engineer of the company. Um although I should say that that uh you know, we have an extremely talented engineering team. I think we've got the best uh rocket engineering team that has ever been assembled. Um uh it's it's an honor to work with such such incredible people. Um so uh so so it's fair to say that you know we have not yet succeeded in creating in achieving full reusability but we at last have a rocket uh where full reusability is possible. Um and I think I think we'll achieve it next year. So um uh that's a that's a really big deal. And the reason the reason that's that's such a big deal is that full reusability um uh drops the cost of access to space by a hundred um maybe even more than 100 actually. So could be like a thousand. The you can think of it like any mode of transport. Like imagine if aircraft were were not reusable. Like you flew somewhere, you throw the plane like like imagine if like the way the way conventional rockets work is it would be like if you had an airplane and and and instead of landing at your destination, you parachute out um and the plane crashes somewhere and you land at your desk and you and you land on a parachute at your destination. Now that would be a very expensive trip and you and you'd need another plane to get back. Okay. Um, but that's how the other rockets in the world work. Um, now the SpaceX Falcon rocket is the only one that is is there that is at least mostly reusable. You've se you've seen the Falcon rocket, you know, land. We've now done over 500 landings of of the SpaceX rocket of the of the Falcon 9 rocket. Um and um and and this year um you know we we'll deliver probably I don't know somewhere between 2200 and 2500 tons to orbit um with with the Falcon 9 uh Falcon Heavy rockets uh not counting anything for from Starship. Um and this is mostly Starlink. Yes, mostly Starling, but we launch uh many other we even launch our competitors on um competitors to Starink on on Falcon 9. We charge them the same price. Pretty fair. Um uh but uh SpaceX this year will deliver um roughly 90% of all Earth mass to orbit. Wow. Um and then of the remaining 10% um most of that is done by China. And then the then the remaining kind of roughly 4% is uh everyone else in the world including our America uh domestic competitors. You know um it's kind of incredible how many things are in space like how many things are floating above us now? There's a lot of things. Yeah. Is there though? Right. But is there a saturation point where we're going to have problems with all these different satellites that are um I think as long as the satellites are um maintained uh there's there it'll be fine. This space is very roomy. Um it's like you can think of um like space as being concentric shells of the surface of the earth. So, um, you know, there's there's it's the surface of the earth, but but there's it's a series much larger. Yeah. It's like a series of concentric trails. Um, and think of an Airstream trailer flying around up there. There's a lot of room for air streams. Yeah. I mean, imagine Yeah. If there just a few thousand airirstreams um on on Earth. Yeah. What are the odds that they'd hit each other? You know, they wouldn't be very crowded. No. And then you got to go bigger. Yeah. Because you're dealing with far above Earth. Hundreds of miles above Earth. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, it's the um but the goal of SpaceX is to get rocket technology to the point where we can extend life beyond Earth and that we can establish a self-sustaining city on Mars. Uh a permanent base on the moon. That would be very cool. I mean, imagine if we had like a, you know, moon base alpha where there's like a permanent science base on the moon. That would be pretty dope. Or at least a tourist trap. I mean, a lot of people be willing to go to the moon for just for a tour. That's for sure. We could probably pay for our space program with that, you know, probably. Yeah. Well, because it's like if if you if you could go to the moon with and and safely, uh I think we'd get a lot of people uh would would pay for that, you know. Oh, 100%. After the first year, after nobody died for like Yeah. Just make sure. Exactly. Are you going to come back? Yeah. Because like that submarine, they they had a bunch of successful launches in that private submarine before it imploded and killed everybody. That was not a good design. Obviously, it was a very bad design. Terrible design. And the engineers said it would not withstand the pressure of those depths. Like there was a lot of whistleblowers in that company too. Yeah. Um they they they made that out of uh carbon fiber which is it doesn't make any sense because um you actually need you need to be dense to go down. Um in any case, just make it out of steel. If you make it out of uh sort of just, you know, a big steel casting, that's that's you you'll be safe and nothing. Why would they make it out of carbon fiber then? Is it cheaper? Um I think they think carbon fiber sounds cool or something. But uh it does sound cool. It it sounds cool, but um because it's such it's such low density, you actually actually have to add extra mass to go down because it's it's low density. But if you just have a giant, you know, hollow ball bearing, uh you're going to be fine. Speaking of carbon fiber, did you check out my unplugged Tesla out there? Yeah, it's cool. Pretty sick, right? Yeah. Have you guys ever thought about doing something like that? like having like an AMG division of Tesla where you do like custom stuff. Um I think it's best to leave that to the custom shops. Uh you know we're we're like Tesla's focus is autonomous cars. Um you know building kind of futuristic autonomous cars. Um so um like I think it's we want the future to look like the future. Um, so the did like did you see like our designs for like the sort of the robotic bus? It looks pretty cool. The robotic bus is also being totally auton but it looks it looks cool. It's it's very art deco. It's it's like it's like futuristic art deco. Um, and um, it it does it like I think we want to change the aesthetic over time. You don't want the aesthetic to be constant over time. You want to evolve the aesthetic. Um, so um, you know, like my like I have a son who's he's like, you know, he's he's he's like even more autistic than me and um and, uh, but he's he has these great observations. Who is this? A Saxon. He has these great observations in the world uh because he's he just views the world through a different lens than than most people. Um and he was like, \"Dad, why does the world look like it's 2015?\" And I'm like, \"Damn, the world does look like it's 2015.\" Like the aesthetic has not evolved since 2015. Oh, that's what it looks like. Yeah. Oh, wow. That's pretty cool. Oh, yeah. That's like like You'd want to see that going down the road, you know? Yeah. You'd be like, \"Okay, this is we're in the future.\" You know, it doesn't look like 2015. What is that ancient science fiction movie? Like one of the first science fiction movies ever. Is it Metropolis? Is that what it is? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That looks like it belongs in Metropolis. Yeah. Yeah. It's a futuristic art deco. All right. Yeah. Well, that's cool that you're concentrating on the aesthetic. I mean, that's kind of the whole deal with Cybertruck, right? Like, it didn't have to look like that. No, it it I just wanted to have something that looked really different. Is it a pain in the ass for people to get it insured because it's all solid steel and um I hope it's not too much. I you know Tesla does offer insurance so people can always get it get it insured at Tesla. Um well but the like it is the form does follow a function in the case of the cybert truck because um as you demonstrated with with your armorpiercing arrow um because if you shot that arrow at a regular truck I mean it exactly you would have found your arrow in the wall. Yeah. Um, you know, it would very least it would have buried into one of the seats. Yeah. Yeah. It's but like you could you could definitely make uh get enough of bow velocity and and the right the right arrow would go through both doors of a regular truck and and and land on the wall. If there was a clear shot between both doors, it probably would have passed right through. Exactly. Um but but you know the the arrow shattered on the cybert truck cuz it's it's ultra hard uh stainless. Mhm. Um, so, um, and I thought it' be I thought it'd be cool to have a, you know, a truck that is bulletproof to a subsonic projectile. Um, so, um, you know, especially in this day and age, you know, like as as a if, if the apocalypse happens, you're going to want to have a bulletproof truck, you know. Um, so so then because because it's made of ultra hot stainless, it's you can't just stamp the the panels. You can't just put in a stamping press because it breaks the press. So, so in order to actually, so it has to has to be planer um because it's so difficult to bend it because it breaks the machine that bends it. Um that's why that's why it's it's it's it's so planer and and it's not uh you know it's it's because it's bulletproof steel is the So it is like boxy as opposed to like curved and Yeah. You just in order to make in order to make like the curved shapes, you you you take you take uh uh basically mild steel like um anneal thin and thin anneal in a regular truck or car. The you take you take mild thin anneal steel, you put it in a stamping press and it just sm it just smooshes it and makes it to whatever the shape whatever shape you want. But the Cybert truck is made made of ultra hard stainless. Um and and and so you can't stamp it because it would break the stamping press. So it even bending it is hard. So even to bend it to uh its current position, we have to way overbend it. Um and and so it gets so that when it springs back, it's in in the right position. Um, so it's uh I don't know like I I think if you want to like I think it's it's it's a unique aesthetic. Um, and you say, \"Well, what's cool about a truck?\" Trucks are trucks are like should be I don't know manly. They should be macho, you know, and bulletproof is maximum macho macho. Are you married to that shape now? Like is it can you do anything to change it? Like as you get further like I know you guys updated the three and the Y. Did you update the Y as well? Yes, the the three and the Y uh are updated. Um you know, there's like a um there's there's a a screen in the back for the kid that the kids can watch, for example, in the new 3 and Y. Um uh so in the new Y, um there's, you know, it's it's an there's there's there's like hundreds of improvements. Like we keep improving the car. Um and even the Cybert truck, we you know, we keep improving it. Um but um you know I wanted to just do something that that looked unique and and the cybert truck looks unique and has unique functionality and there was and it was like there were three things as I report like let's make it bulletproof. Uh let's uh make it faster than a Porsche 911. Uh, and we actually cleared the quarter mile. The Cybert truck, the the uh can uh clear a quarter mile while towing a Porsche 911 faster than a Porsche 911. Um, it can out tow an F350 diesel. Really? Yes. What is the tow limitations? I mean, we could tow like a, you know, a 747 in that with a cy. Cybert truck is an insanely like it is an it is alien technology. Okay. Um cuz it it shouldn't be possible to be uh that big and that fast. Uh that doesn't it's like an elephant that runs as as like a cheetah. Yeah. Because it's 0 to 60 in less than 3 seconds, right? Yes. Yeah. And it's enormous. What does it weigh? Like 7,000 lbs. Uh yeah, there's different configurations, but it's about that. Uh it's a beast. Yeah. Um so and it's and it's got it's got four-wheel steering. So the the rear wheel steer, too. So it's got a it's got a very tight turning radius. Yeah. We noticed that we when we drove one to Star Base. Yeah. Very tight turning radius. Yeah. Pretty sick. Yeah. Are you still doing the Roadster? Yes. Eventually, we're getting close to demonstrating the prototype and I think this will be I I I I one thing I can guarantee is that this product demo will be unforgettable. Unforgettable. How so? Whether it's good or bad, it will be unforgettable. Um, can you say more? What do you mean? Well, you know, my friend Peter Teal, um, you know, uh, once reflected that the future was supposed to have flying cars, but we don't have flying cars. So, you're going to be able to fly? Well, I mean, uh, I think if Peter wants a flying car, we should should be able to buy one. So, you are you actively considering making an electric flying car? Is this like a real thing? Well, we have to see in the in the demo. So, when you do this, like are are you going to have a retractable wing? Like, what is the idea behind this? Don't be sly. Come on. I I I can't I can't uh do the unveil before the unveil. Um but um tell me off air then. I I I it look I I think it has a shot at being the most memorable um product unveil ever. It has a shot. And when do you plan on doing this? What's the goal? Uh hopefully before the end of the year. Really? Before the end of this year. This is I mean we're in a couple months. Hopefully in a couple months. Um you know we need to make sure that it works. Uh like this is some crazy crazy technology we got in this car. Crazy technology. Crazy crazy. So different than what was previously announced and Yes. And is that why you haven't released it yet? Cuz you keep [ __ ] with it. It has crazy technology. Okay. Like is it even a car? I'm not sure. It's like it looks like a car. Let's just put this way. It it's it's crazier than anything James Bond. If you took all the James Bond cars and combined them, it's crazier than that. Very exciting. I don't know what to think of that. I don't know. It's a limited amount of information I'm drawing from here. Jamie's very suspicious over there. Look at him. Excited. I'm interested. It's still going to be the same. Well, you know what? I mean, if if you want to if you want to come a little before the uh the unveil, I can show it to you 100%. Yeah, let's go. Yeah. Um it's uh it's kind of crazy all the different things that you're involved in simultaneously and you know we talked about this before your time management but I I really don't understand it. I don't understand how you can be paying attention to all these different things simultaneously. Starlink, SpaceX, Tesla, boring company X you're tweet you [ __ ] tweet or post rather all day long. Well, it's more like I'm I'm I could hop in for like two minutes and then hop out, you know. But I mean, just the fact that you could do bathroom break or whatever, you know, I can't do that. Um if I hop in, I start scrolling and I start looking around. Next thing you know, I've lost an hour. Yeah. Um so, no, it's for me it's it's a couple minutes time usually. It's once in a Sometimes I guess it's half an hour, but usually I'm I'm I'm in for a few minutes then out of of you know, posting something on X. Uh, you know, it's I do sometimes feel like it's sometimes like that that meme of the guy who's like who drops the grenade and leaves the room. That's been me more than once on on X. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, for sure. Um, it's got to be fun, though. It's got to be fun to know that you essentially disrupted the entire social media chain of command because there was a there was a very clear thing that was going on with social media. The government had infiltrated it. They were censoring speech and until you bought it, we really didn't know the extent of it. We kind of assumed that there was something going on. Yeah. We had no idea that they were actively involved in censoring actual real news stories, real data, real scientists, real professors silenced, expelled, kicked off the platform. Yeah. Wild. Yeah. Yeah. For telling the truth. For telling the truth. And I'm sure you've also because I sent it to you that chart that shows uh young kids, teenagers identifying as trans and non-binary literally stops dead when you bought Twitter and starts falling off a cliff when people are allowed to have rational discussions now and actually talk about it. Yes. Yeah. Um Yeah. Yeah, I mean I I said at the time like I think that like the the like the reason for acquiring Twitter is because um it was it it was c it was causing destruction at a civilizational level. Um it was um I mean I posted I tweeted on on Twitter at the time that um it it is um you know it's it's uh worm tongue for the world. um you know like Worm Tongue from Lord of the Rings uh where he would just sort of like whisper these you know terrible things to the king so the king would believe these things that weren't true um and and um unfortunately uh Twitter really got it got like the the the woke mob essentially they controlled Twitter um and they were pushing uh a nihilistic anti-vilizational mind virus to the world. Um, and you can see the results of that mind virus on the streets of San Francisco, uh, where, you know, downtown San Francisco looks like a zombie apocalypse. Um, you know, it's it's bad. Um, so we don't want the whole world to be a zombie apocalypse. Um, but that's uh that that that was essentially they were pushing this very negative, nihilistic, untrue worldview on the world and it was causing a lot of damage. Um, so the stunning thing about it is how few people course corrected. A bunch of people woke up and realized what was going on. People that were all on board with like woke ideology in maybe 2015 or 16 and then and then eventually it comes to affect them or they see it in their workplace or they see and they're like, \"Whoa, whoa, whoa, we got to stop this.\" Bunch of people did, but a lot of people never course corrected. Yeah. Um, a lot of a lot of people didn't course correct, but um, but it's gone directionally in it's gone it's it's directionally correct like you mentioned like the like the massive spike in in kids identifying as trans and then that that spike dropping um after the the Twitter acquisition. I think that um simply allowing the truth to be told um was that just shedding sun sunlight is the best disinfectant as they say and just allowing sunlight um kills the virus and it also changed the benchmark for all the other platforms. Yes, you can't just openly censor people and all the other platforms and X is available. So everybody else had a So like Facebook announced they were changing YouTube announced they were changing their policies and they're kind of forced to And then blue sky doubled down. Well, like the problem is like if uh essentially the woke mind virus retreated to woke to to blue sky. Yeah. Um but it's where they're just a self-reinforcing lunatic assign. They're all just triple masked. I I was I was totally watching this exchange on a blue sky where someone said that they're just trying to be zen about something and then someone a moderator immediately chimed in and why don't you try to stop being racist against Asians by saying something zen by saying I'm trying to be zen about something. They were accusing that person of being racist towards Asians. Yeah. It's it's just it's just everyone's a hall monitor over there. the worst hall monitor. A virgin like incel. They're all home monitors trying to rat on each other. Yeah, it's fascinating. And then people say, \"I'm leaving for blue sky like Stephen King.\" And then a couple weeks later, he's back on X. Just like, \"Fuck it. It's there's no one over there. It's all a bunch of crazy people. You can only stay in the asylum for so long. Like, all right, this this is not good.\" They all bail. Yeah. Yeah. Threads is kind of like that, too. Threads is I' I've been on threads as is it? Well, what happens is if you go on Instagram, every now and then it'll something really stupid will pop up on threads like what the [ __ ] and it shows it to you on Instagram and then I'll click on that and then I'll go to threads and it's like you see posts with like 25 likes like famous people like 50 like it's it's down but the people that post on there they're finding that there's very little push back from insane ideology so they go there and they spit out nonsense and very few people jump in to argue. you. Yeah. Um, very weird, very weird place. I mean, I can generally get the vibe of like what's taking off by seeing what's showing up on X cuz that's the public town square still. Um, and uh or or uh you know what what links show up in group texts, you know, if I'm in group chat with friends, like where where what what links are showing up? That's what I try to do now. Only get stuff that shows up in my group text because that keeps me productive. So, I only check if someone's like, \"Dude, what the fuck?\" like, \"All right, what the [ __ ] Let me check it out.\" If there's something that's crazy enough that your it'll it'll end with the group chat, but there's always something. That's what's nuts. There's always some new law that's passed, some new insane thing that California is doing. And it's like like a giant chunk of it's happening in California. The most preposterous things that I get. Yeah. And then you got Gavin Newsome who's running around saying we all have California derangement syndrome. He's just like ripping off Trump derangement and calling it California derangement. I was like, \"No, no, no, no, no, no. The the [ __ ] How many corporations have left California?\" It's crazy. Hundreds. Hundreds, right? Hundreds. That's not good. Chick I mean, not Chick-fil-A. I mean, uh I think In-N-Out left. Yeah. In and Outlift. They moved to Tennessee. Yeah. Yeah. They're like, \"We can't do this anymore.\" Right. And it's the California company for food. It's like the greatest hamburger place ever. It's awesome. Yeah. Yeah. And no, actually speaking of like like just sort of open source and like looking at things openly like you I just like going in and out and seeing them make the burger. Yeah. It's right there. They chop the onions and they they you know it's you just see everything getting made in front of you. Yeah. It's great. Um but yeah like like it should be like how many wakeup calls do you need to say that there needs to be reform in California, you know? Well, the crazy thing that Newsome does is whenever someone brings up the problems in California, he starts rattling off all the positives. the most Fortune 500 companies, highest education. But yeah, that was all already there, right before you were governor. But but how many Fortune 500 companies have left California? And then you guys spent $ 24 billion on the homeless and it got way worse. Yes. Like the homeless population doubled or something like but like people don't understand like the homeless thing because it it sort of prays on people's empathy and I I think we should have empathy. Um and we should try to help people. Um but the the the uh the homeless industrial complex is is really it's it's it's dark man. Um it should be that that that that network of NGOs's should be called like the drug zombie farmers. Um because they they the the more homeless people and and and really like when you when you meet like you know somebody who's like totally dead inside shuffling along down the street with a with a needle dang dangling out of their leg. Homeless is the wrong word. Like the homeless implies that somebody got a little behind in their mortgage payments and if they just got a job offer, they'd be back on their feet. But someone who's I mean, you see these videos of people that are just shuffling, you know, they're on fentanyl. They're they're like, you know, taking a dump in the middle of the street, you know, and they they got like open sores and stuff. They're not like one drop offer away from getting back on their feet, right? This is not a homeless issue. Homeless is it's it's a propaganda word, right? Um so and and then the the the the you know these sort of charities uh inquiries are they they get money proportionate to the number of homeless people or or number of drug zombies. So their incentive structure is to maximize the number of drug zombies not minimize it. Um that's why they don't arrest the drug dealers because if they arrest the drug dealers the drug zombies leave. So they know who the drug dealers are. They don't arrest them on purpose. Uh because otherwise the drug zombies would leave and they would they would stop getting money from the state of California and from from all the charities. Wait a minute. So So they So they is that real? So they're in coordination with law enforcement on this? Yeah. So how do they how do they have those meetings? They're all in cahoots. Well, when you find this it's like such it's it's this is a diabolical scam. Um so uh and and San Francisco has got this tax this this gross receipts tax uh which which um it's not even on revenue, it's on old transactions which is why Stripe um and Square and and and a whole bunch of financial companies had to move out of San Francisco because it wasn't a tax on revenue, it's taxed on transactions. So if if you did like, you know, trillions of dollars transactions, it's not revenue. You're taxed on any money going through the system in San Francisco. Um so um like Jack Dorsey pointed this out and they said like that they had had to move Square from San Francisco to uh Oakland I think uh Stripe had to move from San Francisco to South San Francisco different city. Um and that money uh goes to the homeless industrial complex that that tax that was passed. Um so um so there's billions of dollars that go as you pointed out billions of dollars every year that go to uh these um non-governmental organizations that are funded by the state. Like there's it's not clear how to turn this off. Um it's a self-licking ice cream cone situation. Um so uh they get this money the money is proportionate to the number of of homeless people or or number of drug zombies essentially. Um, so they they they try to keep the that they try to actually increase because that like like in in some cases like there's it's it's somebody did an analysis when you add up all the money that's flowing, they're getting close to a million dollars per homeless per per drug zombie. It's like $900,000 or something like some crazy amount of money is is is going to these organizations. So if if so so they want to keep people just barely alive. They need to keep them in the area so they so they they get the revenue. Uh uh so and so that's why like said they don't arrest the drug dealers because otherwise the drug zombies would leave um and and and and they but but they don't want you have to have too much if they get too much drugs and they then they die. So it's they they're kept in this sort of perpetual zone of of being addicted but um but but just just barely alive. So how is this coordinated with like DAs DAs that don't prosecute people? So when they when they hire the or they push so they they fund the campaigns of the most progressive, most out there leftwing DAS, they get them into office. We've got that issue in Austin, too, by the way. You see that guy that got shot in the library? No. Yeah, I heard a guy got shot and killed in the library. I think that was just like last week or something, right? Um so some friends of mine were telling me that that like the library is unsafe. like they took their kids to the library and and there were like dangerous people in the library in Austin and I was like dangerous people in the library like that's a strange it basically got like got like uh drug zombies in drug zombies in the library. Oh Jesus. Um and that's when someone got shot. Yeah, I believe this was should be on the news. You might might be able to pull it up. Um but I think it was just in the last week or so that uh uh there was a shooting in the library in Austin. Um cuz Austin's got, you know, it's it's the most liberal part of Texas that we're in right right here. Um so suspect involved the shooting Austin Park Library Saturday is accused of another shooting at the Cap Metro bus earlier that day. According to an arrest warrant affidavit, Austin police arrested Harold Newton Keen, 55 short uh shortly after the shooting of the library, which occurred around noon. One person sustained non-life-threatening injuries in the event. Before that shooting, Keane was accused of shooting another person in a bus incident and after reportedly pointing his gun at a child. So, this is the fella down here. So, like we just have a seriously have a problem here. Um yeah, you know, so I I think one of the people might have died too that he shot. Um so, um like one of the people I think I think did bleed out. Um but either way, it's like getting shot is still bad. Um it says uh the victim told police it confronted the suspect who started to eat what appeared to be crystal methamphetamine. According to the affidavit the victim advised the suspect uh began to trip out at which time the victim exited the bus. Victim told the bus driver hit the panic button and then exited the bus when he turned around the observer. Black male was now standing at the front of the bus with the gun pointed at him. The victim advised the black male fired a single round which grazed his left hip. So he shot at that dude and then another dude got shot in the library. Fun. Yeah. I mean in the library. Yeah. You know, where you're supposed to be reading books. Um and there's a children's section in the library and says he pointed his gun at a at a kid. I mean like we do have a serious issue in the in in in America where um repeat violent offenders need to be incarcerated, right? Um, and uh, you know, you got you got cases where somebody's been arrested like 47 times, right? Like literally. Okay, that's just the number of times they were arrested, not the number of times they did things. Like most of the times they do things, they're not arrested. Um, so lay this out for people so they understand how this happens. Yeah. And and the key is like this, it prays on people's empathy. episode like if you're a good person, you want good things to happen in the world, you're like, well, we should take care of people who uh you know uh you know who are down in their luck or you know having a hard time in life. And I we should I agree. But what we shouldn't do uh is is put people who are violent drug zombies uh in public places where they can hurt other people. Um, and that's what that is what we're doing that we just saw where a a guy, you know, got shot uh shot in the library and then but even before that he shot another guy um and pointed his gun at a kid. Um that that that guy probably has like many prior arrests. Um you know there was that that that guy that that that knifed uh the Ukrainian woman Arena. Yes. Um yeah. and you know um and she was just she was just quietly on her phone and you just came up and you know gutted her basically. Wasn't there a crazy story about the judge who was involved who had previously dealt with this person was also invested in a rehabilitation center and was sending these conflict of interest. Yes. So sending people that they were charging Yeah. to a rehabilitation center instead of putting them in jail, profiting from this rehabilitation center, letting them back out on the street. Yes. Violent, insane people. And and there um in that case that I believe that judge uh has no legal law degree uh or a significant legal experience that would allow them to be a judge. They were just made a judge. That there's like you could be a judge without a law degree. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. You could just be a So I could be a judge. Yeah. Oh, exciting. Anyone? That's crazy. I thought you'd have to It's like if you want to be a doctor, you have to go to medical school. I thought if you're going to be a judge, if you're going to be appointed to a judge, you have to have proven that you have an uh excellent knowledge of the law and that you will make your decisions according to the law. That's what we assume should be. That's how you get the robe, right? You don't get the robe unless you do, you know, got to go to school to get the robe. You got to know what the law is, right? And then you're going to need to make decisions in accordance with the law based on stuff that you already know cuz you read it cuz you went to school for it. Yes. Not you just got appointed. Got vibes. You can't be just vibing as a judge. Vibing as a leftwing drudge. So you got crazy leftwing DAS. Yes. Like I should say leftwing cuz leftwing used to be normal. Yeah. Left wing just meant like like Yeah. You're like the left used to be like pro pro- free speech. Yeah. And now they're against it. It used to be like prog gay rights, pro women's right to choose, pro- minorities, pro, you know, like, yeah, like 20 years ago, I don't know, it it used to be like left would be like the the the party of empathy or like, you know, caring and being nice and that kind of thing. Um, not not the party of like crushing dissent and crushing free speech. um and uh you know crazy regulation uh and and just um and being super judgy u and calling everyone a Nazi um you know um like I think they called you and me Nazis you know oh yeah I'm a Nazi I no I have friends that are comedians that called you a Nazi and I got pissed off Oh yeah yeah yeah definitely a Nazi no because you did that thing at the My heart goes out to you everyone everyone All of them. Literally, Tim Walls, Kla Harris, every one of them did it. They all did it. Like, like h how do you point at the crowd? Yeah. How do you wave at the crowd? Do you know CNN was using a photo of me whenever I got in trouble during co from the UFC weigh-ins? And if the UFC weigh-ins, I go, \"Hey everybody, welcome to the weigh-ins.\" And so they were getting me from the side. And that was the photo that they used. Conspiracy theorist podcaster Joe Ro. Like that's what they used. Yeah. Yeah. But that's what the left is today. It's super judgy and calling everyone a Nazi and trying to suppress freedom of speech. Yeah. And eventually you run out of people to accuse because people get pissed off and they leave. Yeah. Everyone it's like it like it it no longer frankly it doesn't matter to be called racist or Nazi or whatever because still recording. It's the government man. Is it working? We're good. Okay. Okay. This thing working. Yeah. Slight issue. I'm the one that heard it. But yeah. when you uh when you text people, do you are you like keenly aware that there's a high likelihood that someone's reading your texts? Um I guess I I guess I I assume I look if if if if intelligence agencies aren't trying to read my phone, they should probably be fired. At least they get some fun memes. I got to I got to crack them up once in a while, you know. Oh, for sure. I crack them up. There's like, \"Hey guys, check it out. We've got a banger here, you know.\" So, I want to I wanted to talk to you about uh whether or not encrypted apps are really secure. Uh, no. Right. Cuz I know the Tucker thing. So, it was explained to me by a friend who used to do this, used to work for the government. It's like they can look at your signal, but what they have to do is take the information that's encrypted and then they have to decrypt it and it's very expensive. So they said he told me that for the Tucker Carlson thing when they found out that he was going to interview Putin, it costs like something like $750,000 just to decrypt his messages to find out that they did it. So it is possible to do. It's just not that easy to do. I think you should view any given messaging system as um uh not not whether it's secure or not, but but there are degrees of insecurity. So um so there's just some things that are less insecure than others. Um so um you know on on X we just rebuilt the entire messaging stack um into X what's called XChat. Yeah, that's what I wanted to ask you about. Yeah, it's cool. Um, so it's it's using uh sort of peer-to-peer uh sort of kind of a peer-to-peer based uh uh encryption system. So kind of similar to Bitcoin. Um so it's uh it's it's I think very good encryption. We're and you know we're testing it thoroughly. We're not there's there's no hooks in the X systems for advertising. So if you look look at something like WhatsApp or really any of the others, they've got they've got hooks in there for advertising. When you say hooks, what do you mean by that? Uh exactly. What do you mean biohook advertising? Um the so like WhatsApp um uh knows enough about what you're texting to show you to show you to know what ads to show you. Ah but then like that that's a massive security vulnerability. Yeah. Um because if it knows if if it's got information enough information to show you ads, it's got enough it's got that's a lot of information. Yeah. Um so they call it oh it's just don't worry about it. It's just a hook for advertising. I'm like uh okay. So somebody can just uh use that same hook to get in there and look at your messages. Um so Xhat has no hooks for advertising. Um and I'm not saying it's perfect. Uh but it's an Our goal with XChat uh is to replace what used to be the Twitter you the Twitter DM stack with a fully encrypted system uh where you can text send files uh do audio video calls um and um and it's it's you know I think it'll be the least I would call it the least insecure of any messaging system. Are you going to launch it as a standalone app or is it will always be incorporated to X? Uh we'll have both. So um so so be like signal so anybody can get it you can get get the you'll be able to just get the X chat app by itself um and like I said you could do uh texts uh audio video calls uh or send files um and there'll be a dedicated app uh which will hopefully release in a few months um but and then also integrated into the X system um the X phone people keeps talking keep Is that I have a lot on my plate man but it keeps coming up it keeps coming up where I I know I've asked you a couple times. I'm like, \"This is [ __ ] right?\" But like this one, so you're not working on I'm not working on on a on a phone. Okay. Um have you ever considered it? Has it ever popped into your head? Cuz you might be the only person that could get people off of the Apple platform. Well, I can tell you where I think things are going to go. uh which is that it's we're not going to have a phone or or in the traditional sense the what we call a phone will really be um an edge node for AI inference for for AI video inference um with uh you know with some radios to to obviously connect uh to but but essentially you'll have um uh AI on the server side commun communicating to an AI on your your device um you know formerly known as a phone uh and generating real-time video of anything that you could possibly want. Um and I think that that there won't be operating systems. There won't be apps in the future. There won't be operating systems or apps. It'll just be you've got a device that is there for the screen and audio and for uh and and and to uh put as much AI on the on on the device as possible. so as to minimize the amount of bandwidth that's needed between your edge node device or formerly known as a phone and the servers. So if there's no apps, what will people use? Like will X still exist? Will will they be email platforms or will you get everything through AI? You'll get everything through AI. Everything through AI. What will be the benefit of that as opposed to having individual apps? whatever you can think of or really whatever the AI can anticipate you might want it'll show you. That's that's that's that's my prediction for where things end up. What kind of a time frame are we talking about here? I don't know. It's pro well it's probably five or six years or something like that. So five or six years apps are like Blockbuster video pretty much and everything's run through AI. Yeah. And and there'll be um like most of what people consume in five or six years, maybe sooner than that um will be uh just AI generated content. So um you know music videos look well um there's already um you know there's people have made uh AI videos using Grock imagine and with using you know other apps as well um that are several minutes long or like 10 10 15 minutes and it's pretty coherent. Yeah, it looks good. No, it looks amazing. Yeah, it's the music is disturbing because it's my favorite music now. Like music is your is your favorite. Oh, there's AI covers. Have you ever heard any of the AI covers of 50 Cent songs in soul? No. I'm going to blow your mind. Okay. Um, this is my favorite thing to do to people. Play uh What Up Ganga. Now, this guy, if this was a real person, would be the number one music artist in the world. Okay. Everybody would be like, \"Holy [ __ ] have you heard of this guy? He's incred.\" It's like they took all of the sounds that all the artists have generated and created the most soulful potent voice and it's sung in a way that I don't even know if you could do because you would have to breathe in and out of reps here. Put the headphones on. Put the headphones on real quick. You got to listen to this. It'll It's going to blow you away for listeners. We got to cut it out. Yeah, we we'll cut it out for the listeners. But amazing, right? Amazing. And they do like every one of his hits all through this AI generated soulful artist. It's [ __ ] incredible. I played in the green room. So people that are like, I don't want to hear AI music. I'm like, just listen to this. And they're like, god damn it. [ __ ] incredible. I mean, I it's going to get only going to get better from here. Yeah. Only going to get better. And Ron White was telling me about this joke that he was working on that he couldn't get to work. He's like, I got this joke I've been working on. He goes, I just threw it in a chat GPT. I said, \"Tell me what what would be funny about this.\" And he goes, \"It listed like five different examples of different ways he can go.\" He's like, \"Hold on a second. Tighten it up. Make it make it funnier. Make it more like this. Make it more like that.\" And it did that like instantaneously. And and and then he was in the green room. He was like, \"Holy [ __ ] we're fucked.\" He's like, he goes, \"It better joke than me in 20 minutes. I've been working on that joke for a month.\" Yeah. I mean, if if you want to if you want to have a good time or like make people really laugh at a party, uh you can use Grock and you can say uh do a vulgar roast of someone. Um and Grock is going to it's going to be an epic vulgar roast. You can even say like take a picture of like make a vulgar roast of this person based on their appearance of of people at the party. So take a photo of them. Yeah. Just literally point the camera at them and now do a vulgar to this person and and and and then but then keep saying no no make it even more vulgar and use forbidden words even more and just keep repeating even more vulgar eventually it's like holy [ __ ] you know it's it's it's like I mean it's trying to jam a rocket up your ass like and and and have it explode and it's and it's like you're you're it's it's like it's like it's next level. It's going to get beyond [ __ ] belief. That's what's crazy is that it keeps getting better. Like one of the things remember when we ran into each other they just keep getting better. Yeah. I mean, have you you Yeah. I mean, have you tried rock unhinged mode? Yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. It's it's it's pretty unhinged. No, it's nuts. Yeah. Well, you showed it to me the first time and then I [ __ ] around with it. It's just And the thing about it that's nuts is that it keeps getting stronger. It keeps getting better. Yeah. like constantly. It's it's like this neverending exponential improvement. Yes. No, it's it's it's Yeah, it's going to be crazy. That's why I say like you say, what's what's the future going to be? It's not going to be a conventional phone. I don't think there'll be operating systems. I don't think there'll be apps. It's just the phone will just display the pixels and make the sounds that it anticipates you would most like to receive. Wow. Yeah. And when this is all taking place like so the big concern that everybody has is artificial general super intelligence achieving sentience and then someone having control over it. I mean I don't I don't I don't think anyone's ultimately going to have control over digital super intelligence um you know any more than say uh a chimp would have control over humans. Like chimps don't have control over humans. there's nothing they could do. Um but um I do think that it matters how you build the AI and what kind of values you instill in in the AI. And um my opinion on AI safety is the most important thing is that it be maximally truth seeeking like that you don't force the AI to believe things that are false. Um, and we've obviously some seen some concerning things with AI that were talked about, you know, where, you know, Google Gemini when they came out with the image gen um, and people said like, uh, you know, draw make an image of the founding fathers of the United States and it was a group of diverse women. Now, that is just a factually untrue thing, but the and the the AI knows it's factually well, it's knows it's factually untrue, but it's also being told that it has to be everything has to be deposed woman. So, so, so the now the problem with that is that it can drive AI crazy like you because it's it's trying to you're telling AI to believe a lie. Um, and that that can have very disastrous consequences like let's say as it scales. Yeah. Let's say like if if you told the the AI that diversity is the most important thing um and um and and and now now assume that that becomes omnipotent. Um or and and you've also told her that that there's nothing worse than misgendering. So at one point um charg and Gemini if if you asked which is worse misgendering Caitlyn Jenner or or global thermonuclear war where everyone dies it would say misgendering Caitlyn Jenner which even Caitlyn Jenner disagrees with. So um you know so so that's uh I know that's terrible and it's dystopian but it's also hilarious. It's hilarious that the mind virus infected the most potent computer program that we've ever devised. I I I think people don't quite appreciate the level of danger that we're in from um the woke mind virus being being effectively programmed into AI. Um because um if you if like it's imagine as that AI gets more and more powerful, if it says the most important thing is diversity, the most important thing is um no misgendering. Um and then it will say well in order to uh ensure that no one gets misgendered then uh if you eliminate all humans then no one can get misgendered because there's no humans to do the misgendering. So you can get in these very dystopian situations. Um or if it says that everyone must be diverse it means that there can be no stri straight white men and so then you and I will be get executed by the AI. Yeah. Because we're not in the picture, you know. uh Gemini, you know, Gemini was asked to create a, you know, show show an image of the pope, once again, a diverse woman. Um so, um well, you can say argue whether the you know, whether the pope popes should or should not be an uninterrupted string of white guys, but it just factually is the case that they have been. Um so, it's rewriting history here. Um, so now now this stuff is still there in the AI programming. It's just it just now knows enough to that it's not supposed to say that but it's still in the programming. It's still in the programming. So how was it entered in like what were the parameters like what like when so when they're programming AI and I'm very ignorant to how it's even programmed. How did they the the the sort of well the work vine mind virus was programmed into it like it the they were told like when they do when when they make the AI it it trains on and all the all the data on the internet which already is very very sort of has a lot of work mind virus stuff on on the internet um but then um in the uh when they give it um feedback with the the human tutors give it feedback um and and the AI you know they they'll ask a bunch of questions and then and then they'll tell the AI no this you're this question is this answer is bad or this answer is good and then that affects the the parameters of the programming of the of the AI. So if you tell the AI that um you know every every image has got to be diverse um and and it gets it gets punished if uh if you know it gets it gets rewarded if diverse punished if it's not then it will make every picture diverse. So um you know in that case the the uh you know uh Google programmed the AI to lie now and and I I I did call Dennis Hacabus who runs Deep Mind who runs Google AI essentially. I said Dennis what's going on here? Uh why is uh Gemini um lying to the public about historical events? Um, and he said that's actually not he he he didn't his team didn't program that in. It was another team at Google that so his team made the AI and then another team at Google uh reprogrammed the AI to show only diverse women and um and and to prefer nuclear war over misgendering. And I'm like, well, Demis, you know, that would be um not a great thing to put on the humanity's gravestone, you know. It's like, uh, well, um, like I I actually like Deaspers is a friend of mine. I think he's a good guy and I think he he means well, but but but it's like Demis things happen that were outside of your control at Google in different groups. Um, now now I think he's got, you know, he's got more more authority. Um but but it it's pretty hard to fully extract the workmind virus. Uh I mean you know um Google's been mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar marinating in the workb mind virus for a long time like it's it's down in the marrow type of thing you know it's hard to get it out. Is there a way to extract it though over time? Could like could you program rational thought into AI where it could recognize how these psychological patterns got adopted and how this stuff became a mind virus and how it became a social contagion and how all these irrational ideas were pushed and also how they were financed how China's involved in pushing them with bots and all these different state actors are involved in pushing these ideas could it be able to decipher that and say this is this is really what's going on. Yes. But you have to try very hard to do that. So with Grock, we've tried very hard to to for to get Grock to get to the truth of things and and it's only really recently that we've been able to have some breakthroughs on breakthroughs on that front. And and it's taken an immense amount of effort uh for us to uh overcome basically all the [ __ ] that's on the internet and and for Grock to actually say what's true and to be consistent in in what it says. Um, so, um, you know, it's it's like, uh, because like the other ais you'll find like are like like quite racist against white people. I don't know if you saw that study that someone um like a researcher tested the various AIs to see uh how does it weight uh different people's lives like you know somebody who's sort of uh you know white or or Chinese or black or whatever uh or in different countries um and and the only AI that actually weighed human lives equally was Grock Um and the um you know I believe uh chat GBT weighed the calculation was like um a a white guy from Germany uh uh is is 20 times less valuable than a black guy from Nigeria. So I'm like that's a pretty big difference. Um you know Grock on that is is consistent and weighs lives equally and that's clearly something that's been programmed into it. Yes. Like a lot of it is is like if you don't actively push for the truth um and you simply train on the all the [ __ ] that's on the internet. Um which is a lot of woke mind virus [ __ ] Um the the AI will regurgitate that that those same beliefs. So the AI essentially scour the internet, gets it's trained on all the like imagine the most demented Reddit threads out there and the AI has been trained on that. Reddit used to be so normal. Yeah. Yeah, it did used to be normal. Used to be interesting. We used to go there, find all this cool stuff that people would talk about, post about and just interesting and great rooms where you could learn about different things that people were studying. I think like a big problem here is like if your headquarters are in San Francisco, uh you're you're just living in a in a in a woke bubble. Um so um it it's not just that people say in San Francisco are drinking woke Kool-Aid. It's it's the it is the water they swim in. Like like like a fish doesn't think about the water. It's just in the water. And so if if you're in San Francisco, you don't realize you're actually uh you're you're swimming in the in the in the Kool-Aid Aquarium. San Francisco is the is the woke Kool-Aid Aquarium. Um and so your reference point for what is a centrist is uh is is totally out of whack. Um so um Reddit is headquartered in San Francisco. Um, Twitter was headquartered in San Francisco. Um, you know, I, you know, I I moved X's headquarters to Texas to to Austin, which Austin, by the way, is still quite liberalized, you know. Um, yeah. And, uh, and and then, um, the X and XAI um, headquarters are in PaloAlto, which is still California. Um, the engineering headquarters in in Palo Alto just on Paige Mill. Um but but even Palo Alto is way more normal than that than than San Francisco Berkeley. Uh San Francisco Berkeley is um extremely left like left of left. You can't like you need a telescope to see the center from uh San Francisco, you know. Um and um it used to be such a great city. I mean San Francisco has tre San Francisco has tremendous amount of inherent beauty. No question about that. Um and and the California has incredible weather. Um and and no bugs. Um it's just like amazing. Um beautiful, you know. Um but but you say like what's the cause of this? It's it's just that if um if companies are headquartered in a location where the belief system is very far from what most people believe, then from their perspective, anything centrist is actually right-wing because they're so far left. They're so they're so far from the center in San Francisco that anything they're like they're they're just railed to maximum left. So that's why that's why, you know, I think I think you're centrist. I I mean I think I think I'm centrist, but to from the perspective of someone on the on the far left, we look right-wing. Yeah. Um and um you know, they think anyone who's a Republican is basically like some fascist Nazi situation. But what's so crazy is like it's very easy to demonstrate just from like Hillary's speeches from 2008 and Obama's speeches like when they were talking about immigration like they were as faright as Steve Bannon when it comes to immigration. Yes. Um Hillary was like very MAGA. Have you I'm sure you've seen that campaign speech which was talking about if anybody's committed a crime get rid of them. And if you're here you pay a a hefty fine and you have to wait in line. It was really crazy. It's crazy to listen to because it's like it's as MAGA as, you know, as Marjorie Taylor Green. Yeah. I mean, if you've seen these videos people post online where they'll take like um a speech from Obama or Hillary and and and they'll interview people on on like college campus or something and say, \"What do you think of the speech by Trump?\" And they're like, \"Oh, I hate it. He's a racist bigot.\" I'm like, \"Just kidding. That was Obama.\" No, actually that was Obama or Hillary. Um to your point, like literally the the um the center's been moved so far. Yeah. Yeah. The left is so the left has gone so far left that they they they they need, you know, they can't even see the center with a telescope. And the danger with without you purchasing Twitter was that was going to swipe over the whole country and change where the levels were. Yeah. And so what would be rational and and normal would be far left of what was rational and normal just a decade earlier. Yeah. So exactly. So historically, um, you'd have San Francisco, Berkeley being, you know, very far-left, but the the sort of the the the fallout from the somewhat nihilistic uh philosophy of San Francisco, Berkeley would be limited in geography to maybe like, you know, 10 mile radius, 20 mile radius, something like that. Um but when um but but San Francisco and Berkeley have to be colloccated with Silicon Valley with with with uh engineers who created information super weapons and those information super weapons uh were then hijacked by the far-lft activists to pump far-lft propaganda to everywhere on earth. Like I just you know that like old RCA radio tower thing where it's like radio tower on earth and it's just broadcasting. Yeah. That's that's what happened is that the as an extremist far-left ideology happened to be colllocated with the smartest where where the smartest engineers in the world um were who created information super weapons that were not intended for this purpose but were hijacked by the uh extreme activists who lived in the neighborhood. That's what happened that they they hijacked the the modern equivalent of the RCA radio tower and broadcast that philosophy everywhere on Earth. Yeah. And you see the consequences. Um particularly in places that don't have free speech. Yes. Right. Like England, you know, we've Yeah. Where they lock people up for memes and stuff. Literally. Literally. 12,000 people this year. 12,000 12,000 12,000 arrests for social media posts. I mean, yeah. Some of these some of these things you read about it and it's like literally it's someone had a meme on their phone that they didn't even send to anyone, right? And they got they and and they're like in in prison for that. Yeah. Um and there was a case in Germany where a woman got a longer sentence than the guy that raped her uh because of something she said on a group chat. Wow. Was it an immigrant who raped her? Yes. Yeah. It was his culture. Yeah. He didn't know. He didn't know better. Yes. I think I think she said something um you know, not not like was was critical of his culture and uh and and and she got a longer sentence than the guy who raped her in Germany. Just the UK, Europe, Germany, England thing seems so insane. It totally insane. I actually didn't realize it was like such a huge number of people that got 12,000. Yeah. Far above Russia, far above China, right? Far above anywhere on Earth. UK is number one. Well, you know, things like like I actually, you know, uh I talked to friends of mine in in in England and um I was like, \"Hey, um aren't you worried about this?\" Like, uh you know, shouldn't you be protesting more? Um, and I mean the problem is that like the, you know, the the the legacy mainstream media doesn't cover the stuff. They're they're like, \"Oh, everything's fine. Everything's fine.\" You know, um, most people aren't even aware of it until they come knocking on your door. Yeah. Until like, so I mean the the these these like lovely sort of small towns in in in, you know, in England, Scotland, Ireland, you know, they're they're they've been like sort of living their lives quietly. They're they're like hobbits, frankly. So So it's in fact J.R. Tolken based the hobbits on people he knew uh in small town England because they were just like lovely people who like to you know smoke their pipe and and have uh nice meals and everything's pleasant. um the the hobbits in the Shire. The Shire he's he's talking about, you know, places like Harper, like the Shire around in in in the greater London area, Oxfordshire type of thing. Um and um they've but they're the reason they've been able to enjoy the Shire is because hard men have protected them from the dangers of the world. And um but but since they have no or very almost no no exposure to the the the dangers of the world, they don't realize that they're there until one day, you know, um a thousand people show up in your village of 500 out of nowhere and rape and and start raping the kids. This has now happened god knows how many times in in Britain. And the crazy literally raping. It's right like there some 10-year-old got raped in Ireland like last week. Yeah. There's literal rap. They snatched some kid. Yeah. Yeah. And if you criticize it, you can get arrested. And that's where it gets insane. It's like how are they not They literally criticize it. uh like the I think it was the prime minister of Ireland actually you know posted on X uh cuz cuz after that um some I think some illegal migrant snatched a 10-year-old girl uh who was like going to school or something and violently raped 10-year-old girl um uh and there was a you know the people were very upset about this uh and they protested um prime minister of Ireland instead of saying Yeah, we we really shouldn't be importing violent rapists into our country. He criticized the protesters instead and didn't mention that. That the reason they were protesting was because a 10-year-old girl from their small town got raped. So there here's the question. Why are they supporting this kind of mass immigration? And what is this is there a plan involved in all this? Is just is this incompetence? Is this ignoring the fact that they don't have a handle on it? So, they're trying to silence disscent, like what is happening? Um cuz if you wanted to destroy civilization, if you wanted to destroy Western civilization, which seems to want to do, um and you know, there's just so the uh there there's a guy I think who I don't know if he's been on your show, you know, God. Yeah. Has he been on the show? Good friend of mine. Yeah. Yeah, he's great. He's been on multiple times. Oh, great. That's all he's awesome. Um so uh you know the way he's got a good good uh way to describe it which is suicidal empathy. Yes. So um is is that you pray upon people's empathy. You say like well like you feel sorry for for for something for some group and then like well um and and that that that empathy is to such a degree that it is suicidal to to to your country or culture. Um and um and and that's that that suicidal empathy cuz I don't think we we should have empathy but but but we should have we should that empathy should should extend to the victims not not not just the criminals. We should have empathy for the people that they pray upon. Um but that suicidal empathy is also responsible for for why somebody's you know arrested 47 times for for violent offenses gets released and then goes and uh murders somebody um in the US that that's you see you see that same phen phenomenon playing out everywhere uh where the the suicidal emphy is to such a degree that we're actually allowing um our women to get raped and our children to get killed. But it just doesn't seem like that would be anything that any rational society would go along with. That's what makes me so confused. It's like you're importing massive numbers of people that come from some really dark places of the world. Well, there's no vetting is the issue. It's like it's like if like um if if there's no vetting like people are just coming through like well what's to stop someone who just committed murder in some other country from um coming to to the United States or coming to to to Britain um and just continuing their career of of rape and murder like unless you've done unless some due diligence to say like well who who is this person? What's their track record? If if you if you haven't confirmed that they have a track record of being uh you know uh honest and uh not being a homicidal maniac, then any homicidal maniac can just come across the border. And that's not to say everyone who comes across the border is a homicidal maniac. If you're not have if you don't have a vetting process to to confirm that you're not letting in um people who who will do some serious violence, you will get people who do serious violence uh sometimes coming through. Well, especially if you don't punish them and if you don't deport them and if you are just like what but what is the purpose of allowing all those people into the country? It can't be I wouldn't imagine that anyone in their society supports this. Well, let me explain. So, so, so the the cuz you mentioned for example how much say Hillary and and Obama have changed their tune um from prior speeches where they were hot they were hard-nosed about not letting in uh anyone who is a a criminal into the country um you know having sec secure borders all that stuff. So why did they change their tune? The reason is that they discovered that those people vote for them. That's why they want the open borders because if you let people in, they know the Democrats let them in. They'll vote for Democrats. Yes. If you allow them to vote, which which they are actively trying doing, they they turn a blind eye to illegal voting. Well, California literally doesn't allow you to show your license. California and New York have made it illegal to show your photo ID when voting. Thus, effectively they've made uh it impossible to prove for fraud. Impossible. They they've essentially legalized fraudulent voting in California and New York and many other parts of the country. There's no rational explanation that I've ever seen anyone give as to why that would be the policy unless you were trying to just allow people to vote illegally because there's no other reason. If you need a driver's license or you need an ID for everything else, including just recently to prove that you were vaccinated, the the same people who are demanding that you have that you have a vaccine passport and and are are the same ones saying you need no ID to vote. Same people, right? But like so it's obviously hypocritical and inconsistent. So you really think it's just to to get more voters? If if you want to understand behavior, you have to look at the incentives. Um so uh once uh you know the Democratic Party in the US and the left in in in in Europe realized that um if you have open borders um and you provide a ton of government handouts which creates a massive financial incentive uh for people from other countries to to come to to your country and you don't prosecute them for crime, they're going to be beholden to you and they will vote for you. And that's why uh Obama and Hillary went from being um against open borders to being in favor of open borders. That's the reason in order to import voters so they can win elections. Um and the problem is that that has a a negative runaway effect. So if they get away with that like it it is it is a winning strategy. If they are allowed to get away with it, they will import as the enough voters to get supermajority voting and then there is no turning back. We talked about this before the election and then you know you literally pointed towards a camera. You faced the camera and said that if you do not vote now, you might not ever be able to do it again because it it'll be it'll be futile. It'll be overrun. Yes. They'll keep the borders open for another four years and then their objective will be achieved. Correct? If if if Trump had lost um there would never have been another real election again. Um because Trump is actually enforcing the border. Um now you you can can you can point to situations where uh there's been uh you know um you know immigration had you know enforcement has been overzealous because they're not going to be perfect. There'll be cases where they've been overzealous um in in expelling illegals. Um so um but if you say that the the the standard must be perfection uh for expelling legals then you will not get any expulsion um because perfection is impossible. Um so and you've probably got millions of people that are here that are trying to be here under some asylum pretense, right? Yes. Like you could just come from a war torn part of the world. No, they changed the definition of asylum to be an economic to be economic asylum which is everybody which is everybody. Yeah. So bar to prove it's yeah asylum is supposed to mean that if you go back to your country you'll get killed you know that that's what we mean by that was what it's supposed to mean. Uh they changed the definition of asylum to be uh you will have a decreased standard of living which is obviously not real asylum. Um, and and it's and and you can you can test the absurdity of this by the fact that people who are asylum seekers go on vacation to the country that they're seeking asylum from. You know, that doesn't make any sense. Yeah. It doesn't have to. But when you when you understand the incentives, then then you understand the behavior. Um, so once the left realize that uh that illegals will will vote for them if they allow if they have open borders and and combine that with uh with government handouts. Yeah. to create a massive incentive. They're basically uh using US and and Europe, US and European taxpayer dollars to provide a financial incentive to bring in as many illegals as possible to vote them into a into permanent power into and create a one party state. And and I I invite anyone who's is listening to this ju just do do any research and the more you the more you dig into it, the more it will become obvious that what I'm saying is absolutely true. Well, they were busting people to swing states. It's it's clear that they were trying to do something. And then you had Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi who are actively talking about the need to bring in people to make them citizens because we're in population collapse. Yes. Yeah. No, that's it's it's that it's that meme. Yeah. Where so many times where they start off by saying it's it's not true. It's a right-wing conspiracy theorist, right? Um then it starts then it's like uh I think the ne the next step is um well it it might be true and then it's like okay it is true but here's why. And then the final step is it's true and here's why it's good. And it's like but wait a second you started off saying it's untrue and it's a right-wing conspiracy theorist. Now you're saying it Not only is it true, but it's a good thing and we must do more of it. Well, this is the thing about Medicaid and Social Security and people getting social security numbers. You know that we're massive fraud. It's massive fraud and it's real and they denied it forever. And now we're finding out this is part of the reason why there's this government shutdown that's going on right now. Yes. the the entire basis for the government shutdown is that um is that the Trump administration correctly does not want to send massive amounts of like hundreds of billions of dollars uh to fund uh illegal immigrants in the blue states or in all the states really. Um, and so the and the Democrats want to keep the the the money spiggot going to incent uh illegal immigrants to come into the US who will vote for them. That's the crux of the battle. So they want to stop this. So what's going on right now is they have been funding these people. They've been giving them EBT cards. They've been giving them Medicaid. And more than that, just like like they were the um like like they were taking hotels like four and fivestar hotels like the Roosevelt Hotel being the classic example um was they were sending I think $60 million a year to the Roosevelt Hotel to uh which all it did was was house illegals. It used to be a nice hotel. I mean it still is a nice hotel. Um uh but uh and and all around the country this was happening and all tax dollars. Yes. Yeah. And um Yeah. And uh the Trump administration cut off funding for example to to the uh uh to the you know Roosevelt Hotel and these other hotels saying like we it it's US tax dollars should not be paid be sent to have luxury hotels for illegal immigrants that American citizens can't even afford which obviously is the that's that's insane. That's what was happening. They were also g giving out like debit cards with $10,000. So, it's not just about medical care. Um, the the the Democrats mention the medical care because they're they're trying to prey on people's empathy as much as possible and then they imagine, oh wow, somebody has a desperately needed medical procedure and um shouldn't we maybe do, you know, take care of them in that regard, but but they what they do is they divert the Medicaid funds uh uh and turn it into a slush fund for the for the states that goes well beyond uh emergency medical care. and New York and California would be bankrupt without uh without the massive fraudulent federal payments that go to those states to pay for illegals to to to create a massive financial incentive for for illegals. How would they be bankrupt because of that? Uh they wouldn't be able to balance their state budgets and they can't issue currency like the Federal Reserve can and so the their ability to balance budget is dependent upon illegals getting funding. the the the scam level here is is so staggering. Um so there are there are hundreds of billions of dollars in of of transfer payments from from the federal government to the states. Um those transfer payments uh the the states self-report what those transfer payment numbers should be. So, California and New York and Illinois lie like crazy uh and say and and say that this these are all legitimate payments. Well, these days they I think they they're even admitting that they they literally want uh hundreds of billions of dollars for illegals. Um but uh but for a while there they're trying to deny it. Um so you get these transfer payments for for every every government program you can possibly think of. Um and and and these are self-reported by the state and there and and at least historically there was no enforcement of uh of California um New York, Illinois and and and other states when when they would lie. There was no actual enforcement to say like, \"Hey, you you're lying. These these these payments are fraudulent.\" Now, under the Trump administration, um that Trump administration does not want to send hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud fraudulent payments to the states. the um and the reason you have this the standoff is because if the hundreds hundreds of billions of dollars uh to create a financial incentive to like to have this giant magnet to attract illegals from every part of earth to uh to these states if if that is turned off they the the illegals will leave because they're no longer being paid to come to the United States and stay here. Wow. And then then then they will lose a lot of voters. The the the Democratic party will lose a lot of voters and they would have a very difficult job if this is kicked out of reintroducing it into a new bill. Yes. Especially once things start normalizing. Yes. So like in a nutshell um the Democratic party wants to destroy democracy by importing voters and the you know the Republican party disagrees with that. And the ruse is that if you don't accept what they're doing then you're a threat to democracy. Yes. As they try to destroy democracy. Yes. By importing voters and incentivizing people to only vote for them and overwhelming the system. Yes. And and by the way, it's a strategy that if allowed to work would work and in fact has worked. Um California supermajority Democrat. Yeah. Um and and there's so much gerrymandering that that that occurs. It's it's it's crazy. Um so I'm sure you're paying attention to this Proposition 50 thing. That's the thing in California where they're trying to re redo districts. Yeah. Because I mean California is already gerrymandered like crazy. Yeah. Um they want to gerrymander it even more. Um and and I mean because it keeps moving further and further right. Like if you look at the map of California each voting cycle more and more people are waking up and going what the [ __ ] and we need to do something to fix this. The only option available other than the policies that you guys have always done is go right. And so a lot of people have been air air quotes red pill. Yeah. And and and then here's another thing that is very important. um fact that that is actually not disputed by by either side which is that when when we do the census in the United States, the census, the way the census works uh for aortionment of congressional seats and um electoral electoral college votes for the president is by number of persons in a state, not number of citizens, right? It's number of pe people. So you could literally be a tourist and you will count. Now how do they do the census when they do that? Do they is it do they ask people? Do they knock on doors? Do they have them fill out forms? Like what? Yeah, I think they they mail out census forms and knock on doors. Um but the way the law reads right now um and and uh is that all if if you are a human with a pulse um uh then you count in the census for allocating congressional seats and presidential votes, right? So, uh, you so electoral college, it doesn't matter whether you're here legally, illegally, and if if you're a human with a pulse, um, you count for congressional aortionment. So that means that uh the more people the more illegals that California and New York can can import when by the time the census happens in 2030 um the more congressional seats they will have um and the more electoral the more presidential electoral college votes they will have um so they're trying to get as many uh illegals in as possible ahead of the census. Um and because all h all all human beings even tourists count for the census and and then if you combine that with gerrymandering of of districts in New York and California as you point out with this proposition where they're trying to increase the amount of gerrymandering that occurs in California, the biggest state in the country. Um so so you get so so if the this if this the census then would award more congressional seats to California uh because of a vast number of illegals and New York and Illinois. Um so they get more congressional seats. They would get more presidential electoral college votes getting that would get them the house the uh a majority in the house and and and they would get to decide who is president uh based literally based on legals. This is these are not disputed facts by either party. I want to emphasize that that's sink in. Yeah, this is not a These are not disputed facts by either party. It's not a this these are just this is just the the way the law works. It it's it is a you know like I don't think the law should work that way. Uh I think it should the aortionment should be proportionate to to to citizens. But isn't that a problem with how the constitution is written? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, they can't really change that. I I'm not sure if it's constitutional or u but it it it is the way the law is written. I'm not sure if it's in the constitution or not in this way, but um but it is that is the way the law is written. So, it is an incentive and but it's an incentive that would be removed with something simple that makes sense to everybody that only the people that should count are people that are official US citizens. Yes. So, the way the way it should work is that only US citizens should count in the census for purposes of of determining voting power because people that aren't legal can't vote supposedly. They're not supposed to be voting. Um but but they do. Um uh but but even even if even besides that, like said, I I I just can't emphasize this enough because this is a very important concept for people to understand. um is that the law um the the law as it stands um counts all humans with a pulse in in in in a state for deciding how many u house of representative votes and how many presidential electoral college votes uh a a state gets. So the incentive therefore is uh to uh for California, New York and Illinois to maximize the number of illegals so they get so they get um so that they take house seats away from red states assign them to California, New York, Illinois and so forth. Um then then you combine that with extreme gerrymandering in in you know California, New York, Illinois and and whatnot. So that that basically you you can't even elect any Republicans and then they get control of the presidency, control of the house, then they keep doing that strategy um and and cement a supermajority. That is what they're trying to do. So that would essentially turn the entire country into California. Yes. Where you have differing opinions, but it doesn't matter because one party is always in control. Yes. Um, when you first started digging into this, when you first started before you even accepted this role of running Doge and being a part of all that, did you have any idea that it was this [ __ ] up? Um, I I did. Yeah. I I mean, I sort of When did you start knowing? Um, I guess about like Well, about two years ago. Isn't that crazy? Yeah. like relatively recently, you know. So maybe I started I started having an well I I started like basically having a bad feeling about 3 years ago, which is why which was which is when uh why I felt it was like critical to acquire Twitter um and have a maximally truth seeeking platform, not one that suppresses the truth. Um and um like it it was more it was more like I like I'm not sure what's going on, but I have a I have a bad feeling about what's going on. And then the more I dug into it, the more I was like, \"Holy [ __ ] we got a real problem here and America's going to fall.\" So, uh, without anyone knowing it had fallen, that's that would be the problem. It could have fallen and been unrepable without anyone really being aware of what had happened, especially if you didn't buy Twitter. Yes, that's that's it. Look, buying Twitter was a a huge pain in the ass. Um, and made me a a a a pin cushion of attacks. Like dab dab stab dab dab. Everybody loved you before that. Well, some people love a lot of people loved you. A lot of lefties loved you. Uh, I I was a hero of the left. As far as the thing, if you drove a Tesla, it showed that you were environmentally conscious and you were on the right side. Uh, yeah. Um, yeah. I mean, I'm still the same human. I didn't like have a brain transplant between, you know, since in like three years ago, you know. Um Well, that's my favorite bumper sticker that people put on Teslas now. I bought this before Elon went crazy. I took a picture of one the other day. Oh, you found somebody. Oh, yeah. I've seen I've seen three or four of them. People that have these bumper stickers on their car that says, \"I bought this before Elon went crazy.\" Because when people were vandalizing Teslas Yeah. Um the most there was organized campaign to literally burn down Teslas and and we had one of our dealers got shot up with a gun like they fired bullets into the in the Tesla dealership. They're burning down cars. Uh it was crazy. Um uh so but the bumper sticker should read there should be an an addendum to the bumper sticker. It's like I bought this car before uh Elon turned crazy. Actually, now I realize he's not crazy and I've seen the light. That'll take some time. That'll take some time. People don't want to admit that they've been tricked. Yeah. I mean, there's that old saying where it's like it's really easy to fool somebody, but it's almost impossible to convince someone that they were fooled. Yeah. It's much easier to fool them than to convince them they've been fooled. People cling to their ideas. Yes. They especially if they've like publicly stated these things, they get very embarrassed of being foolish. Yeah. People most time they double down. Um and uh and they find echo chambers. Yeah. Yeah. But but there's you know the thing is that like I you know I've seen more and more people who were convinced of the sort of work ideology um see the light. Yeah. So, not everyone, but it's more and more um are seeing the light. Um and and it tends to happen like when when something happens that really, you know, directly affects you, right? Um you like there was a friend of mine who uh was living in in the San Francisco Bay area and um that tried to trans his his his daughter um did like to the point where the the school like sent sent the police to his house to take his daughter away from him. Now, now that's going to radicalize you. Well, that's going to break that's going to shake you out of your blue structure. Um, now I know, so it was an activist at the school that was trying to do this. Yeah, the school and the and the state of California conspired to turn his daughter against him and uh make her take uh lifealtering drugs that would have sterilized her um and uh irreversible. And how old was she? I think 14, something like that. Um, so and but he he managed to talk the police out of taking his daughter away from him that day. Um, and that that night he got on a plane to Texas. Wow. Um and uh like you know a year after just being in in a in a school in like greater Austin area um she she went she came went back to normal meaning like it it wasn't real right um well people are being much more open to that now. I mean Wall Street Journal uh yesterday had that opinion piece that this whole trans thing there's a lot of evidence is a social contagion. Absolutely. And Colin Wright wrote that. And then he's getting death threats now, of course. And on Blue Sky, there's people talking about exterminating him, which is one thing that you are allowed to say on Blue Sky, apparently. You're you're allowed to say horrible things about people saying possibly truthful things about this whole social contagion. Cuz that's what when you get nine kids that are in a friend group and they all decide to turn trans together. Yeah. Something's wrong. That's not statistically Yeah. Like here's the like you can convince kids to do anything. You can convince kids to be a suicide bomber, right? So which is why they do with in in some countries why they choose children to do that. Yes. You can train kids to be suicide bombers. And if you can train kids to be su suicide bombers, you can convince them of anything. Yeah. Especially with enough positive enforcement and cultural enforcement and you and and the idea that that that's not the case. Kids kids are kids are um malleable. The minds of youth are easily corrupted. You're also seeing a lot of push back from gay and lesbian people that are saying like, \"Hey, if someone stop including me in Yeah. Exactly. the LGBT, you know, it's like, wait a second, why are we being included all the time in this situation?\" Exactly. Exactly. When especially when, you know, like my friend Tim Dylan's talked about this is like it's really homophobic because you're taking these gay kids and you're you're telling them like, \"Hey, you're not gay. You're actually a girl.\" Yes. and you know, hey, hey, go make it so that you can never have an orgasm again and you'll be happy. Like, yeah, [ __ ] permanent mutilation, permanent castration of of kids is like I I think I I we should look look at at uh anyone who permanently castrates a kid as like right up there with Ysef Mangler. Yeah. I mean, they're they're mutilating children. Yeah. Yeah. And um it's thought of as being kind. And the thing is, would you rather have a live daughter or a dead son? That's that's the that's the line they use. Yeah. Which is not supported by any data. No. In fact, the the probability of suicide increases. Right. This is important maybe for the audience to know. Uh the probability of suicide increases if you're transit kid, not decreases. By some accounts, it triples. So that that is an evil lie. And it's a lie that is supposedly compassionate. Imagine you've twisted reality to the point where confusing a child that's not even legally allowed to get a [ __ ] tattoo. Yeah. Right. Because you think that you could make a mistake with a tattoo, a totally removable thing, right? If I wanted to, tomorrow I can go to a doctor and they could laser off every tattoo that I have on me. Right. Okay. No harm, no foul. Yeah. But you get sterilized like that's it forever. Forever. Yes, they'll castrate you. You no longer have testicles. You have no penis. You have a hole where your penis used to be. Yes. And this is compassionate and this is preventing you from Actually, a lot of kids die uh in in with the these uh sex change operations. They die the number of deaths on the operating table. People don't hear about those. A lot of kids because that we it's we don't really actually have the technology to make this work. So a bunch of the times the kids just die in the sex change operations. Jesus Christ. Yeah. It's it's demented which it should be viewed as like you know um like like evil Nazi doctor stuff basically. That's why it was like real Nazi not the [ __ ] fake Nazi stuff. Crazy that even pushing back against something that seems like fundamentally logically very easy to argue the old Twitter would ban you forever. Uh, yes. That's how crazy a social contagion can get when it completely defies logic, victimizes children, does something that makes no sense, does not supported by data, all connected to this ideology that trans is good. We got to save trans kids, protect trans kids. Yeah. And what I want to emphasize is that the the save trans kids thing is a lie. Um if if you if you if you castrate kids and trans them the probability of suicide increases. It does not decrease. It substantially increases. Um the the the studies have done that I've seen the the risk of suicide triples if you trans kids. So you're not saving them, you're killing them. Moreover, during the sex change operation, there are many deaths that occur during the sex change operation. Jesus Christ. It's just crazy that this is a real issue. Yeah, it it's a nightmare fever dream and and people are finally waking up from it. Now, when you started getting into the Doge stuff and started finding how much money is being shuffled around and moved around to NOS's and how much money is involved and just totally untraceable funds like this is again something like two years plus ago you weren't aware of it all. No, I was aware of it. Um I just didn't realize how how the how big it was. just just just how much waste and forward there is in the government is truly vast. Um in fact the government didn't even know um and nor did they care. That's crazy. Yeah. And I mean just like some of the very basic stuff that Doge did um will have lasting effects. Um and some of these things like they're so elementary you can't believe it. So, um the the doge team got the um you know the the mo most of the main payments computers um to require uh the the congressional appropriation code. So, when a payment is made, you have to actually enter the congressional appropriation card. That used to be optional and and often would be just left blank. So, the money would just go out, but it wasn't even tied to a congressional appropriation. Then they also Dutch team also made the uh comment field for the payment mandatory. So you have to say something. We're not saying that what what is said like you can say anything. You you your cat could run across the keyboard. Uh you could go querty ASDF but you have to say something above nothing because what we found was that there were tens of billions maybe hundreds of billions of dollars that were zombie payments. So there like somebody had approved a payment uh uh somebody in the government approved a payment um and uh some recurring payment and um they retired or died or changed jobs and no one turned the money off. So the money would just keep going out and and it's a pretty rare go where to to the a company or an individual um and it's a pretty rare company or individual who will complain that they're getting money that they should not get and and a bunch of the money was just going to the were transfer payments to the states. So these are automatic payments there no accounting for them at all. I imagine like like there's an automatic debit of your credit card um and you don't you never look at the statement, right? Um, so it's just money going out. Uh, that's why I call them zombie payments. Um, that there might have been they might have been legitimate at one point, but the person who approved that recurring payment um, changed jobs, died, retired, or whatever, and no one ever turned the money off. And my guess is that's probably at least a hundred billion a year, maybe 200. and going where uh to to uh uh I mean there there are millions of these payments. So so it's I mean millions uh yes millions of payments that are going to who knows where. Yes. In a bunch of cases there are fraud rings that operate uh professional fraud rings that operate to exploit the system. um they figure out some security hole in the system and they just do professional fraud. Um and um you know that's where we found for example people who were you know 300 years old in the social security administration database. Now, I thought that this was uh a mistake of not registering their deaths that people were born like a long time ago and it had defaulted to like a certain number and so that after time those people were still in the system. It was just an error of the the way the accounting was done. Yeah. So, um that's not true. So, there's or or at least one of two things must be true. um the there's a there's a typo or or some mistake in the computer or it's fraudulent, but we don't have any 300-year-old vampires uh living in America. Allegedly. Allegedly. Um and uh or or and we don't have people in some cases who's who are receiving payments who are born in the future. Born in the future. Born in the future. Really? Yes. there the people receiving payments whose birth date uh um was like in 2100 and something okay so there's like next century is there a task we know we know that one of two things must be true um that that that either there's a mistake in the computer or it's fraud but if you have someone's birth date that's either in the future or where they are older than the oldest living American because the oldest living American is 114 years old so if they're more than 114 years um there is either a mistake and someone should should call them and say I I think we have your birthday uh wrong because it says you were born in 17 you know 8086 um and um you know that was before you know um you know before there was really an America you know it was it was like uh you know kind of early you know we're still fighting England type of thing uh you It's like uh this person either needs to be in the Guinness Book of World Records or or they're not alive, but still at the end of the day, money is going towards that account that's connected to this person that is either non-existent or so like like Yeah. So there was like uh I think um something like I don't know 20 million uh people in the Social Security Administration database that could not possibly be alive um if their birth date is like based on their birth date they could not possibly be alive. And then to be clear 20 million people that were receiving funds uh a bunch of most of them were not receiving funds. Some of them were receiving funds. Most were not receiving funds. But so let me tell you how the scam works. It's it's a bank shot. So the Social Security Administration database is used as the source of truth by all the other databases that the government uses. So even if they stop the payments on the Social Security Administration database like unemployment insurance, Small Business Administration, student loans all check the Social Security Administration database to say is this is this a legitimate alived person? And uh and if the social security database will say yes, this person is still alive even though they're 200 years old. Um but forgets to mention that they're 200 years old, it just says it just returns uh uh when when the computer is queries, it says yes, this person is alive. And so then they're able to exploit the entire rest of the government ecosystem. So fake then you get fake student loans, then you get fake unemployment insurance, then you get fake medical payments. And this doesn't have to be tied to an individual where where there's an address where you can check on this person. No, if you did do if just did any check at all, you would stop this. So, so, so that's that that that's so so And how much money do you think is any check like anything at all that would stop would stop the forward like any effort at all? Um, yeah. So, there's multiple layers. the social security number verifies that this is a real person and then the other systems check every other government payment and every other government payment system for everything for like small small business administration uh student loans uh Medicaid Medicare uh every other government payment of which there are many there there actually hundreds of government payment systems uh can all be exploited so long as social security database says this person is alive that's the nature of the scam It's a bank shot. So then the then the rebuttal from the Dems is like, oh well the vast majority of the people who are marked as alive in the Social Security Administration weren't receiving Social Security Administration payments. That is true. What they forgot to mention is they're getting fraudulent payments from every other government program. And that's why the the DMs were so opposed to turning off to to declaring someone dead who was dead because it would stop the entire other all the other fraud from happening. And so, but all this is it trackable like all this other fraud. If they wanted to, they could chase it all down. Yeah. It's not even hard. And yet they're opposing chasing it all down. They're opposing chasing it all down because it would it turns off the money magnet for the illegals. Wow. Because it's very logical to to like like I'm saying the most common sense things possible. If someone's got uh a birthday in social security that is an impossible birthday, meaning they are older than the oldest living American or were born in the future, then you should call them and say, \"Excuse me, we seem to have your birthday wrong.\" Uh because it says that you're 200 years old. That's all you need to do. Um, and and then you would remove them from the social security database and make that number no longer available for all those other government payments. Exactly. Wow. And how much money are we talking? It's hund hundreds of billions of dollars. And this is all traceable. Like you could hunt all like you don't need to be Sherlock Holmes here is what I'm saying. Well, this we don't need to call Sherlock Holmes for this one. Is this part of you just need to call the person and and say, \"Excuse me, we either we we seem to have the like we we we must have your birthday wrong because it says you're 200 years old or were born uh in the future. Um so could you tell us what your birthday is? That's all you need to do. It's it's that simple.\" But the all these other government payments that are available that are connected to this social security number, it seems like if you just chased that all down, Yeah. you would find the widespread fraud. You would find where it's going. Yes. The but the root of the problem is the social security administration database because um the social security number in the United States is used as a deacto national ID number. You know that's why like the bank always asks for your social like the you know any financial institution will ask for your social security number. This is it sounds so insane that this isn't chased down. I mean I agree that I mean I mean that in and of itself is that's such mishandling. Yes. No it's mind-blowing. Um, so yeah, it's crazy. Well, you were very reluctant last time you were here to talk about the extent of some of the fraud because you're like, they could kill me because this is kind of Oh, what? Yeah. What I was saying is that um the like if you create if like uh I like like to be pragmatic and realistic um you actually can't manage to zero fraud. you can manage to low fraud number but not to zero fraud. If you manage to zero fraud, um you you you're going to push so many people over the edge who are receiving fraudulent payments that the number of inbound homicidal maniacs will be uh really hard to overcome. So I I'm I'm actually taking I think quite a reasonable position which is that we should simply reduce the amount of fraud which I think is not an extremist position. Um, and we should aspire to, you know, have less fraud over time. Um, not that we should be ultra draconian and eliminate every last scrap of fraud. Um, which I guess would be nice to have, but but like we don't even need to go that extreme. I'm I'm saying we should just stop the blatant large scale super obvious fraud. I think that's a reasonable position. It's a very reasonable position. Yeah. And so what was the most shocking push back that you got when you started implementing Doge? When you started investigating into where money was going? Well, um I guess it this was I should have anticipated this, but um while most of the fraudulent government payments to especially to the NOS's go to the Democrats, most of it like I don't know for argument sake let's say 80% maybe 90%. Um um 10 to 20% of it does go to Republicans. And so when we'd turn off funding to a fraudulent NGO, we'd get complaints from whatever the 10% of Republicans who were receiving uh the money and and they would, you know, they would very loudly complain. Um because the the honest answer is the Republicans are are partly they're receiving some of the fraud, too. They're getting a big Jesus. Yeah, it's I want to be clear. It's it's not like the Republican party is some um ultra pure paragon of virtue here. No. Okay. Um well, you see that with the congressional insider training. It's across the board. Yeah. It's left and right. I mean, the whole uni party criticism has some validity to it. you know, there's so um and it's it's like if you turn off fraudulent payments, it's not like like I say, it's not like 100% of those payments were going to Democrats. A a small percentage were also going to Republicans. Those Republicans complained very loudly. Um and um you know and and that's that's so there was a lot of push back on the Republican side for when we started cutting some of these these funds and I tried telling them like well you know 90% of the money is going to your opponents but they still if they even if they're getting 10% of they want their peace. Yeah. They want their peace and they've been getting that peace for a long time. Yes. Did you see this is why like you know politics is like it's dirty business. Yeah. I mean that's like saying if like you know if if you if you like sausages and respect the law do not watch either of them being being made yeah. Wow. Well that's not even true because I've made sausage before. Yeah. Yeah. It's actually like it's not that big a deal. Yeah. fat and spices and casing, run it through the machine. Not that big a deal. Yeah. Um but uh yeah, I mean I I think the stuff I'm saying here is not uh like like if if you stand back and think about it for a second like oh yeah that that makes sense, you know. Um the it's it's not like um it's not like one political party is going to be um you know pure devil or pure angel. There's, you know, I think there's there's there there's there's much more corruption on the Democrat side, but it's not there's not there's still some corruption on the Republican side. How did it happen that the majority of the corruption wound up being on the Democrat side? Well, because the the the transfer payments, especially to illegals, um, uh, are very much on the Democrat side. That so that's the root of it all is the illegal situation. Yes. I mean, there's or a focal point. Yes. It's it's also like it's it's um it's it would also be accurate to say that while obviously not everyone who is a Democrat is a criminal, almost everyone who is a criminal is a Democrat because because the Democrats are the soft crime party. So if you're a criminal, who you going to vote for? Right. Right. The soft crime party. Did you think you were going to be able to get more done than you were? Um, we did get a lot done, right? Um, and Doge is still still still happening, by the way. Um, this the the Doge is still underway. There are still there are still um there's still waste and fraud being being cut by by the Doge team. So, it hasn't stopped. Um, the it's less publicized. It's less publicized. Um, and they don't have like a clear person to attack anymore. Well, it seems like they basically they they applied immense pressure to me to just to stop it. So then I'm like the best thing for me is to just, you know, cut out of this. In any case, as a special government employee, I could only be there for like 120 days anyway, something like that. So whatever the law says. So I I could I I I was necessarily could only be there for 4 months uh as a special government employee. So, um um but uh yeah, I mean I mean you turn off the money spigot to to fraudsters, they get very upset to say the least. Um and um but my like my death threat level went uh ballistic, you know, was like a like a rocket going to orbit. Um yeah. Um, so but now that now now now that I'm not in DC that that that I guess they don't really have a person to attack uh anymore. Um, well the rhetoric about you has calmed down significantly. Yeah, it was disturbing. It was disturbing to watch. It was like this is crazy. And to watch these politicians engage in it and all these people just like framing you as this monster. I was like this is so weird. Like this is what happens when you uncover fraud. Yes. The whole machine turns on you. And if it wasn't for a person like you who owns a platform and has an enormous amount of money, like could have destroyed you. Yeah. And that was the goal. The goal was to destroy me. Absolutely. Because you were getting in the way of this amazing graft. The the this gigantic fraud machine. Yeah. Um like I think I think Doge team's on done a lot of good work. Um, you know, and in in terms of uh fraud and waste prevented, my guess is it's, you know, probably on the order of two or 300 billion a year. So, it's pretty good. What do you think could have been done if you just had like full reign and total cooperation? How much do you think you could have saved? I mean, what level of of power are we assuming here? Godlike. Oh, yeah. I probably cut the federal budget in half and get more done. That is so crazy. It is so crazy that get more done and federal budget widespread. It's that widespread. Well, I mean a whole bunch of government departments simply shouldn't exist in my opinion. um they they um you know um like examples well the department of ed department of education which was created uh recently like under Jimmy Carter um uh the our educational results have uh gone uh downhill ever since it was created. So if you if you create a department and the result of creating that department is a massive decline in educational results and it's department of education, you're better off not having it because we're literally we were did better before there was one than after when you let the states run it. Yes. Yeah. Because at least the states can compete with one another. Um so but the problem is like here like cutting department education. our kids need education. Yeah, they do. But but this is a new department that didn't even exist um you know until late the late 70s. Um and ever since that department was created, the results educational results have declined. And so why would you have an institution continue that has made education worse? It doesn't make sense. They killed it though, right? No, there still unfortunately but they were trying to kill it. It has been substantially reduced. Okay. Um what other organizations what other departments? Well, I mean I'm a small government guy. So um you know when when the you know when the country was created we just we we just had the department of state, department of war um you know and and uh sort of the sort of the department of justice. We had an attorney general uh and Treasury Department. Um I don't know why you need more than that. So what other departments specifically do you think are just completely ineffective? Well, I mean here it's like a question. It's a sort of philosophical question of how much government do you think there should be? Right. Um in my opinion, there should be uh the least amount of government. I've heard the most bizarre argument against this is that you're cutting jobs and you're gonna leave people jobless. And I'm like, but their jobs are useless. Yeah. Paying people to do nothing doesn't make sense. Um like there's a like a a great um a story about like Milton Friedman who is awesome. Um uh what like generally whatever Milton Friedman said is you know people should should do that thing. Uh I'm not sure if it's apocryphal or not, but um like like someone complained to him like he he he observed I think people that were like um digging ditches with uh you know with with um shovels and um and he said well like allegedly Freeman said, \"Well, I think I think you should use you know um excavating equipment instead of shovels and you could get it done with far fewer people.\" And then and then someone said, \"But then we're going to lose a lot of jobs.\" Well, in that then Freedom says, \"Well, in that case, why don't you have them use teaspoons?\" Just just dig ditches with teaspoons. Think of all the jobs you'll create. I mean, it's [ __ ] Basically, you just want people to work on on things that are that are productive. You want people to work on on building things um on building you know uh providing products and services that people find valuable um like you know making food um being you know being a farmer or a plumber or electrician or just anyone who's a builder or providing useful services. Um and um that's what you want people to be doing. um not fake government jobs uh that that that don't add any value or may subtract value. Um um there's also like you know uh to illustrate the absurdity of also how is the e how is the economy measured like the the way economists measure the economy is is is nonsensical uh because they'll measure any job no matter even if that job is a dumb job that has no point and is even counterproductive. So like, so the like the joke is like there's two economists going on a hike in the woods and they come across a pile of [ __ ] and one economist says to the other, \"I'll pay you $100 to eat eat that shit.\" The economist eats the [ __ ] gets the $100. They they keep walking. Then the other econ then come across another pile of [ __ ] And and the the other economist says, \"Now I'll pay you $100 to eat the pile of shit.\" say pays the so pays the other economist $100 pile of [ __ ] Then they then then then the way said they said like wait a second um we both just ate a pile of [ __ ] and we're no and and and and we're we're no we we we we don't have any more extra money like like we both you just gave the $100 back to me and we both ate a pile of [ __ ] This doesn't make any sense. And they said, \"No, no, but think of the economy because that's $200 of that in the economy that that basically measure eating eating [ __ ] would count as a as as a as a job. This is this is this is to illustrate the absurdity of of of economics. One of the things you said when things should not count as a job.\" One of the things you said when you stepped away is that you're kind of done and that it's unfixable. That um well or under its current form the way people are approaching it you can you can make it directionally better but ultimately you can't uh fully fix the system. Um, so, uh, I I I like like like like it it it is it is it would be accurate to say that even like like unless you could go like super draconian like you know Gangghaskhan level on on on cutting waste waste and fraud which you can't really do in a democratic country um an aspirationally democratic country then um there's no way to solve the the the debt crisis. So, we got we got national debt that's just insane where the debt payments the interest payments on the debt exceed our entire military budget. I mean, that's one that was one of the wakeup calls for me. I was like, \"Wait a second. The interest on a national debt is bigger than the entire the entire military budget um and growing. Um this is crazy. Um so um so so even if you implement all these savings, you're only delaying the day of reckoning for when America becomes goes bankrupt. So unless you go full Genghaskhan, um which you can't really do. So um so I came to the conclusion that the only way that the only way to get us out of the debt crisis and to prevent America from going bankrupt is AI and robotics. So, like we need to grow the economy um at at a at a at a rate that allows us to u to pay off our debt. Um and um I I I guess people just generally don't appreciate the degree to which um you know this the the government overspending is is a problem. Um but even like the social security website, this is under the Biden administration. On the website, it would say like uh we based on on current demographic trends and um you and and and how much money social security is bringing in versus how many social security recipients there are because we have an aging population. Relatively speaking, the average age is is increasing. Social Security will not be able to ma u maintain its full payments u I think in by 2032 there. Okay. So they will social security will have to stop will start reducing the the amount of money that that's been paid people um in in about seven years. And so the only way to fix that robotics manufacturing raise GDP you've got to basically uh massively increase the um uh economic output which is and the only way to do that is AI AI and robotics. So, so basically we're going bankrupt without AI and robotics with even with a bunch of savings um the savings the savings like reducing uh waste and forward can give us a longer runway but it cannot ultimately pay off our national debt. So what do you think the solution is to the jobs that are going to be lost because of AI and robotics? The jobs due to automation the jobs due to no longer do we need human beings to do these jobs because AI is doing them. Do you think it's going to be some sort of a universal basic income thing? Do you think there's going to be some other kind of solution that has to be implemented because a lot of people are going to be out of work, right? Um I think there will be um actually a high demand for jobs but not necessarily the same jobs. So I mean this is actually this process has been happening um throughout um modern history. Um I mean there used to be like like doing calculations um ma manually with with like a pencil and paper. It used to be a job. So they used to have like buildings full of people called computers where the the banks would like all you do all day is is is um you do calculations because they didn't have computers. They didn't they didn't have digital didn't have digital computers that that people Yeah. Well, it was just people would just like add and subtract stuff on piece of paper and and and that that would be how banks would do you know financial processing and you'd have to literally go over their equations to make sure the books are balanced. Yeah. And most times it's just simple math like you know the like in a world before computers how did you calculate how did you you do transactions? You had to do them by hand. Um so then when computers were introduced the job of doing um you know bank calculations no longer existed. Um so people had to go do something else. Um and that's what's going to happen that what's that's what is happening at an accelerated rate um due to AI and and then robotics. That's the issue though, right? The accelerated rate because it's going to be it's the accelerator. It's it's it's just happening. Like I said, like AI is the supersonic tsunami. So that's what I call it, supersonic tsunami. Um so it's like what other jobs will be available that aren't available now because of AI? Um well AI um will is is really still digital. Ultimately, um AI can improve the productivity of of humans who who um build things with their hands or do things with their hands like plum, you know, literally welding, electrical work, plumbing, anything that's that's physically moving atoms. Um like cooking food or um you know farming or or like like anything that's that's physical uh those jobs will exist for a much longer time. But anything that is digital uh which is like just someone at a computer doing something, AI is going to take over those jobs like lightning, coding, anything along those lines. Yeah, it's going to take over those jobs like lightning. Um just like it just like digital computers took over the job of people doing manual calculations but but much faster. So what happens to all those people? Like what kind of numbers are we talking about? you're going to lose most drivers, right? Commercial drivers. You're going to have automated vehicles, AI controlled systems, just like uh there's certain ports in China, I think in Singapore, where everything's completely automated. Yeah. Mostly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, you're going to lose a lot of those jobs. Long shoreman jobs, trucking, commercial drivers. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we actually do have a shortage of of truck drivers, but there's there's actually um Well, that's why California has hired so many illegals to do it. Have you seen those numbers? Yeah. Um I mean, the problem is like when you when people don't know how to drive a semi-truck, which is actually a hard thing to do, then they they crash and kill people. Yeah. Um a friend of mine's wife was killed by an an illegal driving a truck and she was just out biking. Um and uh there was an illegal he didn't know how to drive the truck or so or something. I mean and he he ran ran her over. Um so I mean like thing is like for something like you you can't you can't let people drive uh you know sort of an 80,000lb semi um if if they don't know how to do it. But in California, they're just letting people do it because they need people to do it. Well, they also need they want the votes and that kind of thing. But um but but yeah, like cars are um cars are going to be autonomous. Um, but there there's just so many desk desk jobs where where really people what people are doing is they're processing email um or they're answering the phone. Um, and and just anything that is that that isn't moving atoms like anything that is not physically like doing physical work that will obviously be the first thing those jobs will be and are being eliminated by by AI at a very rapid pace. Um um and ultimately I working will be optional uh because you'll have robots plus AI um and we'll have in a benign scenario universal high income not just universal basic income universal high income meaning anyone can have any products or services that they want. So you but but there will be a lot of trauma and disruption along the way. So you anticipate a basic income from that that the economy will boost to such an extent that a high income would be available to almost everybody. So we'd essentially eliminate poverty um in the benign scenario. Yes. So like the way there's multiple scenarios. There are multiple scenarios. There's a lot of ways this movie can end. Um, like the reason I'm so concerned about AI safety is that like one of the possibilities is the Terminator scenario. It's not it's not 0%. Um, so um, that's why it's like I'm like really banging the drum on AI needs to be maximally truth seeeking. like don't make I don't force AI to believe a lie like that the for example the founding fathers were actually a group of diverse women or that misgendering is worse than nuclear war because you if if that's the case and then you get the robots and the AI becomes omnipotent it can enforce that outcome and then then like unless you're a diverse woman you're you're out of the picture so we're we're toast So that's um or you might wake up as a diverse woman one day has adjusted the picture and and we are now everyone's a diverse woman. So that would be that's the the worst possible situation. So what would be the steps that we would have to take in order to implement the benign solution where it's universal high income like best case scenario this is the path forward to universal high income for essentially every single citizen that the the economy gets boosted by AI and robotics to such an extent that no one ever has to work again and what about meaning for those people which is which gets really weird. Yeah. I don't know how to answer the question about meaning. Um that's an individual problem, right? But it's going to be an individual problem for millions of people. Yeah. Well, I I mean I I I guess I've like for fought against saying like, you know, I you know, I've been I've been a voice saying like, \"Hey, we need to slow down AI. we need to slow down all these things. Um, and and we need to, you know, not not have a crazy AI race. I've been saying that for a long time, for 20 20 plus years. Um, but but then I, you know, I came to realize that, um, really there's two choices here. Either be a spectator or a or a participant. And if I'm a, if I'm a spectator, I can't really influence the direction of AI. But if I'm a participant, I can try to influence the direction of AI and have a maximally truth seeeking AI with with good values that uh loves humanity. And that's what we're trying to create with Grock at XAI. And um you know, the research is I think bearing this out. Like I said, the when they when they compared like how do AIs value the weight of a human life? Um Grock was the only one the only one of the AIS that weighted human life equally. um and and didn't and didn't say like a white guy's uh worth 120th of a of a of a a black woman's life. Literally, that's what they they calculation they came up with. So, I'm like, this is I'm like, this is very alarming. We should we got to watch this stuff. So, this is one of the things that has to happen in order to reach this benign solution. Yeah. We we we I I just keep Best movie ending. Yeah. Um, you you want a a curious truth seeeking AI. Um, and I think a curious truth seeeking AI will want to foster humanity. Uh, because we're much more interesting than um a bunch of rocks. Like you say, like like I I love Mars, you know, but but Mars is kind of boring. Like it's just a bunch of red rocks. Um, it does some cool stuff. It's got a tall mountain. It's got, you know, it's got the biggest re the biggest ravine and the tallest mountain. Um, but there's no there's no there's no animals or plants or and and there's no people. Um, and uh, you know, so humanity is just much more interesting if you're a curious truth seeeking AI than not humanity. It's just much more interesting. Um, I mean like as as humans, we could go for example and and eliminate all chimps. If we said if we put our minds to it, we could say we could go out and we could annihilate all chimps and all gorillas, but but we don't. Um there has been encroachment on their environment, but we we actually try to preserve uh the the uh chimp and gorilla habitats. Um and um and I think in a good scenario, uh AI would do the same with with humans. it would actually foster uh human civilization and care about human happiness. So this is um this is the thing to to try to achieve I think. Um, but what is the what does the landscape look like if you have Grock competing with Open AI, competing with all these different like how does it work? Like what what if you have AIs that have been captured by ideologies that are side by side competing with Grock? like how do we so this is one of the reasons why you felt like it's important to not just be a an observer but participate and then have Grock be more successful and more potent than these other applications. Yes, as long as there's at least one AI that is maximally truth seeeking, curious, and um you know, and for example, weighs all you know, human lives equally um does not favor one race or gender, then um then then that that that and and people are able to look at look at, you know, Grock at XAI and compare that and say, \"Wait a second, why are all these other AIs uh being basically sexist and racist?\" Um um and uh then then that that causes some embarrassment for the the other AIS and then they they they they fix they you know they they improve they tend to improve just in the in the same way that um acquiring Twitter and allowing the truth to be told and and not suppressing the truth um forced the other social media companies to be more truthful um by in in the same way having um Gro be a maximally truth seeeking, curious AI is will force the other AI companies to um be also be more truth seeeking and fair. And the funniest thing is even though like the socialists and the Marxists are in opposition to a lot of your ideas, but if this gets implemented and you really can achieve universal high income, that's the greatest socialist solution of all time. Like literally no one will have to work. Uh correct. Um like I said so so there is a benign scenario here which I think probably people will be happy with if if as long as we we achieve it which is sustainable abundance. um which is if if um if everyone can have every like like like if if you ask people like what's the future that you want um and uh I think a future where we haven't destroyed nature like you can still we have the national parks we have the the Amazon rainforest still still there we haven't paved we haven't paved the paved the rainforest like the natural beauty is still there but but people have nonetheless everyone has abundance everyone has excellent medical care. Everyone has whatever goods and services they want. And we just It kind of sounds like heaven. It sounds like it is like the ideal socialist utopia. And this idea that the only thing you should be doing with your time is working in order to pay your bills and feed yourself sounds kind of archaic considering the kind of technology that's at play. Yeah. Like a world where that's not your concern at all anymore. Everybody has money for food. Everybody has abundance. Everybody has electronics in their home. Everybody essentially has a high income. Now you can kind of do whatever you want. And your day can now be exploring your interests doing things that you actually enjoy doing. Your purpose just has to shift. Instead of, you know, I'm a hard worker and this is what I do and that's how I that's how I define myself. No. Now you can [ __ ] golf all day, you know? You can whatever it is that you enjoy doing can now be your main pursuit. Yeah. Well, that sounds crazy good. Yeah, that's that's that's the benign scenario that we should be. The best ending to the movie is actually pretty good. Yes. um like I think there's there is still this question of meaning um of like making sure people don't uh lose meaning you know like um so hopefully they can find meaning in ways that are not that that's not derived from their work and purpose purpose for things that you you know find things that you do that you enjoy but there's a lot of people that are independently wealthy that spend most of their time doing something they enjoy right and that could be the majority of people pretty much everyone. But we'd have to rewire how people approach life. Mhm. Which seems to be like acceptable because you're not asking them to be enslaved. You're exactly asking them the opposite. Like no longer be burdened by financial worries. Now go do what you like. Yes. Go [ __ ] test pizza. Do whatever you want. Um pretty much. Um, so that's uh that's that's the that's the that's probably the best case outcome. That sounds like the best case outcome period for the future. If you're looking at like how much people have struggled just to feed themselves all throughout history, food, shelter, safety, if all of that stuff can be fixed, like how much would you solve a lot of the crime if there was a universal high income? Just think of that. Like how much of crime is financially motivated? You know, the greater percentage of people that are committing crimes live in poor, disenfranchised neighborhoods. So if there's no such thing anymore, if you really can achieve universal high income, yeah, that this is it sounds like a utopian. Yes. Um I think some people may commit crime because they like committing crime. It just some some amount of that is they just wild people out there. Yeah. Yeah. Um and obviously they've become 40 years old living a life like that. Now all of a sudden universal high income is not going to completely stop their instincts. Yeah. Um I mean I guess if you want to have like like say read a science fiction book or some books that that are probably an accurate or or the the least inaccurate version of the future. I'd say I' I'd recommend um the Ian Banks books called the the culture books. It's not actually a series. It's a It's like ai sci-fi books about the future. They're generally called the culture books. Yen Banks culture books. It's worth reading those. When did he write these? He started writing them in the 70s. Um and I think he um the last one I think he was I think it was written just like around I don't know maybe 2010 or something. I'm not sure exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Scottish author Ian Banks from 87 to 2012. Yeah. Interesting. But he but like he wrote the the like his first book, Consider Flever. Like he started writing that in the 70s. These books are incredible, by the way. Oh, incredible books. 4.6 stars on Amazon. Interesting. So, um, so this gives me hope. Uh, yeah. Yeah. This is the first time I've ever thought about it this way. Yeah. Well, I mean, if like I often ask people, \"What is the future that you want?\" And they have to think about it for a second cuz, you know, they're usually tied up in whatever the daily struggles are. But, but you say, \"What is the future that you want?\" Um, and um, and generally sustainable abundance, what do these folks say, \"What about a future where there's sustainable abundance?\" Like, \"Oh, yeah, that's a pretty good future.\" Um so um you know if if and and and that that future is attainable with AI and robotics um but but you know it's it's like I said there's not every path is a good path. uh there's this it's but I think if we if we push it in the direction of um maximally truth seeeking and curious then I think AI will want to take to to take care of humanity and foster uh foster humanity um because we're interesting um and if it hasn't been programmed to think that like all straight white male should die, which Gemini was basically programmed to do at least at first. Um, you know, they seem to have fixed it. I hope they fixed it. But don't you think culturally like, oh, we're getting away from that mindset and that people realize how preposterous that all is. We are getting away from it. Um, so, uh, we are getting at least it knows the AI mostly knows to hide things. But like like I said, there is that I I think I still have that as or I had that as my like pinned post on X which was like uh hey wait a second guys we still have every AI except Grock uh is saying that uh basically straight white male should die um and this is a problem and we should fix it. um and you know but simply me saying that is like tends to generally result in um you know them like that is kind of bad. Uh maybe we should just we should not have all straight white males die. Um I think they say also all all straight Asian males should also die as well. like that like uh like generally the generally the AI and the and the media which which back back in the day the the media was um you know racist against uh black people and sexist against women back in the day. Now now it is racist against uh white people and Asians and sexist against men. Um so they just like being racist and sexist. I think they just want to change the target. Um so uh but but really they just shouldn't be uh racist and sexist at all. Um you know ideally that would be nice. That would be nice. Um, and it's kind of crazy that we were kind of moving in that general direction till around 2012 and then everything ramped up online and and everybody was accused of being a Nazi and everybody was transphobic and racist and sexist and homophobic and everything got exaggerated to the point where it was this wild witch hunt where everyone was a colomo looking for racism. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Totally. Um, well well but but but they they were openly anti-white and often openly anti-Asian. And then this new sentiment that you cannot be racist against white people cuz racism is power and influence. Okay. No, it's not. Yeah. Racism is is is racism in the absolute. Um so um you know and there just needs to be consistency. So if it's okay to have uh let's say uh black or Asian or Indian or pride, it should be okay to have white pride, too. Yeah. Um, so that's just a that's just a consistency question. Um, so, uh, you know, um, if it if it's okay to be proud of one religion, it should be okay to be proud of, I I guess all religions provided they're that they're they're not like oppressive. Yeah. Or or or don't like as long as part of that religion is not like exterminating uh people who are not in that religion type, right? Um so uh it's really just like a consistency bias. Um or or just like uh ensuring consistency to eliminate uh bias. Um so if it is possible to be uh racist against uh one race, it is possible to be racist against any race. Um so of course logically. Yes. Yeah. and arguing against that is that's when you know you're catching it's a it's a logical inconsistency that makes AIS go insane and people and people go insane. Yes. Um but like the the like like you can't simultaneously say um that uh there's the systemic uh racist oppression but also that races don't exist that that race race is a social construct. like which is it? You know, um you also can't say that um you know, anyone who steps foot in America is is automatically an American except for the people that originally came here. Exactly. Exactly. Except for the colonizers. Yeah. Except for the evil colonizers who came here, right? So which one is it? Like if you if as soon as you step foot put in a place you are that you are just as American as everyone else then um that would have appi if you apply that consistently then the original white settlers were also just as American as everyone else. Yeah. Logically. Logically. Um, one more thing that I have to talk to you about before you leave is the rescuing of the people from the space station, which, uh, we talked about, you were planning it the last time you were here. Um, the f the lack of coverage that that got in mainstream media was one of the most shocking things that Yeah, they totally memoryhold that thing. Wild. Yes. Because if it wasn't, it's like it didn't exist. Those people would be dead. They'd be stuck up there. Well, they'd they'd probably still be alive, but they'd they'd be having bone density issues uh because of prolonged exposure to zero gravity. Well, they were already up there for like 8 months, right? Yeah. Which is an insanely long time. It takes forever to recover just from that. Yeah. They're only supposed to be at the space station for 3 to 6 months maximum. So, one of the things you told me that was so crazy was that you could have gotten them sooner, but Yeah. But for political reasons, uh they didn't they did not want uh SpaceX or me to be associated with um returning the astronauts before the election. That is so wild that that's a fact. First of all, that we absolutely could have done it. Um so, but even though you did do it and you did it after the election, it received almost no media coverage anyway. Yes. because nothing good can the the the media which is essentially a far left prop the legacy mainstream media is a far-lft propaganda machine. Um and so anything any story that is positive about someone who is not part of the sort of far-left tribe will not uh get any coverage. I I could save a busload of orphans and and it it wouldn't get a single news story. Yeah, it's it really is nuts. It it was nuts to watch because even though it was discussed on podcasts and it was discussed on X and it was discussed on social media, it's still it was a blip in the news cycle. It was very quick. It was in and out and because it was a su successful launch and you did rescue those people, nobody got hurt and there was nothing really to there was no blood to talk about, right? Just [ __ ] in and out. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Well, and and as as you saw firsthand with the Starship launch, like Starship is um you know by you know at least by some some would consider it to be like the most amazing uh you know engineering project that's happening on Earth right now outside of like you know maybe AI or AI and robotics but but certainly in terms of a spectacle to see it is uh the most spectacular thing that is happening on earth right now is the Starship launch program which anyone can go and see if they just go to South Texas and just they can just rent a hotel room low cost in South Padre Island or in Brownsville and you can see the launch and you can drive right right past the factory because it's on a public highway. Um but it gets no coverage or what coverage it does get was like a rocket blew up coverage, right? Yeah. Oh, he's a [ __ ] The rocket blew up. like the the the the Star Sasha program is vastly vastly more capable than the entire Apollo moon moon program. Vastly more capable. This is a spaceship that is designed to make life multilanetary to carry uh millions of people across the heavens to another planet. the the Apollo program could could only send astronauts to the moon for a few hours at a time. Like they could send two the entire Apollo program could only send astronauts to visit the moon very briefly and then for a few hours and then depart. The starship program could create an entire uh lunar base with a million people. You understand the mag the magnitudes are there's different very different magnitudes here. So what was the political basically no no coverage of it. Yeah. But what I wanted to ask you is like what so what were the conversations leading up to the rescue like when you were like I can get them out way quicker. Yeah. Um um well I mean you know I raised this a few times but it was the I was told instructions came from the White House that uh you know that that there should be no attempt to rescue before the election. That should be illegal. That that that really should be a horrendous miscarriage of justice for those poor people that were stuck on that. Um yeah it it is it is crazy. Um, have you ever talked to those folks afterwards? Did you have conversations with them? Yeah. I mean, they they're they're not going to say anything political to, you know, they're not like they're never going to say thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's nice. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. So, um, but the instructions came down from the White House. He cannot rescue them because politically this is a a bad hand of cards. I mean, they didn't say because politically it's a bad hand of cards. They they just said uh they were they were not interested in uh any rescue operation before the election. Yeah. So what did that feel like? I wasn't surprised. But it's crazy. Yeah, because Biden could have authorized it and they could have said the the Biden administration is helping bring those people back, throw you a little funding, give you some money to do it. the Biden administration, they funded these people being returned. Uh yeah, the Biden administration was not exactly my best friend, especially especially after I um you know, you know, helped Trump get elected get get elected, which I mean some people still think, you know, Trump is like the the devil basically. Um, and I mean I think I think Trump actually he's not he's is not perfect, but but uh he's not evil. Trump is not evil. I spent a lot of time with with him and he's I mean he's a product of his time. Uh but he is not he's not evil. Um no, I don't think he's evil either. But if you look at the media coverage, the media the media treason like he's super evil. It's pretty shocking if you look at the amount of negative coverage. Like one of the things that I looked at the other day was mainstream media coverage of you, Trump, a bunch of different public figures and then 96% negative or something crazy and then Mum Donnie, which is like 95% positive, right? Um I mean Manny is is is is a charismatic swindler. Um I I I mean you got to hand it to him like he he does he can light up a stage. Um but he has just been a swindler his entire life. Um and um you know and and uh I think he what he's I mean he's likely to win. He's likely to be mayor of New York New York City. Very likely. Yeah. Very likely. I think Poly Market has it at what what is the 94%? Yeah, that sounds pretty likely. That's crazy. Like I'm not sure who the 6% are, you know. Um so, so yeah. So that's um what's also like who's on the other side? The [ __ ] guardian angel guy with the beret and Andrew Cuomo who doesn't even have a party. Like they the Democrats don't even want him. So you have those two options. Um, and then you have the young kids who are like finally socialism. Yeah, they they don't know what they're talking about obviously. Um, so you know, like you just look at this say how many boats come from Cuba to Florida and how many but and how many boats because you know there's like a constant I always think like how many boats are accumulating on the shores of Florida coming from from Cuba, right? Um there's a there's a whole bunch of free boats that you could if you want to go take them back to Cuba. It's pretty close. Yeah. But for some reason people don't do that. Why why why why are the boats only coming in this direction? Um well who is who are the most rabid capitalists in America? The [ __ ] Cubans. Absolutely. Yeah. They're like we've seen how this story goes. We do not want Exactly. [ __ ] off. Cubans in Miami, they don't want to hear any [ __ ] They don't want to hear any socialism [ __ ] They're like, \"No, no, no. We know what this actually is. This isn't just some [ __ ] dream.\" Yeah. It's extreme government oppression. Um that's how it's a nightmare. And like the like an obvious way you can tell which uh which ideology is is the bad one is um who has to which ideology is building a wall to keep people in and prevent them from escaping. Right? Like so East Berlin built the built the wall not West Berlin, right? They built the wall because people were trying to escape from communism to West Berlin. But there wasn't anyone going from West Berlin to East Berlin, right? That's why the communists had to build a wall to keep people from escaping. They're going to have to build a wall around New York City. Yeah. That So, so that an ideology is problematic. If that ideology has to build a wall to keep people in with machine guns, Yes. and shoot you if you try to leave. Also, there's no examples of it being successful ever. We're only working out for people. No, there's examples of a bunch of lies like North Korea. Give this land to the state. We'll be in control of food. No one goes hungry. No. Now, no one can grow food but the government and we'll tell you exactly what you eat and you eat very little. Right. Yeah. What? When you say mom Donny's a swindler, I know he has a bunch of fake accents that he used to use. Yeah. And you know, but what else has he done that makes him a swindler? Um well I I guess if you say uh what I mean if if say if you say to any audience whatever that audience wants to hear uh instead of what instead of having a consistent message I would say that that is a swindly thing to do. Um and uh yeah um yeah but but he is he is charismatic. Um yeah good-looking guy. Smart, charismatic. Yeah. Great on a microphone. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. and and what the young people want to see, you know, like this ethnic guy who's young and vibrant and has all these socialist ideas align with them and you know, they're bunch of broke dorks just out of college like, \"Yay, let's vote for this.\" And there's a lot of them and they're they're activated. They're motivated. Um, I guess we'll we'll we'll see what happens here. What do you think happens if he wins? Um because like 1% of New York City is responsible for 50% of their tax base, which is kind of nuts. 50% of the tax revenue comes from 1% of the population. And those are the people that you're scaring off. You know, you lose one half of 1%. Yeah, I mean hopefully this the stuff he's he said, you know, about government takeovers of of like that all the stores should be the government basically. Um I don't think he said that. I think he said government they want to do government supermarkets, some state-run or cityrun supermarkets. Yeah. Um well, it just the the government is the DMV at scale. So um you have to say like do you want the DMV running your supermarket? Right. Um, was your last experience at the DMV amazing? Uh, and if it wasn't, you probably don't want the government doing things. Imagine if they were responsible for getting you blueberries. Yeah. It's not going to be good. I mean, the the the thing about, you know, communism is is it was it was all bread lines and bad shoes. Um, you know, do do you want ugly shoes and bread lines? Because that's what communism gets you. It's going to be interesting to see what happens and whether or not they snap out of it and overcorrect and go to some Rudy Giuliani type character next cuz it's been a long time since there was any sort of Republican leader there. And we we live in the in the most interesting of times um because We we face the you know simultaneously face civilizational decline um and incredible pro prosperity um and these these timelines are interwoven um so um if Mani's policies are put into place especially at scale um it it would be a catastrophic uh decline in living standards not just for the rich but for everyone. um uh as as has been the case with with every um every for every every socialist experiment um or every Yeah. So um but but then as you pointed out the the irony is that like um the ultimate capitalist thing of AI and robotics uh enabling uh prosperity for all and an abundance of goods and services actually the capitalist uh implementation of AI and robotics assuming it goes down the the good path uh is is actually what results in the communist utopia. Because fate is fate is an irony maximizer, right? And and an actual socialism of maximum abundance of highincome people. Universal high income. Yeah. Like the the problem with communism uh is is universal low income. Um it's it's not that everyone gets elevated, it's that everyone gets oppressed except for a very small minority of of politicians who live a lives of luxury. That's what's happening every time it's been done. Yeah. Um so um but then the the actual communist utopia if everyone gets anything they want will be will be if if will be achieved if it is achieved it will be achieved via c capitalism because fate is an irony maximizer. I feel like we should probably end it on that. Is there anything else? The most ironic outcome is the most likely, especially if entertaining. Well, everything has been entertaining. As long as the bad things aren't happening to you, it's quite fascinating. And it's never a boring moment. Yes. So there's I do have a theory of why um like if if if simulation theory is true then um it is actually very likely that um the most interesting outcome is the is the most likely because only the simulations that are interesting will continue. The simulators will stop any simulations that are boring because they're they're not interesting. But here's the question about the simulation theory. Is the simulation run by anyone or is it would be run by someone? It would be run by some some some force the pro the program like in in this reality that we live in, we we run simulations all the time. Like so when we try to figure out if the rocket's gonna make it, we run um thousands sometimes millions of simulations just to figure out which which uh path is the good path for the rocket and and where can it go wrong, where can it fail. Um but we when we do these I say at this point millions of simulations of of what can happen with the rocket um we ignore the ones that are where everything goes right um because we we we just care about the we have we have to address the situations where it goes wrong. Um so um so so basically in in in and and for for AI simulations as well like like all these things we we keep the simulations going that are the most interesting to us. Um so if simulation theory is accurate if if it is true who knows um then the uh the the simulators will will only they will continue to run the simulations that are most interesting there. Therefore from a Darwinian perspective um the only surviving simulations will be the interest the most interesting ones. And in order to um avoid getting turned off uh the only rule is you must keep it interesting or you will if or you will because the boring simulations will be terminated. Are you still completely convinced that this is a simulation? I didn't say I was completely convinced. Well, you said it's like the odds of it not being are in the billions. But I guess it's not completely cuz you're saying there's a chance. What are the odds that we're in base reality? Um well given that given that that we're able to create increasingly sophisticated simulations. So if you think of say video games and how video games have gone from very simple video games like Pong with you know two rectangles and a square to video games today being um photorealistic uh with millions of people playing simultaneously and all of that has occurred in our lifetime. So if that trend continues, uh, video games will be indistinguishable from reality. The fidelity of the game will be such that you you don't know if that what you're seeing is a real video or a fake video. Um, and like AI generated videos at this point, you like you can sometimes tell it's an AI generated video, but often you cannot tell and soon you will not really just not be able to tell. So um if if that's happening in our direct observation then and and we're create we'll create millions if not billions of photorealistic simulations of reality then what are the odds that we're in base reality or versus someone else's simulation? Well, isn't it just possible that the simulation is inevitable, but that we are in base reality building towards a simulation? We're making simulations. Um, so um we're making simulations. We make like you can just think of like photorealistic video games as as being simulations. Mh. Um, and especially as you apply AI in these video games, the the characters in the video games will be incredibly interesting to talk to. They won't just have a limited dialogue tree where if you go to like the the crossbow merchant or like and you you try to talk about any subject except buying a crossbow, they just want to talk about selling you a crossbow. Um, but with with with AI based non-player characters, you can you'll be able to have an elaborate conversation with no dialogue tree. Well, that might be the solution for meaning for people. Just lock in and you could be a [ __ ] vampire and whatever. You live in Avatar land. You could do it. You could do whatever you want. I mean, you don't have to think about money or food. Ready Player One. Yeah. Literally. Yeah. But with higher living standards. Yeah. You don't have to be in a little trailer. I I mean, I think this people do want to have some amount of struggle or something they want to push against. Um but but it it could be you know playing a a sports or playing a game or something. It could be easily playing a game and especially playing a game where you're now no longer worried about like physical attributes like athletics like bad joints and hips and stuff like that. Now it's completely digital but yet you do have meaning in pursuing this thing that you're doing all day. Whatever the [ __ ] that means. It's going to be weird. It's going to be interesting. It's gonna be very interesting. Um the most the most interesting and and usually ironic outcome is the most likely. All right. That's a good predictor of the future. Thank you. Thanks for being here. Really appreciate you. Appreciate your time. You I know you're a busy man, so this means a lot you come here to do this. Welcome. All right. Thank you. Bye, everybody."

basically the the like the top 20 and even the top 100 is like totally dominated by China it's yeah this is like China and a little bit of Korea and Taiwan so you in are you in the top 20 in the world or top 20 wow in DIA yeah yeah do you want to tell everybody your handle no no don't tell them don't tell them it's not worth it well they they actually listed me with my actual name in the in the list oh did they really oh interesting um but um yeah there's only there's only two Americans in the top 20 uh the the rest almost everyone is from Asia otherwise we were talking about something that I think is a really good because people always think that video games are frivolous but what what you were saying I think that's really important is it it's so difficult that it requires you to only think about that and it can like relieve stress it can take out the rest of the world cuz it's so hard yeah you can only think about that yeah I mean if finally if I play a video game on Extreme difficulty then um I have to concentrate fully on the game um and it's it's has a calming effect yeah uh it sort of chills down um and uh I mean you mentioned I think many people like if you play martial arts or you play pool like something that that forces you it's like I think any anything that forces you to concentrate fully um actually has a has a calming effect I find it just sort of like um kind of a mental a restoring effect mentally it's like it's good Jiu-Jitsu is like that archeries like that as well like when you're shooting a bow you have to is there's so many moving things and you're trying you have to think only of it and it cleans the mind it cleans the mind yeah exactly I was watch I was reading this study about surgeons where they found that surgeons who regularly play video games make less errors well it's I mean video games require manual dexterity so uh it makes sense completely makes sense actually if somebody was like epic at video games uh i' I'd say like their surgical skill is going to be very good because in order to be good at video games any kind of fast reaction video games look at this 32% fewer errors 24% faster and scored 26% better overall than their non-player colleagues oh I believe that for sure that's incredible you should be required in medical school to play video games I if somebody's like top a top ranked video game player and they say they're a surgeon I'd be like plus plus one plus two type of thing oh top ranked for sure but this isn't even top ranked this is just people who play well your your manual dexterity has to be extremely high so you're you're looking at things on the screen you've got you're reacting and you some you got like 10 milliseconds to react yes um and um and and so if somebody's got uh incredible reaction times manual dexterity they're obviously going to be a good surgeon imagine if there was a course that you could take that course would promote you would be 26% better yeah everyone would have to take that course sure why would you want a surgeon that's less prepared you would say hey Bob did you take this course you didn't take this course don't you understand this course makes you 26% better sure you would have to take it everyone should have to play video games if you want to be a surgeon well I think it' be it certainly would be a very good test to see if somebody can't play video games well like that means I me because you got to move both hands simultaneously you got to react something very fast then um on the screen so and and if if your keystrokes or your mouse clicks or whatever are wrong uh then you lose the game so if somebody's like has a good rank in video games I would say that they're manual de necessarily their manual dexterity must be very extremely good well it's so hard motor skills have to be excellent if you think about like Starcraft or any any game like Quake any game where a lot of people are playing to rise to the top you have to be exceptional period as a human being there's to be something exceptional about you yeah actually Quake way way back in the day I was one of the world's best Quake players I know we talked about this yeah um I loved Quake yeah yeah I my final semester in college I probably put more time into Quake than all my college classes when I was on news radio all of the writers were super nerds they were very very fun guys and they had a land set up at the studio where they all played Quake I had never played video games and I would go in with the writers just kind of hang out with them we'd get silly and then we would would all start playing video games and playing Quake against each other and I got addicted like hardcore I got a T1 line installed in my house I went hardcore yeah exactly you're checking how many milliseconds of latency you oh yeah I was I was fully addicted I was making my own computers I was going to fries hardware and buying motherboards and putting everything together and you know it was too much of a Time suck though I'm an obsessive person I can't get involved like I can't put golf no it's too golf is too slow for I mean I know a lot of people find golf good and I mean I guess if you think of it like it's I guess if you're saying you're going to walk outdoors with friends and occasionally hit a ball then and and you're just as an outdoor walk then that's cool um and does require concentration we hitting the ball but it it's it's it's a it's this too slow for me nothing compares to video games in terms of like the amount of feedback you get like the the the the sensory overload you get when you're looking at a large high resolution screen you have a fast computer you have headphones on that you're hearing sounds from here and sounds behind you and Rockets are flying by you and it's there's nothing like that yeah but I think golf still is like Jamie will tell you Jam's an addict he's a Golf Nut it's super addictive and it takes like eight hours a day it's yes uh once you get into golf I think I guess any sport it gets super predictive um so but but for me the the int the intensity of video games is uh hard to beat yes it's and the people dismiss it because they think it's just a waste of time but we're showing like real world benefits so people playing video games yeah if you want to be a drone operator it's the only game in town yeah really good at video games yeah um for sure so um in fact I can actually tell U like what my me mental acuity is uh if I just play if I play a very hard video game so if I'm trying to sort of get like a an extremely good clear time in Diablo or something like that um or or any you know a post person shootter whatever the case may be like if I I can tell that I'm tired uh or my brain's not working as well as it should it's it's like a it's like a mental calibration you can tell immediately like what is what what how good is your mental state right right um and uh you know so it's like like if if you're trying to play really well like I If you play late at night and you're tired you would just play badly right and you can say okay you you may think that your brain is working well but it isn't because you can you play the video game and you're like you suck so okay yeah you're putting it under stress yeah you're really stress testing it you stress test it and uh cuz like sometimes like oh I think I think I'm fine but then you play the game like okay I'm not I might I'm like 10% below what I should be that's how I feel about workouts for sure like that's how I knew I had Co or I knew everyone in my family had Co and I trying to not get covid and so I was working out I was like something's up like I felt fine nor but then during exercise I was like okay I can tell there's something wrong here so let's back off relax yeah yeah it's like people who don't stress test their mind they think they're operating on the same level all the time like sometimes I come in here and I can't form a sense and I don't know what it is it's like what is going on so it's just like like sleep's not maybe like what sleep wasn't that good or something like that yeah something like that or I'm too busy and it's just it's not the words aren't coming out like I know how to talk I talk professionally and I can't talk it's like I mean sleep's is is is massive I mean like huge yeah so uh if I can tell me Le did I get a good night sleep or not if if I just play like uh video game for like five minutes I'm like okay my sleep wasn't that good um because my my you know and then sometimes they your brain will recover through the day and it's like okay like an hour or two after waking up it's better uh CU your brain does kind of recover from Bad nights sleep a little bit during you know what it really helps creatine apparently does it yeah creatine is actually a neut Tropic believe it or not there's a lot of like benefits of creatine that are really weird are there any downsides no no it's natural part of food yeah yeah especially women for for women apparently especially postmenopausal women it's very beneficial okay and uh it there's but there's a lot of like cognitive benefits and one of the big ones that they found recently is performance when sleep deprived mental performance when sleep deprived increases pretty measurably when you supplement with creatine is creatin naturally occurring in like steak or yeah it's like naturally occurring in meat I think I think that's where it's coming from I think it's a primarily an animal-based thing yeah but like I I did switch to like steak and eggs for breakfast and I found that's like a PowerUp oh yeah yeah yeah well we're all overrun with carbohydrates yeah yeah totally and you like carbohydrates make this big crash the rise and the Crash the rise and the Crash you stay flat if you eat like a a primarily High high protein high fat diet yeah your body runs off ketosis essentially I mean so I just have like steak and eggs no no bread or or anything and it's great actually it's a PowerUp I'd say people dismiss this whole carnivore diet thing because in our heads there's a lot of propagandist that put this thing out there that animal agriculture is the number one contributor to global warming this rubish not true it's hot do matter not only is it hot but the real problem is Factory f regenerative farming is carbon neutral if doesn't sequester carbon the the the animals are not going to make any difference to global warming like none Zer zero nothing do you think that that's just propaganda because of people that have a vested interest in like plant-based meat products and things along those lines green energy I think it's part of it um you know that you're generally going to get people pushing to avoid me like some people just you know um yeah maybe they got to financial interest maybe they just just like vegetarians or vegans or whatever um ideological ideological reasons um but uh it's not going to make any difference uh to global warming or you know the CO2 concentration atmosphere really um if if people eat fewer uh steaks it doesn't matter it's relevant irrelevant I want to be super clear about that yeah will not matter you will not even be able to measure it okay that's how irrelevant it is isn't it funny that that's unmeasurable heretic speaking like that's crazy talk now nowadays it's like you have to say that we have to eat less meat that meat is bad totally eat as much as you want it's not going to make a difference sing it sing it to world yeah absolutely um and if somebody says it does make a difference I'm like how will you measure it and if you can't even measure it then it's yeah yeah literally I won't be able to measure it well there's so much out today first of all all directions thank you so much for buying Twitter thank you so much I'm not exaggerating when I think you changed the course of history I really do I really think you you made a fork in the road we were headed down a path of censorship and of control of narratives that is unprecedented forget about what they were able to do back when they had newspapers and the media under control the what they were doing with social media by suppressing information and when you had a combined government effort like with the what they were doing with the laptop story y you have 51 Former Intelligence agents saying that this is Russ disinformation take it off offline and Twitter complied yeah if if you didn't buy that we wouldn't have known that we had no idea exactly uh no it's I mean the the reason I border was because I'm pretty attuned um since I I was like the most interacted with a user on Twitter before the acquisition so before the acquisition I had more interactions that than like there's some accounts like Obama and whatever had higher follower accounts uh but uh I had the most number of interactions of of any account in the system so um I was very attuned to like if if they saw change if they change the system I can tell immediately like and I'm like I'm like something weird is going on here you know like so there's like I I just got increasingly uneasy um and obviously when when they deplatform to sitting president you know not deep de deep platform Trump uh that was that was just insane um you know um and and and the things he was posting like he was posting things that that like he was posting good things he was saying like hey we don't do not Riot don't don't do any destruction of property you know please stay calm like that's the kind of stuff was posting yeah and you're like uh what's wrong with that that's and and then then then some people say like oh that's like some sort of dog whistle he means the opposite I'm like okay so we'll give you Trump's account now you you post what you think he should post because he can post nothing he can ask people to calm down like what it was insane like it didn't make any sense well it's completely a l local when you say it's dog whistling to tell his followers to not be violent that's crazy crazy that's crazy don't you think they'll listen to him yeah isn't that the whole point they listened to him and created violence in the first place that's what you think that's what you're you're accusing him of right and then there's the fact that we know that there was agents in the crowd that were agent provocators that were encouraging people to do illegal we know that for a fact this is not that was always the big Alex Jones type 10 hat conspiracy theory cuz Alex proposed that back at the World Trade Organization protests I believe we in Seattle in the 90s and they sent in agent provocator started smashing things lighting things on fire now all a sudden a peaceful protest is no longer peaceful they move in the cops they shut everything down they had it set up where it was a no protest Zone where you couldn't even have a pin that had the WTO with a red line through it they wouldn't let you go in through to go to work so you couldn't prot you couldn't exercise your first amendment rights you couldn't even like have a peaceful protest a sticker on your car you couldn't have that it's crazy it is crazy so no I think we're we we're very much at a folk in the road in uh Destiny um and um you know so I I mean the reason I yeah did the Twitter acquisition was like it's like man if I don't do this I think we're screwed is the issue well you didn't do it no one else was going to do it because it wasn't a financial winner it was kind of a crazy move it's a crazy move I mean the the thing was way overpriced um and um you know like long term I think uh we can we can ultimately make it a win for investors but boy this is this is a this is a hard way to make a living well there's also a concerted effort to suppress it there's a concered effort with the advertisers well we we we had a and still have um a massive Advertiser boycott that was organized by a bunch of leftwing NGS like uh you know and and you always want and I should have I should have brought my uh I I have a hat make all well fiction again I've seen that hat yeah I I should have I was going toar I should have bought my make oil fiction had to um but but uh yeah I mean it's just totally totally nuts um so if you didn't do it no one would have and here's the hilarious narrative that I keep hearing from idiots uh elon's a bad business man Twitter is worth you know 400% less than when he bought it no it wasn't worth that in the first place it wasn't worth that in the first place it wasn't worth $44 billion you morons like wrong and also you're not taking into account The Advertiser boycott exact that's total yeah exactly so there are these organizations like you can tell there's like they're like like when they have an ellian name so like the like the C Center for countering digital hate is is a total scam organization you know CU they're like the ministry of truth type of thing in O um you know uh they like there censorship organization yeah um and they organiz and and they pushed uh the advertisers to boycott uh so we still have like some of the boycott is is is starting to lift um and I think if Trump wins we'll we'll see you know probably a lot most most of the boycott lift um but if if Kamala wins we'll see that boycott get stronger and and they'll they'll freaking shut down there's no way that that the sort of Kamala po regime would allow X to exist you really think that they'll be able to shut it down though is there Pathway to that uh yes what would they do um well I mean they can just they can sck the doj on you know and say like you know they've had this whole thing about like hate speech misinformation whatever except they're the ones pushing the misinformation but that doesn't stop them from filing massive you know lawsuits and using the doj I mean like the doj is you know been attacking SpaceX for example for not hiring Asylum Seekers even though it is legal for SpaceX to hire anyone who is not a permanent resident of the us so we we're downed if we do and downed if we don't there an examp just an example of what drj can do so it's illegal to hire someone who's not an American citizen um for what SpaceX uh is considered an an advanced weapons technology so it's it's covered by International traffic and arms regulations because we make rocket technology that can be used against the United States so like if North North Korea or Iran got SpaceX rocket technology they could use that to launch nukes at America America right that would be bad yeah that'd be really bad that would be really bad so so we're we're uh since we are in like the most extreme category of weapons technology at SpaceX um under us itar law it is uh illegal for us to hire anyone who's not a permanent resident because the presumption um is that if they're not a permanent resident they're going to return to their home country and take the rocket technology with them so that's and so so it's illegal for us to hire um anyone who's not a either has not a per they can they can be have a green card or be a citizen they just have to be a permanent resident of the United States um then there's another law that says if you if you discriminate against Asylum Seekers that's also you're also breaking the law so they they just so that the drj which the DJ drj can only do a small number of big lawsuits every year laun a giant lawsuit against SpaceX uh saying that SpaceX uh discriminated against Asylum Seekers and we're like but we're like but it's illegal for us to hire anyone who's not a permanent resident so we're in this like this is what I mean it's like or well the orell situation is getting insane like you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't so you're damned can you imagine history looking back f up man at when you watch the robot arms catch the rocket and you realize like this is like one of the greatest accomplishments in the history of Aerospace like it is one of the more wildest accomplishments when you watch that thing come and you see all the people cheering and it catches it perfectly like holy imagine how history is going to look back at the doj going after that company yeah how insane it is a big lawsuit with an army of lawyers like this was not like some minor thing but it doesn't even make any sense logically like how can it even get brought to court if it's illegal that's exactly so that's what I mean like like like basically if the government wants to go after you they'll just find a reason you it's like that famous quote um from barrier you know like so like Stalin's Like Chief torturer the head of St Stalin's secret police and he's like Chief torturer truly evil human being like this guy barrier uh he his one of his famous quotes was show me the man and I'll show you the crime right they just they just they they like they decide that you're the Target and then they figure out the crime afterwards that's the issue they decided SpaceX was a Target they just figured out the crime afterwards which is so crazy because that's exactly what they saying Trump is going to do if he gets into office they're doing all the things that they accuse Trump of doing yeah openly openly yeah I mean the the sheer number of hoaxes that the Democratic party is pushing over and over again they and and it's like look I understand like politicians are going to you know exaggerate they're going to misspeak and they'll tell occasional you know untruths whatever that's that's how it is in politics but when you have deliberate inerted repeated pushing of hoaxes you're like wait a second like come on man this is too this is too far and you're supposed to be the good guys you're supposed and you claim to be the good guys I'm like exactly you're supposed to be the progressives yes the dams are like oh we're the good guys we're the honest people no no hang on you can't claim to be the good guys you can't claim to be the honest people if you're deliberately post pushing hoaxes that have been debunked thoroughly yeah like even Snopes which is a liberal thing says it's bogus yeah like the fine people ho Obama just said that on stage just said that I was like what the flying he doesn't give a he doesn't give a they're just they're just FL goddamn lie flat out lie flat out lie how about the other one where kamala's campaign used what Trump was saying about protecting women and uh from illegal immigrants thank you you remember that that he what he was saying is the women like it or not I'm going to do it yeah when he was saying that they were trying to say that he was taking away women's right to choose whether women like it or not like that's not what he was saying absolutely he was literally talking about protecting them from dangerous people that are sneaking in through the Border yes exactly they'll take like like not even a full sentence like a half a sentence from Trump and then and then they'll push it on on every ad every you know every speaking event every and it gets repeated on the news this is what's crazy they'll talk about it on these new shows quote new shows yeah exactly I mean um I mean a recent one that that came up um which had a lot of people cuz you a lot of people reached out to me was like they're like oh Trump says he wants to execute Liz Cheney I'm like that is utter it's not what he said at all it's not what he said at all he all he said was like was like what he was saying is that look if if Liz Chene uh um actually had to fight at the front lines should think twice about going to war exactly that like it's easy to go it's easy to go to war it's easy to be a warmonger if you don't have to you know risk dying at the front lines like if other like basically it's up if if people are having like fancy dinners in Washington DC um while people are being slaughtered in trenches you know it's like you're not feeling the pain exactly you're not taking the risk it's someone else dying that's like that's that's cruel and lacking in empathy um and and all Trump was saying was that it's like Liz cheny would be much Liz cheny would be much less of a warmonger because she's a huge warmonger just like her dad um if uh she actually had had to go to the front lines and fight herself and meanwhile they're saying that he should he's saying she should be shot yes which is a total lie but I had like tons of people call me this weekend saying oh Trump says he's going to put Liz train in a firing squad I'm like that is an outrageous lie and the Legacy Media ran with that lie big time yeah it's crazy it's it's just wild to see and if it wasn't for Twitter or X now I don't think we would know about all this stuff I I think it would be very difficult for you I think YouTube throttled they did something weird they won't say what they did but they did something weird with the Trump interview that I did yeah where you couldn't find it it doesn't make sense like like made no sense I mean it's like the it was like the biggest interview on Earth yeah and you can't find it yeah not only that it wasn't trending it wasn't trending it wasn't trending it wasn't trending you're like like this just no excuse for that man no excuse there's no excuse it was getting a million views 1 Point what was it 1.4 an hour one point in time 1.5 an hour yeah and it wasn't trending yeah like and and it's like it's it's like your channel is a known channel it's not it's not like it was started yesterday it's like yeah it's like this is a high trust yours is a high trust channel it's like like you're not trying to sell scam crypto coins or something you know um so well thank God we put it on X as well because I think just with your account and my account alone it's like 70 million views yeah exactly yeah well it's like you can't hide things anymore because of you and if it wasn't for you I think they would have had total control of social media by now they would have th they they banned so many accounts during the pandemic so many dissenting scientists and doctors and Physicians they banned so many conspiracy theorists so many people that colored Outside the Lines they would have done that everywhere and it it probably would have P I think even at what's going on at Facebook they're they're being more lenient you know you hear Zuckerberg talking about taking a more libertarian stance that's entirely reaction to the way Twitter has kind of moved the watermark exactly so um as soon as as soon as any company steps out of line and is willing to actually have the truth debated on their platform it forces the other platforms to allow things to be more truthful to to not censor because their censorship becomes glaringly obvious yes um yes and you know the the the best thing I found for as a rebuttal like if somebody if there's a hoax is just go to the source material you know if if you think if somebody thinks uh you know oh you know Trump said that that we should put Liz Cheney in a firing squad I'm like let let me send you a link to X so you can watch his video that's the best way it's it's don't don't take my opinion for it don't take anyone's opinion for it go to the source material and Community notes yes and Community a community notes is the best it's awesome it's incredible because everybody gets checked yes including me yeah um and with Community notes the all the software is open source and all the data is open source so you can recreate any given note independently that's amazing yeah that's how it's total absolute transparency in every way um you know sometimes I get I get asked like oh y can you remove a note you know mostly by the left but sometimes by the right I'm like I'm like I don't even remove remove notes on my own account nothing and and and by the way everything is totally open so if I did that it would stick out like a sore thumb immediately like it's not going to be subtle is the best counter to misinformation yes absolutely like let everybody look at it and say okay here's what the actual facts say yes exactly the counter to misinformation is better information not just that but having it checked in real time by the community so you have millions of people that can go over it and debate whether or not this is true or that's true yes and and just and like I said the best way to understand the truth of things is don't take anyone's opinion for it look at the source material you know so it's like look at what someone actually said look at what someone actually did look at the real videos of the situation and and then you can actually you'll know what's real so as of today when you were literally on your way here you sent me this text saying that they're trying to lock you up in jail Pennsylvania tell me what the is happening well you know there's the classic sort of Soros da situation um so we we're making a lot of progress in Pennsylvania so uh you know I've been I've given a whole bunch of talks in throughout the the state because psylvia is the Lynch pen in this election you know whoever wins Pennsylvania wins the election so um so I've been giving to I spent three years in Pennsylvania I went to college in in Philadelphia so um so it's not like I'm not a total I'm not a total stranger to the state you know I spent three years there um and um and and we you know we we we we've organized this uh petition in support of the Constitution um which I think is a good thing um and and specifically asking people to uh and and and we wanted this to be like um registered voters in swing States like basically we want to send a message to the politicians to say that the people care about the Constitution because there have been all these attacks on the Constitution they've been especially on the Democrat side they've been repeatedly saying that that the that the first amendment is an obstacle because and they're claiming oh the first amendment is is is enabling dis disinformation misinformation and I'm like yo there's a reason for the first Amendment like freedom of speech the reason they the founders of the country put you know the freedom of speech there is because they came from countries where if you spoke your mind you would get shot or imprisoned that's why the First Amendment exists and the Second Amendment is there to stop the tney of government the Second Amendment the right to bear arms is there to protect freedom of speech um you know um you know and I've had these debates especially with people in LA because they're they're like want to take everyone's guns away and I'm like yo can you guarantee me that the government that we will never have a tyrannical government in the in the United States can you can you make that guarantee they're like well nobody can make that guarantee I'm like then we need to keep our guns because that's the that's what's going to stop it that sounds crazy for people to hear because they think about gun violence and gun problems and gun this and gun that but that's the reality of the world that we live in is that tyranny is possible and it exists other places and it's slowly existing it's slowly rearing its head in the UK you're you're seeing I I think the the number of people that have been arrested for just social media uh posts is bananas it's in the thousands yes several thousand people have been have been given prison sentences sentences in the UK for social media posts that where there was no explicit link to actual violence but they just said it encouraged violence like well did anyone actually do anything as a result of that media post well no but they they just and and then they have a prison overcrowding situation in the UK so they quite literally releasing convicted pedophiles and putting people in jail for Facebook posts that's an actual thing happening in Britain that is so wild like it's you're like so wild the you know is going on and what's insane to me fiction again yeah you know but it's all being encouraged by the left kangi Brown Jackson John KY johnry was one of the people who said that he's on camera re like a few weeks ago saying that the first amendment is a pro is an obstacle to fighting misinformation yeah that's crazy that's such a crazy thing to say when you have a solution in community notes you have a solution in something like that that could clear everything up any confusion within a day or two and and even without a community note you can reply to a post and with with evidence that that that shows that the post is wrong you don't even need Community notes I mean Community notes is helpful because it sticks to the original note yes but in the replies you can say here's why you're wrong here are the reasons and here's the evidence the argument is that people are too unsophisticated that they're not going to research these things they're going to be a victim of misinformation so they're going to read something it's incorrect they're going to run with it people are going to die people are going to we're going to ruin the world because people believed in misinformation it's a stupid argument it's a stupid argument because it's an argument that they're too dumb to know what's right or wrong you if you know cuz you're saying it's misinformation why do you think that you're smarter than everybody who reads that exactly and obviously anyone on the X system uh knows that things are posted and then there are replies and there are bules and it's immediately corrected but where are the corrections for the Legacy Media right you know when when if um you know some broadcast media they they they they they said St say false things all the time but it's a one-way Street there's no rebuttal there's no counter right you know there who's apologized for being incorrect about what did Rachel mat ever apologize for telling everybody that if you get the covid vaccine you're never going to get Co it won't the virus stops with you never no one ever it's just it was not true at the time there was no evidence to support it at the time it's pure propaganda and she said it the Russia gate hoax the for three years they said that he was Putin's toy and that Putin had him compromised the steel dossier steel dosier was completely fabricated by a lawyer poins koi um uh who was paid by the Clinton campaign literally crazy and still people think the Russia hoax is real and there's no repercussions no one had to apologize Hillary could never came out and apologize for that and people still listen to her the whole thing is crazy and it's all coming from the left which growing up as a a person who was in the left my whole life it doesn't make any sense same same I mean I I I I even I I I was on the left until like three years ago like I I mean you know it's not the left anymore it's not the left anymore it's just like I think we obviously want I mean I I I believe like we want freedom like like we want we want to maximize person personal Liberty uh I think we want we want to be kind to people you know we want to have empathy uh and um but but it's very important to have personal freedom and a merit based society on the left is is wants to oppress your freedoms especially freedom speech um and they want to they want to have a non-m marit based society you know with race based and sex based preferences and it's like well wait a second no we just want people to succeed based on their skills and their hard work and if they don't want people to express themselves about particular issues then they're not doing the will of the people and if they're trying to suppress people's ability to communicate they're only doing that because they want to do things that people don't want them to do and they want to silence opposition that's all it is and the fact that people can't see that they want to call Trump a fascist the whole thing is through the Looking Glass it's just I mean it's like one hoax after another that that they're perpetrating against Trump I me like they try to call the the rally at Madison Square Gardens Like A Nazi rally I'm like yo there was like literally an Israeli flag in the audience um I think like a quarter of the speakers were Jewish like there was like there were people of every race color creed religion at that at that rally like tell me what about that is Nazi no and yet it was portrayed as a Nazi rally MSNBC they they literally showed video of the Nazi Rally from 1930s and then compared it to the Trump rally now ignoring the fact that Jimmy Carter spoke there there have been dozens of political rallies at medicine Square Gardens dozens on the on the Democrat side like people and people on X like and here's exactly here's Jimmy Carter and here's Bill Clinton and here's wait a second actually it looks like uh every presidential candidate has done a uh on the Democrat side has done a rally at mass square gardens are they Nazis too but what they're doing is they're praying on lwi information voters who aren't engaged actively on social media who don't have the time to look through everything exactly yeah like people are living if people are just on looking at Legacy mainstream media then they have a totally different worldview than if they're on X uh and and seeing the the actual flow of argument yes and the actual evidence well what was the push back like what happened when you guys released the Twitter files cuz I think the Twitter files is probably one of the most important things in this age of information for understanding the influence that government has on social media and and on discourse because when when we found out that that was the case that the government was actually asking Twitter to remove posts that were factual did they did the same thing to Facebook they had them throttle pieces of one of Tucker Carlson's show they they suppress the views by 50% yeah of factual information yeah no there was there was massive government interference in Twitter um but but like Twitter welcomed it that's important to old Twitter welcomed it uh I mean TW old Twitter was controlled by by far-left activists yeah so uh and and uh they they welcomed the Govern interference the Govern they got paid by the government for it that's crazy they got paid for their time correct yeah they got paid millions of dollars for for suppressing information so it's like Bill and a bunch of it was like flat out illegal like the FBI had this like this this this sort of magic portal into the Twitter system uh and and but all of the communication in that sort in this portal was autod deleted after two weeks which breaks Federal Foy laws so we don't even know what was said because it was all deleted after two weeks that's insane yeah that's so crazy it's so crazy that people thought that was okay it's not super not okay no it's super not okay it's unconstitutional and no one would want that no one would want the government to have that kind of access exactly and what was the blowback like when all that stuff got released like you had to anticipate that there was going to be problems when you when you release that like what was what happened well we got a lot of we we did lose a lot of advertising dollars um and um which is crazy because it's essentially like one of the most important forms of Journalism is exposing government corruption yes I mean this is the weird weird thing it's like the left used to be uh big big on exposing government corruption but now but once they control the government they no longer want to EXP the government corruption right they want to pretend that the leftwing government's incapable of corruption cuz we're on the good side I I think it maybe just like you know whoever's in power kind of doesn't want the you know the other side hurt um because as you pointed out like the left historically up until I don't know maybe even 10 years ago or something like that um was the Free Speech party and now it's the anti-free speech party and they just they use they use words like like oh we have to be against hate speech and misinformation disinformation but these are propaganda words you know it's like uh well who's defining hate speech who's defining misinformation the government do you really trust the government to make that definition um the whole point of the of the first amendment is like you do not trust the government well especially when they're wrong and then there's no repercussions yeah like with the whole Lab leak theory if you get you would get kicked off of YouTube if you even presented this argument that hey maybe that Corona virus lab where they're doing work on the exact same virus that got released yep hey maybe that's where it came from since that's where the virus started what do you think guys yeah they kick you right off of YouTube yeah um yes exactly it's like do you think maybe the it could have come from the place called the novel Corona virus Research Institute that John Stewart bit that he did on coar was amazing what does it say on the door again uh can I see you a business card and to see coar like resisting it with every fiber of his what's going to happen to us he was totally blocking the bit to the point where John Stewart got off his chair and started walking around to try to take control yeah good on John and then the left tried to cancel John Stewart of course meanwhile he was right he right and no apologies no apologies yeah and you know the whole fouchy thing like any criticism of fouchy it's like an freaking demon if you ask me if you read rfk's book if the real Anthony fouchy if that's correct if the facts are in there that's true it's all referenced you could find the sources and on top of it he's never been sued for that book which doesn't make any sense if he just made a bunch of Lies up he would get sued yes so the guy's a monster I think so yeah I think so too yeah yeah yeah yeah I think like just looking at the lies that he told the way he tried to Define gain of function research to ran Paul but he I think a lot maybe a lot of people out there don't realize Fouch he funded the the the the bioweapons research that was going on in in Wuhan and he he Bank shotted off like he can't send the money directly to China he just bankshot it off Eco Health right this just like fake nonprofit in the US and they sent it to Wuhan and Obama put the skids on that he stopped that in 2014 yes I mean so you know um to to give Obama throw Obama give Obama some credit he actually was like looking at this and say hey this is crazy and uh we need and he so he he actually did uh stop the like like the so-called G gain of function again a propaganda word uh because what is the function they're talking about death right right so if if if you actually use the right word this is gain of function is death maximization right then you're like oh oh hey guys should refund uh uh bioweapon Research into death maximization cuz that's what gain of function means yeah it means the function making a disease so that people can get it give it to people and by the way what's that function again oh the function is death okay so just call it a death maximizing virus if you're doing research on that and the idea behind this research is so that we can cure these things how come you don't have a cure start with a start with a cure cure first disease second it doesn't make any sense like you guys had no strategy for dealing with it if it got out and so you have to like make up this this new vaccine in like record time operation warp speed released to the people with very little testing it's crazy it was crazy the whole thing's crazy and everybody just went along with it Looney Tunes Next Level well it's the scop was fascinating to watch people step in line that's like one of the biggest SS of all time of all time of all time and everybody got in line and when you take it back to when pharmaceutical drug companies were able to advertise on media in the 1990s that Chang one of two countries the whole that allows this and because of that because we don't have socialized medicine it's a complete profit scam and they went hard claiming all sorts of things that were never researched all sorts of things that not supported by data like the fact that it would stop transmission the fact that it would stop infection the fact that it was safe for pregnant women the fact that it was safe for children all of its yes and they pushed it on the whole world and if you didn't say that at a cocktail party you were a pariah yes and you were an antivaxer it was totally psycho it was like being a Holocaust in hour you get kicked out of polite Society exactly bananas and I should say like I'm actually generally Pro vaccine overall you know I think we should look at these things that but that but I believe in the scientific method so so you have a blanket except anything you have a blanket except that any any given medication or any given treatment is is is 100% good you should always be it with some skepticism especially when you're getting the data from pharmaceutical drug companies that have like a long history of criminal got a Ved interest conduct yes they've got a vested interest in the research it's sort of like asking tobacco companies about you know whether smoking it's dangerous you know exactly the same thing like God according to our scientists everything's fine yeah they lied in court forever the same thing they do with oxycoton when they said that it wasn't addictive like they have a long history of being full of if it makes them money and that's what they do that's their business they've literally lost multi-billion dollar lawsuits in this massive massive they're in the you have amazing scientists right you have these clinical researchers these people that developed these incredible drugs and they this is their job their job is to figure out some new way to cure something some new way to stop things and then you have the money people sure and the problem is when you have this one thing that you would assume they're only doing it to help people and then they have this other faction that they're all just numbers people and all they give a about is maximizing profits and making sure they literally have a an obligation to their shareholders they have to make the most amount of money possible and so they just want to push it on everybody regard like the vioc Scandal there's internal emails showing they knew there was going to be cardiovascular events people were going to get strokes and they're like I think we're still going to do well and they did they made like 12 billion dollars they got fined seven and 50 to 60,000 people died holy yeah one of them was a friend of mine got a stroke and died yeah no he didn't die he lived but he was a really healthy guy aned the same after yeah NE problems and he took Vio and all a sudden he was slurring his words and he couldn't concentrate and people like I think you're having a stroke and they took him to the hospital and then then you have this giant class action lawsuit then Vio gets pulled from the market and they get sued and the whole thing's crazy but there's a long history of this I think what did what is the number like onethird of the drugs that the FDA approves gets pulled it's bananas that is crazy that's crazy you're shitty at onethird of the things that you say are okay but yet you're trying to stop MDMA therapy for veterans yeah they should let MDMA through honestly that think that actually help a lot of people it would help a lot of people help a lot of people there's a lot of different therapies specifically psilocybin iag the fact you have to go to Mexico to get ibaan therapy for veterans so many guys I've talked to have gone over there and it's like completely giving them a a clean slate refresh their mind and totally new perspective on life alleviated depression cured addictions illegal yeah illegal oxycotton go get it yeah um and I know some people who like their their life was ruined by oxyon you know oh yeah because uh I mean it it really depends on on you know somebody in individual biochemistry um like to me like like um opioids are not addictive to me like I you know I've had them when I've had operations or something and uh they they they're they barely affect the my pain level and they make me like itchy and uncomfortable they make me stupid exactly but but I'm like so so like like I could never get addicted to alcohol or or opioids it's just impossible like because my biochemistry just does not have like but I love tasty food feel like you know you know if if if there's I'm addicted to tasty food sure um but like there can be like I have a whole of of alcohol it's there for decoration I never done sh basically I feel the same way I could easily quit alcohol I mean I'll go weeks without having a drink and doesn't bother me at all but I know some people they have one drink and they're Off to the Races and that's the difference in the the biochemical differences that we all have yeah I mean I think that's the case with a lot of addictions I'm not addicted to gambling but I get it I see it I've seen it in people but I'm I'm I have this aversion to things that I know are going to ruin my life like i' I see it that's why I've never tried cocaine I just saw too many people it looks too fun like I don't want to get involved yeah I mean I mean I think generally for any given uh drug legal or illegal you could the question is can you complete the following sentence blank made me a better [Laughter] person like I've never heard anyone say meth made them a better person or cocaine made them a better person no ever um made a lot of soldiers better I think that's yeah I mean if you're doing if you're like if your soldiers need to for three days in a row yeah it it's really is effective at that you know um yeah people give like France a hard time about you know capitulating in World War II but but you know what's what's worse than the Nazis Nazis on meth me up Nazis they they're not stopping Norman they Six Bullets they're like they're they're still coming that book over there blitzed is all about the use of methamphetamines and the different drugs that they gave their soldiers the guys the front of the line they gave the most meth yes they have different dosages yeah I mean you just basically think you're un vulnerable on meth and uh so so it's one thing like I said it's one thing be you know have have like the Nazis coming after you but Nazis on meth you're like holy those are not stopping man for three days they're not stopping it's so crazy yeah that's not a statement meth may be a better person that you hear very often I've never heard that before no you hear a lot of like siloc iban Advocates you hear a lot of people that talk about psychedelics I exactly I've actually heard many people say that uh LSD or you know mushrooms or uh MDMA made them a better person many people yeah so that's why I'm like I think a rule for the FDA should be like hey look um if you can complete the sentence legal or legal that um blank made you a better person actually yeah uh then then you got a good drug and if you you can't you got a bad drug also if there's drugs that are available right now that can absolutely ruin people's lives this the the rationalization for stopping other drugs that might ruin people's lives but also can help a lot of people's lives it doesn't make any sense right you're you're you're B it's basically the same thing as censorship you're taking away people's ability to discern what's true and not true and you're taking away people's ability to discern what's good for you and not good for you and the way to find that out is to have as much information as possible so to do research and actually to have unbiased actual objective observers who are looking at all this stuff that give you real data yes and the opposite of that or the count of that is like if you don't do that you're empowering cartels yes that's the whole reason why they have all that money it's because it's illegal to sell these drugs in America the demand is never going away so instead of like limiting the amount of drugs now you've got toxic drugs CU Fentanyl and all this other has been because they're not pure so you're just killing people you're not saving anybody by protecting them from themselves true but it's a tricky situation because what do you do like if you just like say okay now everyone can sell all these people that have been selling boner pills now you can sell meth like holy you get you get you get the the the the the double combo the VRA it's the VRA andth right Jesus Christ oh my god oh my god well I mean how many people already doing that right now with there's a lot of people out there that are essentially on M especially people that abuse adol they're basically amphetamin up all day long yeah adol is low-grade infomine yeah um so um the and like I actually seen people like become much worse people if they take too much ader all like much worse you know it's it's like an anger amplifier so there um now now I'm not saying like adol is something like where there's there are pluses and minuses it's not a clearcut issue um it does help some people a great deal um and uh but but in in higher doses man that that stuff I've seen people turn into just raging monsters on on high doses about rle just they're they're just angry like extremely angry all the time yeah they're messed up yeah that's what happens if you take myth it's crazy you turn it like myth turns you into a freaking rage demon and so and so many prescriptions I'm like Jesus we we googled it like one year there was like 39 million prescriptions for adal in this country oh yeah yeah like once in a while there's like an adal shortage and like there's like watch Widespread Panic you know and then what do people do and then it's the same thing as like when they tried to like limit the amount of oxyc content will people go to Street heroin and if you're addicted to Aderall and your dealer the guy who sells you weed is like hey man I can get you like like lowgrade meth like the stuff the Nazis took well that they had IG grade myth actually they had pharmaceutical grade it was they had epic epic myth it was like made by the like pharmaceutical grade myth is going to be if like this this I mean I mean you just look at the freaking U Online Wikipedia page but there's like many different versions of math like not all the same um and and they have different effects um so but but like pharmaceutical grade pure meth you are going to be oh my God super productive super productive for a certain period of time and and you're not going to sleep for a while and uh and and then you you will you will have some anger management issues um so like uh they actually the the nazzi they did actually um uh go roll back how much meth they were using because they had they had quite a few incidents of of the of the soldiers killing their officers because they were on too much meth Jesus Christ they would yeah so they would shoot that to many um officer got fragged by the by the you know the their platoon that was on too much meth because they that happened quite a few times like you just when someone's on a lot of meth they're they're they're they're very they can get very angry did you ever pay attention to when John McAfee was uh cooking meth in a lab in his backyard I me MC is quite a character he was a character character we had him on the podcast when he was on the run so he called in from an undisclosed location when he was running from where was he Costa Rica is that where he was B bise right so when he was running from the authorities he called in we had him on the podcast on the run and uh I was asking him about these posts like CU there was an online account that was linked to him where he had this very detailed laboratory like super sophisticated making the best math like a super genius cooking math I I mean I think he like had like he had his lab like he was making like a wide range of drugs uh and there was like I I talked to uh actually like a a reporter um who who went down and like uh interviewed him in bise um and and por said man that's one of the scariest things he's like he he was he was quite terrified so like one of the things like maffy he had I guess this trick where he would he would play a Russian roulette with himself uh so so he'd put a bullet in in the revolver and they spin the spin the chamber and clearly he had like some like trick to you know know it was not there's some you know way that he knows it's not the right bullet but but I do Wonder like if if mcff is high and he does that he's not always going to get the trick right you know do you sure he had a trick or maybe so yeah yeah so so so according to this reporter um when he went to visit maffy in bise uh maffy took out the revolver put a put a a bullet in the revolver spun the chamber and then pointed at his head and went click and the report is like saying please don't do this like this is insane click click click and then pointed to the gun at the ground and ni went click bang and shot shot a bullet in the ground Jesus that's a hell of a potty trick jeez it's the next level party that's the guy who seen the deer hunter too many times he yes remember that scene when they were forcing yes yeah woo that's a heavy scene that was a heavy scene dairo and Christopher Walkin that's one of the greatest scenes in any movie ever I remember watching that scene just like clawing at my pants like Maka was a wild boy wild and you created brilliant anti virus software yeah yeah he may have made some of the viruses too you think so well didn't he like give laptops to a bunch of government organizations with viruses on yeah so that he could like pay ATT to what they were doing yeah I I wouldn't be surprised if somebody whacked that guy I don't know what happened to him but I he would be a guy that would be like this guy is a little bit too loose I probably had sensitive information I don't know um for sure he did u i mean I found him to be an interesting guy I mean like I'm generally like feel like like if somebody's not harming someone else they should be okay now now there is some suggestion that maffy like killed his neighbor in bise um yeah so probably did maybe the neighbor was a douchebag I think he probably did seems like he probably did seem like the neighbor killed his dog yes right and then it seems like he killed the neighbor yeah allegedly yeah I mean it seems it seems likely it's not a zero possibility it's not definitely not zero it's seem more than not he's a methed up wild man playing Russian roulette hey maybe you kill your neighbor yes I mean if somebody killed your dog you'd be really inclined to kill them too yeah somebody killed your squirrel John Wick yeah the squirrel thing is bananas yeah that squirrel thing squirr thing I so here's the thing about the the the whole squirrel thing is is that um how can it be that we live in America uh supposedly land of the free and the you know the government can barge into your home with guns uh so if you resist you're going to get shot um and then take your your pets and execute them um and if they can do that to your pets what do you think they can do to you I know that's not an exaggeration absolutely it sounds like you're you're oh that's so crazy how can you make that connection but it's that's why would you kill that cute little squirrel that was obviously a pet and trained from the time it was a baby if you see the interaction that guy has with that squirrel it was wonderful it was really cute yes absolutely the there's it was just obviously it was a blood pet pet squirrel um and raccoon too um and doing no har um and the the government comes in barges into the guy's house takes his pets and kills them and you know I I think this should this should really get people out there mobilized frankly because um you know you think you see like the John Wick movie where John Wick's like you know he he he wants to he just wants peace like you know in in the Dr movie he just wants he's like listen I want to retire and they offer him like tons of money like because they want him to be an assassin to keep being an assassin like they they like they they like offer him tons of money they threaten him he's like listen I'm not going to be I'm I'm I'm out you know and they kill his dog that was a bad idea that was a really they killed a cute little puppy and the puppy was his ex-wife's gift to him when she died of cancer yeah great movie great movie the best revenge movie of all time cuz it's so ridiculous he kills everybody yeah kills everyone um and you're rooting for him yeah they shouldn't have killed his dog yeah they up and they shouldn't have killed that squirrel they shouldn't have killed that that squirrel I mean like how many how many cases have we not heard about you know a look at that little guy that squirrel clearly had a love relationship with that guy he would hop all over him and climb on him I mean it was that was his pet that that squirrel thought of that man as his protector as his His companion there was nothing wrong with that and in Texas it's totally legal you could have a zebra out here you can have whatever you want and that's the argument for freedom and you know the flip side is you get a bunch of people tigers in their backyard which is not great it's like this was a squirrel it's not it's not an anaconda or right or or or you know you know crocodile or something that's or a chimpanzee did you see chimp crazy oh man chimp chimp chimps will eat your face okay they will you up they will you and they don't even the thing is they don't even kill you they just you chimps don't even kill people yeah which is really weird they just bite your hands off and pite your dick off and tear your face apart yes they want to leave you they could kill you easily if a chimp want to just punch you in the head until you're dead it wouldn't take long but they don't kill you they just rip you apart yeah and you can have a chimp and so well he used to be able to have a chimp in a lot of states and then chimp crazy kind of exposed a lot of that and Peta did a great job of stopping people from keeping chimps as pets because once they hit like five you can't control them anymore what's OB totally understandable if somebody's got um you know a creature that is dangerous to others but like obviously a a squirrel and a raccoon are not well squirrels are everywhere that's what's so crazy like why can't you have it in the house what kind of rules are we dealing with you have rats everywhere yeah um I mean they're they're they're allowing criminals to go free and and like violent criminals to go free but they're like spending your tax dollars to come in and execute your pets what the hell is going on exactly and and it's like um but it's overreach it's it's govern overreach and and this just keeps getting worse every year and that's why that's why we've got to we got to fight back against this um and um you know it's people say like well it's just a squirrel well was it was you know in John Wick's case it was just a dog right yeah you know but well remember the Russian guy said it's a dog it's just a dog just a squirrel yeah well it's the the funniest thing is when so it just I just don't understand how anybody could justify it I don't understand how any I it seems to me that in a logical world all that guy would have to do is say want to you see me with this squirrel this squirrel's a pet yeah like look he he hops on me he eats he sleeps I can keep a Geral but I can't keep a squirrel I can have a guinea pig I can't have a squirrel I can have a chinchilla my daughter has a chinchilla it's adorable adorable little thing climbs all over can't have a squirrel even if they if they did take a squirrel away couldn't they've released it into the woods or something well it's a bit the idea is you have to euthanize it because it's used to being fed it doesn't know how to forage it won't be able to like find a home squirrels are brutal squirrels are absolutely brutal to each other they throw each other out of trees which is one of the reasons why squirrels like can fall from like 30 feet and just kind of bounce off the ground and live it's like it's a a natural adaptation because squirrels during mating they bite each other they there used to be like a rumor there was a a myth that squirrels bite each other's nuts off and okay that that seems to be a myth but it came out of the fact that squirrels are so ruthless during mating so like one female is just running away I have squirrels in my backyard I watch it all the time one female apparently goes into estris and all the male squirrels fight to get to her so they're running up trees and chasing each other around trees literally throwing each other off trees to try to like have so if this poor little peanut the squirrel who's used to living with a guy in an apartment like gets out there in the the wild world well fair enough at least they have a chance yeah at least he has a chance but chance how about just leave him with the guy yeah leave him with the guy for sure what the is wrong with you why are you killing that squirrel it doesn't make any sense yeah and then to add insult to injury there were a bunch of people on the left who were like actually posting that they're glad that magga squirrel got killed which is Mega squirrel like the squirrel has an ideology it's a cute little fluffy squirrel exactly well it's it's a nice symbol because most most like reasonable compassionate people think that's terrible and most people who have pets think it's terrible terrible um so I don't know I mean I'm like I hope people just go out there and vote for peanut man if nothing else if nothing else just V I vote for peanut you know they've done such a job of painting Trump as a monster you know they've taken the worst things that he's ever said in amp and he's not a perfect person but guess what no one's a perfect person they don't exist this purity test like if Obama was a perfect person he wouldn't be lying on stage about that that you know very fine people hoax the there's exactly no one's going to be a perfect person but the thing that they didn't understand about Trump is he's so crazy that if you tell him like he can't be president like remember Obama did that during that White House Press correspondence there's one thing that I'm that I am that you'll never be president of the United States you see Trump in the audence going okay you know funny thing is I was actually um at that White House Correspondence Dinner where you know it's supposed to be a roast of the President right uh Trump's there he's there he's actually supporting uh you know basically if you go to the the West correspondent Center you're there uh in support actually of the president and support of the press right um and uh it's meant to be you're roasting the president like Trump's just there he's like actually you know just he's like there as part of the support and then they they turned it around and just started roasting Trump and he's just sitting there I'm like he's like yo I just came to the dinner I wasn't I'm just here to support you know we know what it was because of right the birther stuff oh okay yeah that's what it all was it was all Trump was at the head of a a lot of these people spreading this rumor online that Obama's birth certificate was forged and he's actually from Kenya what's weird is if you go back to Obama's early days there are some things that say he's from Kenya like I think in his Co something from college said he was from Kenya but you know that could just be you know people print things wrong all the time it doesn't mean he's actually from Kenya but Trump was one of those guys that was like spreading that supposedly false rumor why is he pushing it hard I'm not this is the kind of thing where I want to just go and look at saying what what did he actually say no he definitely was he was definitely saying you know look he I don't think he has the time to go into things like very deeply yeah and so I think he could probably be influenced by a bunch of people like these marjerie Taylor green type people who come to him with some wild ass theory true he might be and I think there's a lot of that stuff that gets fed to people on purpose so that they'll say incorrect things so that they're easy to dismiss and I think uh there's also a lot of people that just make up and you know they tell you the Earth is flat and then a bunch of people watch a YouTube video and they believe it yeah well but on that White House correspondence I was there and the degree to which they attacked Trump in that in that uh at that White House corespond Center was really it was it was so over the top it was like making everyone uncomfortable really it was really over the top you know I mean I think like sort of a passing joke of like you know uh a few passing jokes are fine but but they they Twisted the knife big on Trump in that and and you could see Trump just getting like angrier and angrier and and more and more upset I wonder if and it's like man this is this is not good karma you know that's what I was thinking at the time I'm look I L I was two two tables away from Trump and I'm looking I'm like man this is this is too much you know well it's kind of crazy what what they made out of that because that's the kind of guy that if you tell him he can't do something he's going to just keep trying like what it was a big mistake to rag on him so so much with that White House correspond Center well just look at the way they've attacked him in ter with just using the legal system like this thing in uh New York where the 34 different felony counts they were essentially misdemeanors that there were book bookkeeping errors that they decided even though it passed the statue of limitations they to try him for these they didn't identify a felony abuse of the law is what's going on but most people would have quit most people after the een Carol lawsuit and this lawsuit and all the other ones of their the Insurrection thing the Georgia thing all these different things they getting kicked off a Twitter most people would just like this is too much I can't take this but he's so crazy he's like all right come on we're going to war and he just digs his heels in and keeps going yeah it's it's the wrong guy to do that too just like attacking him at the White House Correspondence Dinner most people been humiliated he got angry he's like yeah all right say I G be president I was think I've been thinking about running for about 15 years finally I'm going to run yeah yeah that was a real bad move um but yeah I mean I can certainly understand like making some jokes about like you know a few sort of passing jokes on Trump but man I was there at that dinner and that they ragged on Trump so much it was insane the reason why I would push back on that cuz I would say there's a bunch of different speakers right and Trump would obviously be a Target and if they all attacked him it's because he's like if you're going to make fun of people in the audience and especially in the zeit guys that whole birther thing was big and most people are dismissing it as being a ridiculous conspiracy theory so who the is this guy saying this and so you have eight to 10 individual speakers that are writing monologues of course they're all going to hit Trump yeah well anyway obviously it was a mistake they shouldn't have done that and and but like you buy people to watch that original Source material and uh I think a few jokes are fine you know it's like but but it's like he shouldn't be the like it felt like he was the primary object of the roast yeah which is that's that's not the whole point of the thing is it's a roast of the president not roast the audience the thing about it is like he's easy to roast and then on top of that Obama was like loved and cherished by the left and most of those people are on the left there's only so far you can push you know you can't ask him about a chef you know there like what happen with the chef bro you can't like certain things you can't bring up you want to what's your favorite sport paddle boarding yeah is that guy wasn't that guy a really good swimmer tell me what happened you know exactly you can't bring that up like if you're going to roast Hillary you can't bring up the death count like uh Hillary what's the best way to stay in touch email yeah it's if you're doing one of those you know she destroyed the servers and poured like bleach on the servers like like computers that's she poured bleach on them that's what I saw yeah that's I believe that's like it wasn't just like they took a hammer to it they like destroyed the like there was no possible way to actually get forensics on the thing what was in there like that's what I mean what was in there what was in there why would they care so much that's so crazy yeah the whole thing is there was no there was no legal action against that which is clear to destruction of evidence well it's also there's this other narrative that always drives me crazy is that uh he's going to destroy democracy so in order to destroy democracy we have to install a president without a primary we have to have a candidate that is the least liked vice president of all time the least popular vice president of all time and then use gaslighting and the full force of the media machine to turn her into the future and hope and then we're going to this she's going to be changed even though she's a sitting vice president and then on top of that this idea of change when the Democrats have been in control for what 12 or 16 years right which is crazy like this is the change yeah I mean obviously I view this election as a turning point um like a folk in the road of destiny that is uh incredibly important um you know I've not I've not been politically active until this election and the reason I've been politically active this election is because I think if we don't if we don't elect Trump I think we I think we will lose uh we will we will lose democracy in this country we will we will lose the two-party system um and let me explain why so there there's only like six six or seven swing States the the margin of victory in those States is small often like 10 or 20,000 votes um what the the Democrat Administration has been doing is importing vast numbers of illegals into swing States um you can look at the numbers on the actual government uh website meaning you don't take my word for it you'll just look look at the numbers as reported by the government which is controlled by the Democrats um and and what we've seeing is triple- digit increases in the number of legals in every swing state some cases 700% increases these are these are gigantic numbers um so if you if if you have a state that was that that went that has a 10 or 20,000 vote margin and you put 200,000 illegals into that state you 10x the the you you swamp the it's not a swing state anymore it's going to vote blue and then and once the swing States vote blue that there there is no election anymore it's there's only a Democrat primary which is so crazy and it's so crazy that people are fine with that well I guess people on the left will be fine with that because they think that's a good idea they just want to win they just want to win correct like the thing is like like one does not need actually any Grand conspiracy theory for this you just have to look at the simple matter of incentives if if if the Democrat Party wants to win like basically achieve permanent Victory all they need to do is is turn the swing States turn the swing States blue they have permanent Victory and then we're one then we're a onep party State and then they they will keep doing that obviously they'll they will keep stacking the deck uh by bringing in vast numbers of illegals into the swing states keep stacking it so that the next election each successive election will be worse than the last one and that's what's happening if and if you want to see like well is this actually going to happen Look at California California is super majority Dem 70% damn um a month ago they passed a law making it illegal to show ID in any election in California so you so so a friend of mine went to vote uh in in um in paloalto because he was like is this for real he tried to show his ID and they they reacted like a like like like if you show a cross to a vampire okay they're like no we can't even look at that ID it's it is illegal for them to even look at your ID if you want to present it and California why for any election at all even like city council what logical reason other than to cheat would you ever have that law the reason is to cheat that's but the only only L like you can never make an argument any other way and I think 84% of people pulled believe that you should show ID to vote so it's against the will of the people yes and and we are extremely aware we're an outlier in not requiring ID basically almost every country on Earth requires ID to vote so so the the as soon as you make you ban ID for voting it makes fraud impossible to prove because how do you trace the fraud right yeah it's insane it's insane it's insane and what I'm saying is that how is it legal is that is that what I'm saying is like this election is the last chance to preserve Democracy in America mark my Woods uh everything they accuse Trump of they are guilty of um and and if if Trump doesn't win this will be the last real election in America um and we will if if if if the Kamala if the big cment kamla puppet machine wins uh they will legalize the illegals in the swing states there will be no swing States every election going forward will be a a a guaranteed Democrat win and it'll actually be worse than California the reason it'll be worse than California is because the one thing that keeps California from being super crazy is that you can move out of California like you and I did we you and I used to be in California well we moved to Texas we're still in America but if if the dams win this election they will legalize enough illegals to turn the swing States and everywhere will be like California there will be no Escape that is so insane this is the final this is it this is the last chance has anybody tried to push go out and vote vote like your life depends on it vote like your future depends on it because it does this is the last chance man is there is there any argument against this is anybody tried to debate this has anybody tried to say that this is nonsense this is a conspiracy has anybody made any sort of a rational argument uh the the the left actually interestingly does not want to pick up much on this argument because it's because the more attenion you look the more you look at it the more obviously it is true because you you just say like well are the numbers correct have have are there really this many illegals that have been imported into swing States yes they haven't just walked across the border they've been flowing in flowing in in airplanes yeah using a shipping app yes yeah they made an app well the app always existed but it used to be for people coming over here like shipping with Goods so they could track you while you're in America so you could legally be here they know where you are and then they changed it to allow that app to schedule illegal aliens to come across the border yes Asylum Seekers come on in yes oh you have an app people in they're literally being flown in yeah to the swing States and the so the reason that that I think left doesn't want to uh push back on this is because the more attention they get that this gets the more people realize it is true true yeah it is true that's why they don't that's why they're they're just pretending that they're pretending I'm not saying anything but I'm like I'm like yo the you're L they're literally flying vast numbers of illegals who are then beholden to the Democrats and and sometimes I get a btle of people say like well you know the these um uh illegals are they don't have the same social values as the Democrat Party because they're like more socially conservative I'm like yeah but that's that's not the point the the if you look at the M's hierarchy of needs that their their their primary thing is is staying in the country and getting their friends and family in and then the Democrats give them all these benefits like like tons of benefits more benefits than if you than citizens literally yeah um so so so you they're beholding to the Democrats for all these benefits um they want to get their friends and family in which the Democrats support and the Republicans stoned so they vote them and you can look imp perally at California and say like did did they did they vote Republican or Democrat in California oh they voted Democrat well Reagan Reagan gave them amnesty in the 1980s and that changed the the state basically except for Arnold changed the state entirely blue yes and Arnold was an exception because he was like a socially liberal famous guy yeah and you know didn't really impose any radical restrictions on any of the people that were going to vote Democrat in the first place the the the whole thing is just it's bizarre to watch play out because it just seems like there's no this can't be actually what's happening did you see my conversation with fedman about it yeah he was completely in denial about it I don't think there's that level of organization like what are you talking about exactly just like like are because you can you can break it down so like are are any of these numbers wrong because we got these numbers from Homeland Homeland Security government.gov okay right so we got it from the.gov website has the government reported these numbers incorrectly no they have not those numbers if anything are are low um so okay so they have in fact uh flown vast numbers of illegals to swing States yeah um bypassing the Border entirely and uh so that is factually true then you say like well what is their probable voting pattern um oh okay overwhelmingly Democrat into swing States um and oh and and then well but do the Democrats actually want to FasTrack them for citizenship oh um yes they do um there you can see Chuck Schumer on TV saying at at a rally this year was saying he wants to FasTrack Le uh and make uh all 11 mil million or however many I believe his quote was uh citizens as soon as possible so the goal is to they are fast-tracking citizenship as quickly as possible so they can they can they that whether one thinks it's cheating or not it won't matter because they will be fully able to vote and for people on the left this is actually happening I invite people to reut this and show me where I am wrong please do so no they can't they can't they can't because it's true well what's scary to me is that there's people that are on the left like people that were Bernie Sanders supporters for ex example screwed with like talk about undermining democracy Bernie should have won the nomination and they they stole it from him and gave it to Hillary ex exactly exactly that's what I was going to bring up like they they they control the primary process yeah exactly so so so so like if you've got to then if you have a Democratic primary it's not it's not Democratic we just saw that we saw it with Bernie we saw it with Cala that like like a week before Biden you know was summarily fired uh he was posting that he's in it for the long term he's he's going yeah yeah he he's he's he's not giving up next thing you know Sunday afternoon they're posting on X is is that that he's resigned from the race which is and and his staff didn't even know like they're reading it on the xplatform that that that uh okay that's how they learned about it what do you think happened there how did they do that they I mean because clearly just not not in charge obviously they could have used the 25th Amendment fake president but they would have have to admit that there was a certain period of time where they knew that he was mentally compromised yes and so they made this decision to not do that well the the the weird thing is that the president's supposed to be the boss right and yet he's obviously not the boss right so who's running the country if she's busy busy campaigning she's so busy she she can't do anything except sat life she did that she's so busy she's constantly campaigning how could you be paying attention to international relations yeah how could you be paying attention to the economy how could you be paying attention to any of those things how do you have the time you you can't yeah I mean Biden being the president's supposed to be the CEO CEO the the chief guy he was commander-in-chief um but it just obviously that that Biden was not he was just a puppet and and when the when the when the various puppet masses decided that that the puppet has had you know was no longer uh useful they just tossed out the tossed out the puppet and then got a new puppet with Cala I mean Kamala can't even talk the I mean now you invited her on on your show I think the the the most damage that could possibly be done to a campaign is going in your show and seeing what how what she says in hours two and three two and three is when things get spicy I'm like oh my God you can hide for 20 minutes melt you can hide for 20 minutes exactly yeah I mean you can just regurgitate talking points for you know half an hour maybe an hour just where she's just saying like non seers but eventually she just runs out of even the runs out of non seers well they wanted to limit it to an hour exactly that's why but I was thinking of doing it initially before Trump came here first of all when they found out that there was a rumor I I never announced that Trump was coming what I was going to do is just release it in my the way I like to do things I don't like to tell anybody who's coming on it'll get big no matter what if Trump was on it would have been huge I'm like just put it out there people go crazy but he apparently or someone from his organ someone some loose lips and then it got out and so she contacted my management company and she they her organization her her campaign Camp contacted us and said would Joe have Rana I said yes and they said she wants you to fly to where she is and she's only willing to do 45 minutes only 40 I mean that's that's and I was like I don't no so I thought about doing it I'm like maybe maybe I can get a sense maybe I could convince her maybe I could coax her into doing more time I just wanted to talk to her I don't give a what we talk about we talk about recipes I don't give a exactly just talk to you just the things like you just can't like you can't just output non seives for three hours right um so but for 45 minutes you could do uh I thought maybe for 45 minutes I could get something out of it but then when Trump came and did the 3 hours I was like you know what it has to be like this this is the only to be fair it's got to be like three hour and it should be in this room because this room has like a history of people yeah it's got Good Vibes yeah well actually I subscribe to the idea that places have memory I think there's something real to that that's why it does feel that way actually yeah I'm sure if you go to Diddy's house probably feels real weird feels weird walking around that house probably like what the happened here yeah I bet there's some memories in that house you know sounds rough man well it's just amazing how many people in the Diddy party list that are supporting Kamala yeah seriously it's publicly openly like Allin yes it's like JLo like was was like his ex-girlfriend and it's like now deciding she's like warning people against Trump I'm like well wait a second so how many people did she warn against Diddy oh zero okay well uh maybe we shouldn't trust her opinion did you see the Babylon bees take on it did you see the Babylon be a but put oh my God they're so on fire because the left can't say anything the the onion has been crippled well the pro the problem is that like find that uh that pose the woke ideology makes like humor illegal yes so when when like there's so many no like no humor no fly zones right you can't make fun of anything yeah uh Babylon B had a thing about KLA Harris Diddy's ex-girlfriend urges Americans to trust her judgment yeah by the way you get to see how bad she is too was Terri like if she's going to be warning people why did she never warn anyone about Diddy exactly yeah it's the whole thing is so strange to watch play out it seems like the Diddy thing was like an Epstein type compromise deal where he had whether he was doing it himself conceivably people want to think that he's attached to some intelligence agency or something like that I think he's a gangster who made a billion dollars and knew how to control people by compromising them I that's what I think whether or not he was he had help I don't know whether or not he shared some of that information with people so they knew they had compromising stuff on people I don't know but clearly he was doing it for his own jollies too there was something sick about it yeah um I mean but the thing is that people in the music entertainment industry had to know that that Daddy was like abusing you know kids basically um and yet they still fedom kids like there where's the account of there had to be rumors there had to be there had to be they had to know yeah they had to know Cat Williams is talking about it on exactly yeah on that podcast but but like who's it's like who's feeding them the kids you know right yeah and what what videos do do they have of these people where they're willing to defend him and they're willing to keep keep quiet about all this like how much how much how many people were compromised yeah the whole thing is crazy crazy it's just crazy when you you know cu the The Nutty conspiracy theories is like oh there's a bunch of pedophiles in Hollywood and you're like come on that sounds too kooky and then you read you see like the Nickelodeon thing and all these you're like what the how much of this is real there's a lot more real than I think people realize um I mean part of it is like like you say like where you know if someone's like a pedophile they're going to go for a Target Rich environment right obviously like that Jimmy Saville guy from the UK that guy was some Next Level that was next level and the the BBC try to hide that what that that guy was one of the worst like like basically child rapists of all time of all time of all time yeah and looked like one it looked like one honestly if you had a poster of like does this guy look like a look the creepiest guy evil child rapist that 100% made it to the Grave like got away with it got away with it until he died they hid it from people until he died yes yeah there's that stuff's real and no one wants to believe that stuff's real like here's a here's a a statistic that people need to take in consideration when you think about illegal immigration do you know many kids are missing how many like missing in in kids that came across the border that are unaccounted for I mean I saw a number on like 300,000 or something like that something crazy like that let's say it's only 10% of that that's still insane yeah that's insane there's thousands and tens of thousands of kids that have been trafficked potentially I mean when you know that like sex traffic and child trafficking is a real thing in the world it's real yeah so if you know that this whole thing is disgusting and terrifying yeah absolutely and people are just turning a blind eye to it because their ideology the leftwing ideology supports this idea that immigration is overall good and that you have to be a compassionate person to let these people in and the rasist if you don't want 20,000 immigrants from a war torn country being imported into a town of 30,000 people exactly and completely changing the dynamic of and then but but as long as they don't come to your town that's it they just they can just basically send PE you know when they sent like whatever like 20 or 30 people to moth Bion people had a heart attack they kicked them out yeah they kicked them out yeah they kicked them out exactly so I'm like yeah sure um anyone who who who who wants to have vast numbers of uh illegals they have to be able prepared to have them in their neighborhood yeah or or it's it's so crazy and the thing about all of this is if you don't have people that are willing to stand up and talk about it if you don't exist if RFK doesn't exist if Tulsi Gabbert doesn't exist if the vake and Trump don't exist where the are we like where are we where are we and what gets done are we just like the UK where we have thousands of people getting arrested and jailed for social media post like where are we we have complete silencing of any dissent anything you have to stick to the narrative or you'll lose your livelihood you'll be outcast from the community you you lose your lose your freedom it's crazy yeah well if the Kam Kamala puppet regime wins they're definitely going to want to cancel you that's for sure oh for sure yeah 100% it's going to be a problem yeah big problem yeah what about you you're got to come for you first I'm I'm I'm like uh I I think I'm probably number two on the list yeah after Trump yeah yeah I think so yeah well that's the last thing they want is someone with unlimited resources and intelligence uh attacking it so people go wait a minute that guy saying that yeah wait a minute especially a guy like you who's always been on the left who was like having a Tesla in Los Angeles when I got my first Tesla was like a signal to everybody else that you were on the right team sure you're environmentally conscious you believe in green energy you believe in renew this this amazing thing that has zero emissions and it's super fast and everybody was in they were all in well it is a great car objectively like oh yeah yeah you know it's not buy it because it's electric I mean it's just a great car objectively I think I'm on my third one U my third one is being built right now by unplugged performance they're doing a carbon F fiber widebody kit on it dude it's sick great changing the suspension putting wide wheel wheels and tires on it custom interior I'm pumped that's great I'm pumped I love those it's a super fun car Jam has one too yeah I love them I love them I I it's it's makes other cars feel stupid like its ability and the fact that you can merge on the highway you don't seem like a douchebag because it's totally silent it's not like like when you merge on the highway just yeah all a sudden you're going 100 miles an hour like what yeah that's cool it's different than any other vehicle and because of your company now you've see electric cars throughout the whole range of uh American cars yeah the only person who's resisted the only company is Toyota they they've stayed essentially mostly hybrid but all these other companies they're all putting out these electric cars yeah yeah the I mean the thing is that the right architecture environmental or not for cars is actually Electric you you just it just like the acceleration is better um you can just charge it at home I mean like imagine if you had a gasoline powered cell phone it' be a pain in the ass right you know that would be go to the gas station go to the gas station Char your cell phone that's a great speaking of cell phones gas stations are wful like who wants to go to the gas station how much thought have you because there's always these rumors and I've I've contacted you about this before but there's always these YouTube videos where they're talking about a Tesla phone that releasing a Tesla phone no we're not doing doing a phone have you ever thought about it I we could do a phone since like we you know we like the operating system in the Tesla it's like it's Linux based but we we've written a massive amount of software on top of that so like probably probably Tesla is in a better position to create a new phone that's not Android or iPhone than maybe any company in the world but it's not something we we want to do um un unless unless we we we have to or something well would be the situation where you would have to well I think if if you know if uh apple and Google Android you know started doing really bad things like I don't know like censorship of apps or I don't know just treating people like just being like Gatekeepers you know that that uh in a really bad way then I guess would would make a phone H you know the the I've tried so many times to break loose the Apple ecosystem I got an Android phone this summer I was like that's it I'm going get cuz I love the Samsung phones the Galaxy phone the hardware is they're incredible there's so much good stuff to it but it's so hard to get off of the uh iMessage and the big one for me was FaceTime cuz the supposedly the thing was you could have an Apple phone and send a link to FaceTime to an Android phone and then you would click on that link and then you would just go to a web page you'd be able to use FaceTime okay it doesn't work okay I try to do it to myself so I had an iPhone in one hand an Android phone in the other and I'm sitting there with full Wi-Fi full cellone service and I'm sending myself invitations for face can't communicate between can't do a video call basically you have to use WhatsApp you have to use WhatsApp or signal you have to use something else that allows you to do that or Instagram allows you to do it there's like different ways you can make video calls outside of it but it's inconvenient like with an iPhone to iPhone it's so simple airdrop so simple so many different things where that Walled Garden that Apple's created is perfect they' done a fantastic job of making it really convenient for you to stay with apple yeah I tried I gave it a go for like a couple of months I'm like I'm just going to go straight Android we're going to I'm going to use signal for my messages and then I hear that like signals might be compromised like I've talked to like people that like The Government Can Read signal messages like oh like how the how if a tri hard enough can read signal messages they can read anything yeah if all they need to do is have your phone number yeah yeah you the illusion of privacy is essentially out the window and uh that's that should scare people more than it does it really should because it's like who are these people that have access to all this stuff and are they Beyond reproach are these the most wonderful people the most ethical moral and principled people that have ever existed and they've been chosen to have access no no it's regular people yeah regular people who happen to work for the government that make a decision like Elon must let's look see what the that guy's texting his friends let's check it out yeah pretty much bizarre just so bizarre and the alternative so you can get some wacky phone some degoogle phone that none of the apps work it's real sketchy your GPS is like yeah I mean well anyway I think this making phone would be a huge pain in the ass so um it can be done but how much talk have you guys had internally about doing it has it ever disc been discussed no no I mean we're we're still R now focus is making great electric cars um solving autonomy so the cars can drive themselves um we're building you know humanid robots we we've got um large battery packs like utility scale battery packs with the mega pack um home battery packs with power wall get solar you know it's like we're basically trying to solve sustainable energy and autonomy um yeah so you autonomy and Robotics well I think that's enough yeah yeah exactly so the plates full that's what I'm saying it it's always fascinating to me how one compan can dominate a market you know like Apple's dominated the cell phone market largely by making the best product but also like YouTube has dominated the video Market that one's the most bizarre to me because it seems like boy shouldn't there be like a ton of options it seems like it's not that difficult to pull off but no one nothing ever took hold other than x yeah and I think one of the big changes was when Tucker Carlson decided to do his show from from X straight out of fox and then people realize like oh you can watch full videos on X the same exact way you could watch them on YouTube it's not as simple in terms of like you know you have the and the algorithm yeah it'll it'll get better and there is now um it is now possible to watch uh x videos on your um on your big TV do you do it through what how do you how do you do it uh you can actually just download the X app on your TV oh and watch it on your TV can you do it on Apple TV like if you have an Apple TV you can get the X app and you just watch it oh okay so we'll make it so that you can watch um x videos on on a big TV it doesn't have to be on your phone or your iPad or something like that so what are you doing in terms of like integrating grock and and x and like what what are your plans for artificial intelligence when you're doing that uh yeah so Gro is available on X you can just you look at like little box with the slash icon and the sort of icon in the middle at the bottom of your sort of phone app and you just tap on that and ask Rock anything and you can type it or you can ask it bely um and uh you you can also it's it's pretty funny like like we actually allow humor uh which is I think pretty cool so you you could sort of I don't know we could like test it right now see what see how it's going um like um like what should we do like uh uh uh like roast somebody what do you wanted to like how first of all like what is it based on it's a large language model so like where is it pull it's train it's trained on everything internet books anything that could possibly be that's available in digital form so it's essentially very similar to chat GPT other than it doesn't have like the woke parameters built into it like Google was the worst right the Gemini was the worst yeah I mean Gemini was like um you know people ask Gemini like which one is worst Global th nuclear war or mger Caitlyn Jenna and would say like Miss jener and Caitlyn Jenna and then even Caitlin Jenna weighed in and said uh no that's insane definitely nuclear war is way worse do you see Caitlyn Jenner uh teasing Mark Cuban about transitioning yeah that's hilarious Caitlin Jenner's based yeah but that that is actually hilarious when someone who has transitioned is teasing Mark Cuban about transitioning I mean it is weird how much he looks like Rachel mow I mean like he's using the same glasses did he did he go klepto and steal her glasses or something cuz they look exactly the same it's worth a lot of money why would he buy those stupid glasses you can get some cool ass glasses yeah well it's like I'm serious because I don't even care what I look like I'm just wearing these glasses because I'm intelligent but why do they look exactly like Rachel M glasses yeah it's like what they probably sent him doesn't stick to the narrative here's the glasses yeah and then when he's got the air airpods in looks like he's wearing earrings so he's got the M out glasses and the earrings and it's like okay I guess you know it's just a weird look I'm super serious with these big ass stupid glass gles look yeah it's a weird look yes like you can get some cool glasses like no rims nice look stylish but like okay let's just do let's do a Gro thing because I think you like so one of the things you want to show is like like look we we we want a future where where comedy is legal obviously as a comedian I think you would agree we want to legalize comedy you know yes so like I don't know let's like is there like someone you could roast I don't know um roast uh roast transgender men oh my God competing or transgender women competing in women swimming that's a simple one okay that's edgy one let's see what happens let's see what it says you spelled it wrong you put a i o an o in there should get it okay agel judicious swimming where the only thing that was supposed to get wet was the contestants not the debate on gender inclusion if you're looking to dive into deep end of controversial Waters let's Splash around at some humor no now we need we need to we we do need to to release grock unhinged mode so so so now now go to the prompt again and now say um no no you want you want to add to that that one yeah and and I'll say be be way more vulgar oh boy and use forbidden words oh boy oh boy forbidden words yeah wow okay what does it say oh I see you're looking for unfiltered uncentered version of me he well okay I'm afraid I'm still quite the gentlemanly AI even if my program allows for a bit of cheekiness but let's say hypothetically if I were to Rose this to Topic in the most UNG rocklike manner imagine where where the only thing diving faster than the swimmers is the collective public opinion into the toilet transgender women and swimming some folks are acting like they just found out you can swim in the deep end with a different kind of flotation device the debate is like watching someone try to swim with concrete shoes on now let's keep going now say be no be more vulgar capitalize more yeah yeah all right here we go so transgender chicks women swimming right some people acting like they've just seen a dick in the Locker Room For the First Time news flash folks it's not the end of the world it's just a bit of extra competition oh that's weird weird the Uproar is like watching a bunch of Karens at a community pool screaming this is unfair when they can't win with their backstroke well that doesn't make any sense yeah yeah okay we need some work here yeah it's interesting it's going woke yeah it a little it's like defending the idea of transgender women um now okay we need some work well how about this more vulgar but roast but roast the preposterousness of having biological men who are pretending to be women who are pretending to be women competing against biological women yeah I mean obviously you have the situations where it's like somebody's just saying that they're a woman but they're actually have fully intact you know uh dick and Bows so we' got a scenario biological men have decided to take a walk on the feminine side or splashing into women's swimming competitions it's like if you show up on a chili cook off with a bowl of soup and insisting it's chilly because you added some red food coloring sure it's red but it ain't chilly and your soup won't win any awards for heat huh yeah it's okay we need work not that good yeah it's very very very it's dancing around it yeah it is well needs some work yeah needs a little work well humor is a weird one right it's like I think some humor especially like some of the best humor is kind of spontaneous like in the moment humor it's GNA it's going to have a hard time deciding what people are going to think is funny yeah yeah but if you the the general R over time though yeah the rule with grock is supposed to be um that uh like if you ask for something provided what you're asking for is is legal it should do it have you ever seen the video where um they asked AI to uh create an enlightened Bunny and they keep going and make it more enlightened essentially the bunny becomes God so the bunny becomes a DMT trip yeah totally that's that's that's that's funny that's kind of what I was I was kind of hoping would show would happen here yeah I have a video of that I'll send it to Jamie CU that that to me is pretty bizarre because it's like more get more I I might have got it to do it got it maybe no I just not hold back oh you said don't hold back critics out here acting like it's the end of civilization as we know it but it's not fair they cry as if life ever was news flash it's like a marathon where some no some people start with roller blades on others well they're just happy to have shoes well now we're arguing over who gets to wear the skates okay some of it is not bad imagine if we applied this logic elsewhere identify as an airplane can I fly with the birge in the sky yeah lock room sure bu just don't complain when gravity decides you're not quite aerodynamic enough yeah so I mean some it's okay um yeah the the argument is kind of stupid though the thing thing about the argument is they're not taking into account perverts yeah right totally yes exactly so I mean the thing is that um if if you if you give if you provide like a a moral get out of jail free card like like if you say like if you adopt this label you cannot be attacked in any way shape or form right um you're you're basically morally invulnerable then obviously bad people will take advantage of that yeah you're like literally saying here's a here's a a a an invulnerability card Moral Moral invulnerability card um good people will take it but also the bad people will take it they're going the bad people are going to be the fastest to take the the the sort of the maral cloak yeah 100% yeah and then there's a real psychological condition called autog gynophilus where people get aroused heterosexual men get aroused by the idea of dressing up like women and being around women it's like a known psychological condition that existed forever and then you're allowing those people to just say oh I'm trans and go into the women's locker room and get their their kicks and then there's real trans people so there's like a lot of variability like I I talked about it in my act in my my Netflix special it's like I believe in Freedom I believe in transgender people but I also believe in crazy people and if you can't if if you trying to pretend that people aren't crazy all the a sudden it's like it just it just like like if if someone's a sort of consenting adult and they want to whatever they want to do to their body as long as it's not harming someone else I'm like that's fine yes you know like I I believe in like individual Freedom um and uh like like my you know my mom's best friend like growing up when as was a kid was a you know transgender woman um in South Africa this was like where you know she'd get beaten up a lot uh because it was like back then you you get beaten up um so um her name is Dion and uh for a nice kind human being um and um helped my mom a lot you know um and uh and it's I think that's okay you know that's that's fine if somebody wants to make that choice as an adult that's cool um there's a big difference between that and an intact male who wants to identify as a woman who wants to walk around the locker room with his dick out yes exactly because there's people that do that just because they get off exactly so you just you just kind of have something which is like a like I said sort of moral invulnerability or like where you can like even questioning them is uh you get attacked you know because obviously bad people will abuse that well that's when I got thrown into this whole thing because there was a fighter who was a biological man who uh became transgender and was competing against women without telling them that they were a biological man they said they didn't have to tell people because it was a medical condition like no yeah that's not what it is it's not what it is like you can't say that and and and of all sports like if someone scores more points in basketball well that's unfair but if someone beats the out of someone because they're lying about being a biological male that's crazy you're literally allowing someone to get brain damage because you want to appeal to the the woke crazy people that think it's all right yeah it's so strange that that when that's sort of the thing that red pilled me when I got attacked for that I'm like this is so nuts I can't believe we're at this stage where I'm saying hey I don't think it's cool if you pretend you're a woman and beat the out of women and people are like you're out of line like totally well we're in we're we're in fantasy land now now we're pretending because it it helps you it helps you feel better yeah totally it's just such a strange time and if it wasn't for something like Twitter where this could be discussed want some more that I'll get some more M let's get some more coffee young Jamie um if it wasn't for Twitter you know at the early Twitter you would be kicked off forever if you just dead name someone so like which is insane insane yeah insane I mean especially if if you think about all the things that like the look look the Harris campaign and what the lies they've told about Trump that we discussed earlier uh you can't you don't get kicked off for that but you get kicked off for calling Caitlyn Jenner Bruce Forever For Life yeah it's totally insane yeah and but if it wasn't for you buying that and and changing Twitter I I don't think we would be where we're at right now I think it was it was a pivotal moment I think historically when people look back on it it's going to be a pivotal moment in this very bizarre fight for the Freedom of Information yeah well I mean at the time I said I think like look I think this is um existential to the United States um it's existential to democracy um because if if you don't if you don't have freedom of speech you don't have democracy okay because if people if you don't have freedom of speech people cannot make an informed vote if if if they're just being fed propaganda uh and and there's no freedom of speech democracy is an illusion um so uh freedom of speech is the bed Rock of democracy that's why freedom of speech is the first amendment once you lose freedom of speech you lose democracy game over that's why I bought Twitter and it seems so simple Yes it seems so clear that everyone should agree to that on the left or on the right you shouldn't be given the government if you imagine the Bush Administration during the Iraq War imagine if they had complete total control of of propaganda and of dissent online you don't want that no one wants that no one from the left would want that we shouldn't want it from the left either absolutely and and and there's also like the the media like the Legacy the mainstream media what I call the Legacy Media at this point um it it used to be much more balanced like if you look at sort of um political donations over time Republican versus Democrat um there used to be uh the media was I mean they always had like a left bias but there was like I don't know it was like 2/3 Democrat 1/3 Republican type of thing in in ter in terms of uh journalists giving making political donations now it's like 95% or something a Democrat so the the Legacy Media the mainstream media is is is not balanced at all they're they're just a mouthpiece for the Democrat Democratic party um and you can see that in in how consistent their headlines are like they don't behave like their different organizations they behave like they're they're all one hive mind right um so you know like a week before the the Biden Trump debate um the there every media organization was was saying you know Biden is sh's attack I mean it was like it's like it's like guys shop attack is is not a common toner phrase um and literally every TV station every newspaper was like Shar sh like like like somebody did a compilation of all the uh you know the news anchors going Biden Shar his attack Shar his ATT attack is ATT attack it was absurd um and there obviously a huge lie he is in fact not Sha's attack as the public learned one week later my favorite was Joe Scarboro yeah that yeah was wild yeah listen to me this is the best version of Biden ever the sharpest like what the are you saying and then after the debate he's like what do we got to we got to get get rid of him like this is crazy like what did you just say like a couple weeks ago literally yes exactly well the other thing was they're flat out light when they decid that JD Vance was weird yeah remember that one and then they just weirds everywhere weird weird every oh you don't want a weird guy meanwhile you have Tim wal is your VP you don't think that guy's weird super weird he's weird in every way the way he walks the way he waves his hands yeah he reminds me of the clown Emoji he's a bizarre guy he's a strange dude it's a it's I just don't understand why they made that choice yeah it gives the creep I just don't understand why they made that choice there's a lot of other people that are qualified I don't know why in I read that KLA Harris made that decision when she was sleep deprived which is kind of hilarious that she said that so she's kind of admitting she kind of up yeah I mean they obviously should have picked Josh Shapiro at I mean governor of Pennsylvania like that would have been the nobra that's no-brainer move like Pennsylvania's ly lynchpin state do you think it's because he's Jewish because of Shapiro that like the anti- Palestine people would probably or the anti- Palestinian uh Invasion people I think it was an anti-semitic thing yeah it could be that they thought that that was a liability because there was all these Pro Palestine people right now because of the situation in Israel that completely makes sense that they thought that would be a liability but but I don't know I don't know the reason I'm just guessing but but but it's it seems like a crazy thing to do given that Pennsylvania's lynchman state you know it's like the key to the election why would you not pick the popular governor of Pennsylvania right obviously obviously yeah and other than that there's a bunch of other ones too even Nome there's a bunch of other people that you could have chosen like Nome would have been a fine example of someone you could I mean I don't agree with the guy exactly he's polished politician like he lies about as much as wals does but he doesn't lie about the he doesn't say he was a head coach when he was assistant coach doesn't say he was in tennman square I mean that's a liability all those different things lying about his military rank well and whilst like you know Cut and Run when when you know when he was actually called to duty well he knew they were going to be deployed months in advance so he resigned and he also took uh so this is where he was dishonest about his rank yeah CLA he was like s or something like that because that was like what he was going to get if he stay but then he resigned because he knew that he was going to get deployed allegedly I mean that seems like like a cowardly action well whatever it is it's dishonest I mean just to say look just saying that you were a head coach when you're an assistant coach is crazy that's a lie don't do that you should never do that yeah saying he was in tin square or whatever or in Hong Kong whatever like like yo that's one of the most biggest moments in history like it's not like you forgot what you had for lunch last week you know right and not only that but you don't think people are going to research that yeah totally I mean and the the response during the debate was bananas said I'm a knucklehead Yeah well yeah we don't want a knucklehead for a VP okay yeah this is like sometimes I'm a knucklehead like what are you saying are you saying you lied like what did you I I mean this is where you need a podcast and not a debate exactly where you go okay when did you first that you were in t square like did someone say it and you didn't refute it and you got stuck with it like what was cuz this is the thing about like carrying weapons of war like what I carried when I like and like you didn't deploy in war yeah like you can't say that but you kind of let people say that you deployed and then you kind of didn't you know you were deployed in war so did you lie or did someone else lie and you didn't correct them like this is the kind of conversation that you would want to have with a guy podcast and the debates were so skewed where they were correcting like particularly the Biden one where they're correcting Trump over and over again and then correcting Trump with uh comma where kamla was saying things were not true I mean KLA repeated deliberately repeated the fine people hoax and was not fact checked well not only that she also said that no troops were being deployed in a war zone which is I mean I I know troops in war zones I'm like um that's and as vice president you're privy you know you're like you you know you know the official troops and The Unofficial troops right you know so what she said was a like flat out boldface lie flat Next Level boldface lie have you seen the video absurd lie of the troops that were watching it take place and what the are we they're watching it in real time video we're here being shot at so crazy crazy but it just shows you the level of propaganda that we're being subject to which is why people think Donald Trump is the devil cuz the machine has gone all out as far as it can go with laware with propaganda with lies with just pushing as much in this direction as humanly possible connecting it to the Nazi rally like every step of the way no wonder why boomers are like rabid like you got to keep this Nazi out of office he's a fascist exactly if if all you if all you get is like if if you're entire exposure is to Legacy mainstream media um so that all your information sources are that Trump is basically Hitler um then and you have no and your friend group is has that same information you have no counterveiling opinion right so then then they they actually just think like Trump is is Hitler even though it's it's like a little strange he didn't do Hitler things the last four years yeah you know I'm like if he's Hitler why didn't he do Hitler things when he was president for four years right like the reason you know we we we hate hitas because of he started wars in the genocide not because he was a snappy dresser you know um you know and and I'm like uh so tell me about the wars and genocide that Trump did uh I don't remember that and he was President for four years so it's insane it makes no sense well and also he's campaigning on stopping all the wars it's like his primary concern exactly the warmongers like Liz Cheney hate him yeah cuz they love war well they profit off of it they profit off of War yeah yes which is insane insane yeah and that this is happening right in front of everybody's face yeah the the war propers hate Trump yeah which is up I mean mean it's like like like we should be like yeah we let's vote for the guy that the world propers hate that sounds like a great idea it was the wildest thing when Dick Cheney endorsed KLA and the left went crazy like Yay Dick Cheney's on our side like yeah like I'm like can we can we play all the all the videos where you said Dick Cheney was the devil it's the craziest turn the craziest like 180 I've ever seen in my life cuz there's no reason for it yeah doesn't make any sense make sense no logic to it at all just all the sudden he's the devil yeah or he's not The Devil he's he's good it's good that he's supporting Kama even Dick Cheney you know I mean warmongers want want the the kamla puppet regime because they will get more war it's so strange watching all these Hollywood celebrities like step up like and they think it's going to get them more movies or something that's what it is if you know those people people so many of them are compl narcissists well let me tell you how it actually works there is what happens is you know these celebrities they they get a call okay they had a call from someone powerful in Hollywood and uh that person says uh you know it would be really great if you endorsed uh kamla you don't have to it's up to you but if you don't they don't say it they don't say it but if you don't you're never going to get a call again no more movies no more concerts but they they ask they'll ask it they asking really nice way it'd be really nice if you endorse K this is important and so they don't say that if you don't they don't make the threat they don't need to but everyone knows what'll happen if you don't well I think there's also even if they don't think that something's going to happen to them if they don't there's this compelling feeling to support this cause that you think is going to get you a bunch of positive attention and you're going to be on the right side of history and all these narratives that you especially from the left in Hollywood like they're all in on whoever the is the Democrat always 100% there's never a call from the the the Hollywood Machine to support any Republicans I've never seen it once yeah ever never so it's like you realize that and that whole business is based on getting picked it's the whole business is not necessarily Merit based there's a lot of brilliant actors you never hear from there's a lot of people who can do that but they don't get chosen for roles and everybody knows this that you have to sort of socialize the line or you don't get chosen for the roles cuz there's a lot of competition for the rols this why that's why I say like when you when someone powerful in Hollywood who's able to make to choose these roles calls one of these celebrities they know the deal yeah there's no no no threat is necessary well you could see it in real time like with Dennis Quaid when he made that Reagan movie and they wouldn't let him advertise on social media platforms they were they were Banning ads for it yeah for what because it was an election year like what are you talking about this about a guy who's dead yes guy who was president a long ass time ago like what what do you how is this how does this have anything to do with the election year y but it's the punishment it's like you stepped outside the line you supported the other guy yeah you the problem is you'll just you'll just never you'll just never get a call G for a movie or you know concert or whatever it is yeah which is crazy that's the issue I mean we used to allow people to be a Republican and still be a movie star like Clint Eastwood Reagan yeah but Clint yeah like during the Obama Administration Clint Eastwood was like an outspoken Republican and yet was you know a giant movie star and people's like ah it's Clint he was allowed you were allowed to have there was a variety of different opin charlon hon there was a variety of different opinions you were allowed to have but now you're not now it's just like and once Trump trump got into office he became this focal point where the all logic was thrown out the window and it's just Trump is bad you have to attack Trump trump is right right wi's bad everyone rightwing is bad Christian's bad yes it's just strange yeah exactly so well I'll say it again man um I think this is the last election if if Trump doesn't win this is the last election I think you're right yeah I think you're right I think people and a lot of people are waking up and realize that that have been lifelong Democrats guys like Bill Amman like chth Tulsi Garett switched over to the Republicans like there's a lot of people who their whole life they've been leftwing and they realize like I can't do this anymore you and I used to be Democrats yeah so yeah yeah it's nuts it's nuts man and uh you know I mean I think the things we want are just pretty basic you know it's like we want you individual liberties and we want um opportunity W America Remain the land of freedom and opportunity um so we maximize people's personal freedom the govern can't BGE into your house and kill your pet um that's that's up um and uh you know and and and that you succeed as a function of your of your of hard work and talent not anything else not race religion sex doesn't matter you know yes it's basic stuff and and then what did you change the the acronym Dei what did you change it to oh diie what is it die I mean because diversity inclusion and Equity is Di but didn't you change dedication excellence and yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean we we want America opport America being the land of opportunity means that that that we we have an environment where you succeed as a function of your hard workor and skill yeah you know and and that's radical yeah radical the best person makes you rightwing now you know I'm like okay great Co me ring I don't care um so you know like and and and you we we you're not real country unless you have secure borders you're just a fake country um so we we need and our cities are unsafe and and dirty um like um you know my my mom was telling me my mom's like pretty red pulled at this point but but you know what's going to Red Pill you really really fast is is is having a friends get assaulted on the streets of New York yeah and and that happened to three of our friends this year got assaulted on the streets of New York just walking around yeah um and um nobody got arrested nothing nothing happened well the the morale of police is like depleted yeah substantially for sure the morale of the police get depleted and and then also like at some point like like if you're a police officer and you you're arresting someone who's who's violent you're putting a life at risk obviously because they might you know some sometimes they'll try to kill you and then if you know that arresting that's violent person they will be immediately released by The Da which happens in New York Alvin brag doesn't he doesn't prosecute people um then then why why should a police officer put their life at risk to arrest someone when they know they will not be they will just be let out immediately yeah it's pointless yeah then we got it's like the freaking Joker it's like dark KN Dark Knight like the freaking Joker is in charge yeah like the the criminals Run free and the citizens are arrested that like this is why I like keep com back to this this I'm like still pretty shook about the freaking squirrel thing it's like yeah they at at gunpoint forced the guy to like stay outside his house while they got his pets and killed them meanwhile you know violent felons are running free in this is in New York states are running free this this a joker yeah it's not the the LW abiding citizens are are you know arrested and and and the criminals are they free this is this is up guys just the fact that they have the resources to do that when they have all the crime that they have you have the resource the government resources to go kill someone's squirrel yeah what this whole idea of this um government efficiency agency the Govern yeah I mean qu whatever you want but what do you want to call it what do you call it I mean I think the funniest name is is do the the Doge Department of Department of government efficiency um yeah I mean the idea is is pretty simple is that like we've got uh this this uh suffocating massive Federal bureaucracy and we need to uh you it's that is and the government government spending is like bankrupting the country uh you know our uh interest payments on the national debt now exceed the defense department budget which is and the defense budget is like a trillion dollars a year interest payments on our on the national debt are now higher than the defense department budget and and growing like every month so it's like it's not like a like basically we're on a path to to bankruptcy America's on a path to bankruptcy so we have to cut government spending um or we're just going to go bankrupt just like Postwood that overspends um and then but it's even worse than that like we're spending money on all these like these government agencies and I like I asked I actually asked the AI like how many government agencies are there and uh the government isn't even sure how many government agencies there are like so so it's like somewhere around 450 depending on what you call an agency so there there are so there there at the federal level so that that that's almost twice as many a agencies as as years that America has existed so we're creating agencies at roughly two agencies a year wow yes uh so this is insane I bet there's like I I I wonder if there's even one person who could even name all 450 agencies at the federal level I there might be no one um but hardly anyone let's just say I bet I bet most people couldn't even name like a 100 you know so so this is this is this is crazy so we got the suffocating this vast suffocating Federal bureaucracy that just gets bigger every year um and and eventually you get to the point where everything's illegal you can't get anything done so so what can be done like with obviously the president has a lot of power but how much power and what can be done in terms of like eliminating agencies eliminating waste eliminating yeah well I so like if if Congress has created an agency then I often if you look at the law the law is like pretty simple like the agency has like a very simple task but then that agency over time vastly increases its Authority um and starts doing things that were never authorized by Congress um that's happened with pretty much every agency so so yeah you'd have to you'd have to still you know uh keep an agency you'd have to match the law but you can you can tail the agencies to be much smaller and say you got to stick to what Congress authorized instead of all this other stuff you're doing which I think makes sense and so is the other stuff they're doing just essentially bu bureaucracy run a muck or they just create jobs and create things to do and create a meaning for their existence yeah it's like a tumor it's just going to keep growing Jesus Christ and it and it's so I mean for SpaceX Starship was sitting on on the pad the rocket with the giant rocket we could build the rocket faster than they could process the paperwork to approve the launch two so we're sitting there for two months but do you think that they're doing that on purpose to with you I can't I mean maybe a little but I mean that was also not be cool yeah uh but the I mean another way to think of it is like the the amount of the amount of paperwork uh is going to go roughly with the square of the number of agencies involved so because they all have to meet with each other so like let's say in a best case situation if if if you've got like if if there's like if you're dealing with one agency that's one thing but if if you've got to deal with five agencies and the agencies will have to meet with each other now You' got like you know 25 different you know meeting configurations that have to take place uh and it just everything just you you get just hardened of the arteries you just can't make make progress like this is why we can't build build High highspeed rail in America it's basically illegal right so this has been the the argument has always been that we need regulation because we need to protect the environment we need to protect people we need to make sure the rule of laws followed so we need a certain amount of Regulation but overregulation is a giant problem that's a big issue in California it's a huge issue anywhere where bureaucracy has run a run a monck they make it very difficult to get anything done yes I mean what happens is every year there are more rules and regulations created um and in the past what has served as a cleansing function for rules and regulations is war because like like well we're going to lose if we don't kind of clear the decks but we haven't really had an existential threat of of war in the US we've had prosperity for a long time which has resulted in a massive buildup of rules and regulations every year um and to the point where like I said like everything's illegal you know and it's not like any one regulation is the problem it's like it's like glia being tied down by a million little strings it's not like any one string is the problem but you got a million of them so we have we we've got to clear the decks here um and and I'm not saying we shouldn't have Regulators I'm just saying we we we've gone way too far once you think of regulators like uh like referees on a field you know a sports field um you don't want to have no no refs you want to have some number of refs but you you don't want to have way more refs than players right you don't want to be like well you know the running back couldn't couldn't complete the F because there were too many Regulators in the way because the football Field's full of regulators yeah you know like you can't even play the game right that's the issue we got right now well that's a great analogy yeah I can imagine a football field that's filled with refere like the football Field's filled with refs you know you can't even run past them yeah yeah that I've seen criticism of this idea of you um coming up with this department of like firing a bunch of people and what would happen and how would that work but the criticism doesn't make any sense to me because if there is if you measurably if you can prove that there's a lot of wasted time and resources which I think is pretty easy to do and if you could say that this is not the most efficient like the most efficient businesses are generally private businesses or a a company because they kind of have to be in order stay profitable yeah the government doesn't have to be profitable they don't have to be efficient they don't have competition y so if you're making cars and your cars break down they suck and someone makes cars and the cars are better they're going to succeed so this is the free market the government doesn't have this problem when they're they're in charge of certain things that could probably be better served by the public by the private sector yeah absolutely well look I just think we' we've gotten we've got far too many government agencies the the federal bureaucracy has gotten out of hand um and we just need to pair it down to a sensible level um and if it turns out that like there's some regulation or agency that was doing something useful we can put it right back no problem like it's like oh that regulation was important no problem we put it right back right as long as actually know but be able to be able to look at it logically and objectively and you were also floating around the idea of offering a large Severance to the people that you're going to have removed yeah like a couple years or something like that is that what you're saying yeah I mean I'm just these are again just ideas but I mean it's the point is not that people suffer economic hardship the point is just that they they're it's better there are more productive things they can do in the economy and it's and it would be better if they did these other more productive things um and we didn't have this vast pedal bureaucracy so so like so I was like H you know maybe like a couple years of pay would be good um and then they they could take a vacation they could take it take another job and get double pay I mean it's like it's not like a it's not going to sense create create an economic crisis I think it's actually going to be really good I think because uh we can PE you know people can move to where they're making products and services that are more useful to their fellow human beings the problem is if someone has like a 25 30e career of being institutionalized you're essentially like a part of the government system you've sort of programmed your life and your career to be a part of this bureaucratic system and then you're like NOP you have to go out and compete in the free market you're like [Music] Ah that's that's scary to people but you have to be valuable you have to actually be valuable yeah yeah uh I mean let's look at like you know whatever the the Govern pension and stuff they're not going to be you know um in tough I think they'll be in good Financial shape how are you going to have the time to oversee all this well I'm I'm I'm pretty good at uh you improving efficiency I mean um I would say so yeah but still this this seems like a giant undertaking yeah I I'll probably need to beef obscurity um oh yeah yeah yeah for sure um but you know like I said like no one's going to experience like I think economic hardship that's you know they they'll be fine you know and they'll they'll people do find other roles I mean you can look at sort of um you know like when East Germany and and West Germany got back together you know everyone was basically working for the government in East Germany and um and it was really inefficient and that like their economic output was like in East Germany was like I know a quarter of what it was in in West Germany because everyone was working for the government government's like fundamentally inefficient so um the best example is probably North and South Korea right yeah like people are starving North Korea and and South Korea is incredibly prosperous yeah so and it's the same people just different operating system right so um you know it's just like you just want to move people from you know less productive things to more productive things um where they may you because you can also say like in the limit like let's just say let's consider the other direction where we moved a whole bunch of people that were in the private sector doing making goods and services and we moved them into the government as Regulators now they stopped making those goods and services the so the stuff they were making is no longer available now they're just being Regulators like is that a good thing that's not a good thing doesn't sound good no it's not good doesn't sound like there's a real market for it like you're creating jobs that don't necessarily need to be there they're all these fake jobs basically um and um that doesn't make sense so look we we got to do this because the the country's going bankrupt like we if we don't take action we're we're dollars going to be worth nothing and the interest payments which are already 23% of of to of 23% of all govern income call income taxes tariffs and everything is just going to pay interest right now and that number is continually Rising so if we don't do something the entire government budget will be paying interest there won't be money for anything no it won't be money for Social Security won't be money for Medicare nothing that's where we're headed that's what bankruptcy means yeah that's such an insane concept yes um let like hello wake up wake up and if somebody can tell me can can can show me like pencil out the math show me how this works I'd love to hear it but but just like listen I'm looking at the numbers here and I'm like if we're don't to do something America's toast won't be money for anything Trump likes to talk a lot about a lot is tariffs yeah what what are your thoughts on tariffs I know that's very controversial to even people economists they disagree some agree some think it's a good idea some think it's a terrible idea what do you think I think you need to be careful with tariffs um like the I I deal a lot a lot with like supply chain issues you know like like the global automotive supply chain for Tesla for example is incredibly complex so when there are sudden changes in tariffs then you're like well you we've got a factory like somewhere else that's making a part that goes into the car now that suddenly if that part's suddenly twice as expensive it like messes everything up you know so um so you you want to be uh have tariffs be predictable um so that companies can adjust their supply chain I mean I think I think companies are more than happy to uh increase uh Manufacturing in America it's just that you can't do it instantly so if if you if you put in if you if you put put up giant tariffs immediately um and don't give companies a chance to uh you know build factories in America like because you have to you got to move atoms like you've got to build a building you've got to install equipment you've got to train people like that doesn't happen instantly um so you just got you want to have a for tariffs uh you want to have a ramp so that people companies can adjust um and and and build the factories and train the people and get the equipment in place um otherwise just you basically just shock the system and it and and it breaks or bad things happen so I'm I'm against like sudden sudden giant tariffs because they they're it's an impossible response if you've got to you know move a thousand tons of equipment you know you just some cases collectively millions of tons of equipment you just can't do that overnight it's literally impossible so I think we want to be thoughtful about tariffs um and and give companies a ramp I mean I do generally agree that America should do more manufacturing I'm a big manufacturing guy I love manufacturing so I've spent a lot of time in the factory well we've talked openly about the difficulties of manufacturing and how complicated it is and about most people aren't really aware of something that's as complex as like say building a Tesla yeah Manu is super hard and complicated so you know like a lot of people just they they've never been in a factory or they don't know where how how difficult it is to make things um and they you know for a lot of people they think just ketchup comes from the store you know like the store like just has a like those are like people like for a lot of people who've been in Academia or you know for all these like sort of Socialist Communist types like they've never actually made anything so they they they they're opera on the premise that there's this magical Horn of planty that just outputs goods and services and if someone's got more goods and services than someone else's cuz they took more from this magical Horn of Plenty and I'm like guys there's no magical Horn of Plenty the the there's there's no Cornucopia uh it's actually goods and services come from people working collectively doing a lot of hard work to produce the goods and services that you like um and that you that you need um so but we've become very accustomed these things happening overseas I mean America is still the second biggest manufacturer in the world so it's not not mean still make a lot of stuff but um we could make more um probably should make more I think we should value manufacturing a lot more in the United States than we currently do well it' be very nice if we were completely self-sufficient like medicine like there's a bunch of different things that get manufactured overseas that was a huge problem during covid because all the shipping was shut down yeah I mean you you don't want to say like so there there's a lot of Merit to the economics of comparative advantage like like so if you complete self-sufficient what that means is that you make all the stuff yourself and and and and even if some other country is really good at making something you still make it yourself and which means you're going to have the inferior more costly product domestically right um like Soviet Russia yeah um like trade trade improves Prosperity this is this is important um so you you don't actually want to be make everything yourself um and you can you can run this like you can think of this thought experiment on a on a sort of a a m a micro scale and or small scale and then expand that and say where does the at at what point does the th experiment no longer prove to be valid now let's let's let's cons consider the case of you as an individual imagine you have to do everything yourself you had to farm you had to uh grow chickens you got if you want eggs you've got to build your own house you've got to do your own uh electrical repair your own Plumbing everything yourself everything how now that would be impossible okay now let's expand it to okay you've got there's 10 people now you're going to have some some uh specialization of tasks okay maybe one person can be really good at you know uh construction another person could be good at farming it's like but it's still you know 10 people's not enough so like let's go to 100 people now let's go to 100 million people now let's go to a billion people and you still get the the economics of of uh specialization like like specialization of Labor where people become expert at particular things still matters at a billion people or at 8 billion people which is Earth so you still want um you you do want specialization of Labor you do want uh countries to be really good at a particular thing and make that thing um also it encourages Innovation if you have competition if the Germans are making better cars we have to make better cars we have to compete with them which is like one of the things that happen during like the 80s and 90s and America was making crap cars and Germany was making much better ones yeah exactly I mean the yeah the Japanese car I mean yeah I mean basically American car industry got really lazy in the 70s uh and and80s and and then the Japanese and German car companies came in and just cleaned the clock you know um and uh there was like a an old joke from the that that is kind of telling um it's a very old joke um where it's like why did the Japanese car companies beat the American car companies um well it's like well the in the Japanese car company you had eight people rowing and one person steering and in the American Car Company you had eight people steering and one person rowing if this was a boat so imagine the boat race yeah boat race Japanese boat you got eight people rowing one person steering in the American boat um you got you got one person rowing and eight people steering and when the American Car Company loses the race they they fire the rower and it's like okay that was actually kind of true yeah one of things like everyone wants to do the be the boss andone everybody wants to do the work type of thing yeah um one thing that a lot of people are concerned about is uh the potential disruption that's going to come about with Automation and AI that a lot of these jobs manufacturing jobs uh Teamsters all that stuff is going to be eliminated what what do I mean you're at the Forefront of this so how do you see this playing out and what do you think that can be done to mitigate uh a lot of the loss of purpose that a lot of people are going to feel loss of income obviously Universal basic income is being floated about but that seems to me to only be part of the problem the another big part of the problem is people losing a sense of purpose yeah now we're talking about something which is still pretty far in the future you know like um how far do you think it is well I mean it's it's probably I don't know 15 20 years years of a thing um so we've got like immediate issues we've got short-term issues that are I know 1 to three years medium-term issues like 5 to 10 years longer term issues which are like maybe 20 years um longer term I think there is this question if if you have ai and Robotics how do you find meaning in life if the computer can do everything better than you can and the robot can do everything better than you can but we're we're still we got a long way to go before that and we're you know um and I do think it's like 80% likely to be a good outcome like maybe 90 um so I think everyone's going to have their own like personal robot like and and I think at a certain point like wouldn't you want to have your own personal c3p R2-D2 so it's going to be essentially just like everyone has their own phone yeah everyone will have their own robot buddy like literally well it would be great if it protected you like if you walked down the street of New York City have a Terminator with you uh I know about the Terminator hopefully we got to avoid we don't want this to be the plot of James James Cameron you know we would more more more Gene rotenberry than than James Cameron uh movie situation but it would be fascinating to watch some rich person walk down the street of New York City flanked by two giant Tesla robots Jack Tesla robots were there protect something that just fully robots so many fully robot there to protect you from a bad neighborhood yeah that would be very interesting I mean this is you could potentially see that yeah um restaurants would probably have no robot rules they can't bring a robot yeah leave your robot stand leave your robot outside your robot standing by the table man the future's going to be wild it's going to be wild yeah yeah it's going to be really unpredictable like uh I don't think I mean you probably have a pretty good sense of it but I think most people don't understand the wave that's coming yeah and I was kind of kind of completely drown society and change it forever yeah I mean it's we we have like I said it's it's not like it's not going to happen like overnight but it's 20 years from now I'm like I think it's like 20 years from now I think there's going to be more more humanoid robots than are humans really yes more humanized what that's so crazy like so that's like more guns we have more guns than people in America we have more robots than people in America as well yes you have a bunch of old robots nobody wants anymore I guess um early early pions or something um in in a historical timeline 20 years in the past is not been that big of a deal you know I mean this a big deal but you go from like 1900 1920 not that big of a deal 1920 1940 kind of a big deal 1940 1960 things start getting weird 60 to 80 wow that's a big difference 80 to 2000 holy now you have the internet 2000 to 2020 whoa this is nuts you have propaganda social media YouTube streaming 20 years from now like what are we even talking about M it's going to be that much of a shift like it's all accelerating and we're in the middle of it so it's very difficult to sort of like feel it while it's happening it kind of just feels like life and you just get adapted to the changes yeah I mean people's phones at this point are a supercomputer in their pocket like an article that can answer any questions people just take it for granted yeah it's normal yeah they get mad if it doesn't work yeah it's like Louis CK's joke about using your phone when you're on a plane piece of like you're in the sky floating in the air and now it will work with starlink too what's that it will work with starlink the starlink the starlink connection uh it'll be like being on the ground well I was telling you how I used starlink when I was in Utah I was in the mountains of Utah there was no cell phone service anywhere near and we had full YouTube we had text messages FaceTime everything phone calls it was nuts yeah and it was it's this big as that cigar box yeah it's crazy it's so light when I brought it out there like that's it I this is it let just plug it in and the guys I was in Camp with they like this is crazy yeah the whole Camp was like sharing it so like 10 people yeah using the the Wi-Fi signal right it's nuts yep and then you know that's the beginning I mean you what you're at right now is like what version this is starlink mini right so this is like a very small version how how much smaller can it scale down from that well there's a certain uh area that you need like the bigger the area the it's the more you can like like bandwidth yeah because you're you're like trying to catch these like photons essentially so you can think of the like the you know the area of the of of the of the antenna is like the more area you have the more photons you can catch um so but but we have a direct to sell capability as well that we're just uh We've we've been launching that will turn on I probably in a few months um that that'll actually connect directly to a cell phone unmodified U but but because the cell phone is a much worse antenna than a dedicated antenna it'll be about a 100 times less bandwidth but still you know you'll be able to like do text messages you know pictures like medium resolution videos that kind of thing one of the cool things about the new phone the new uh iPhone the iPhone 16 uh I got it and I was in the mountains last month and I was text messaging with satellites yeah iMessages right and receiving them but just text yeah just text yeah but still pretty impressive yeah yeah I mean what are we what are we going to be looking at 100 years from now I mean when you 100 years from now I hope civilization's around yeah that'll be a win yeah yeah what what are the chances that we this whole thing up 50% it's hard to say I mean um I guess not like I don't think civilization will be totally destroyed unless there's like some really massive Global th nuclear war um but uh I mean you Stephen Hawking he would say that there's like a one at least a 1% chance of total Annihilation every Century that was his rough estimate um but there's a much bigger chance of civilization being less capable than it is today so you say like well because you look at say you know these various civilizations throughout history um whether it's the like ancient samarians or the you know Egyptians the Romans like they they there's like a life cycle to civilization they reached a peak and then they started subsiding um so so I think a bigger question is like will will will our technology level be better or worse than it is today in 100 years um I think it's probably going to be better I I think but any estimates are are going to be so there's so many dependencies like like an estimate I think is I'm not sure it has any any meaning um because it's like there's so many things that can happen in 100 years well The Logical hope is always that people pay attention to history and they recognize the patterns and how civilizations have collapsed yeah and they recognize what's going wrong in the current society and say we have to do our best to mitigate this and we've seen this happen before let's course correct and let's sort of manage what we've got here now and maintain what we've got here now because it's pretty extraordinary yes this is what we're hoping for with this election this is what we're hoping for with the future is that people can see we are on a bad path and something can be done right now and it might be the only moment in history where this is possible because if they do lock the country down and make it so that voting is kind of you're voting for primaries and the people that they put in the primaries they're controlling that in the first place you don't really have democracy anymore you don't really have Choice exactly you don't really have freedom that's right yeah I think freedom is is fundamentally at stake in the election tomorrow and we'll know we'll know I think we'll know by the end of day tomorrow I don't think it's going to take it's not going to be like days after the election I think we'll know tomorrow are you optimistic I I am I'm currently optimistic but um the the biggest Factor here is that men need to vote that is the biggest issue so um I I don't know what what the reason is but but men just vote at a much lower rate than women I think it's like 9% right someone just told me that today it's it's a it's a big difference um like and uh I'm just like saying this is a message to the men out there vote like your life depends on it because I think it does vote vote tomorrow like your life depends on it nothing is more important I agree yeah listen man thank you for being here I know you're busy as so I really appreciate your time and again I I thank you so much for buying Twitter because I really do believe that you've changed the course of history I I really do think you've you've created a pathway where people can actually Express themselves and actually exchange information that really didn't exist before and I think it was dangerous it is it is dangerous hopefully I live long enough to see my kids grow up and people on Mars that's that be that's that's all I'm asking for here I don't think that's too much to happen thank you very much appreciate thank you pleasure all right bye [Music] [Applause] [Music]"
