      "transcript": "you have become the wealthiest man in the world it was fine being the second wealthiest person in the world that actually worked fine what propelled you to sell things more than books i thought to myself we can sell anything this way who came up with the idea of prime what happens when you offer a free all-you-can-eat buffet who shows up to the buffet first the heavy eaters there are some people who criticize some things that the washington post says i have no idea what you're talking about would you fix your time please well people wouldn't recognize me if my tie was fixed but okay just leave it this way all right [Music] i don't consider myself a journalist and nobody else would consider myself a journalist i began to take on the life of being an interviewer even though i have a day job running a private equity firm how do you define leadership what is it that makes somebody tick your stock is actually up 70 this year um is there one thing that you think is responsible for that or several things because 70 is pretty good now i um it's a i have been lecturing we have all hands meetings at amazon and for 20 years ever since we've been about 21 years now in 1997 every at almost every all hands meeting i said look when the stock is up 30 percent in a month don't feel 30 percent smarter because when the stock is down 30 percent in a month it's not going to feel so good to feel 30 percent dumber and that's what happens uh never spend any time thinking about the daily stock price i don't okay so as a result of going up 70 percent this year you have become the wealthiest man in the world is that a title that you really wanted or not i isn't it i can't assure you i have never sought that title and um it was fine being the second wealthiest person in the world that actually worked fine um it's not it isn't a um it i i would say it's something people naturally are curious about you know it's a kind of an interesting curiosity but it's not the thing i would much rather if they said like um you know inventor jeff bezos or entrepreneur jeff bezos or uh you know father jeff bezos those kinds of things are much more meaningful to me and uh the you know the it's an output measure that if you look at the financial success of amazon and the stock i own 16 of amazon and amazon's worth roughly a trillion dollars that means that what we have built over 20 years we have built 840 billion dollars of wealth for other people and that's great that's how it should be you know there i believe so powerfully in uh the ability of entrepreneurial capitalism and free markets to solve so many of the world's problems not all of them but so many of them so um you live in washington state near in seattle or outside of seattle now the man who was the richest man for about 20 years is named bill gates yeah and um what is the likelihood that the two richest men in the world live not only in the same country not only the same state not only the same city but in the same neighborhood i mean is there something in that neighborhood that we should know about and are there are there any more houses for sale there that's right after i saw bill uh not not too long ago um i you know we were joking about the world's richest man thing and i i basically said thank you know i said you're welcome and he immediately turned to me and said thank you um but no medina is a great little uh it's a suburb of seattle and you know i don't think there's anything special in the water there and you know i did locate amazon in seattle because of microsoft i thought that that big pool of technical talent would provide a good place to recruit talented people from and that did turn out to be true so it's not a complete coincidence there's some correlation there if you go into a store when you want to buy something do you have to put a credit card down you to say i'm jeff bezos and they send you the stuff how do you do that and you have to care you carry cash around or you carry yeah i think i do carry cash and i have uh i have credit cards yeah and if you're credit i have to show my driver's license and you know but have you ever had a credit card denied does that never happen i i have i've i've had my credit card denied so what are you saying when that you say don't you know who i give him another credit card i stay here try this one okay so um you made an announcement that is uh the most significant philanthropic gift you've made in this type it was a about about a year ago you said you wanted to look for some good philanthropic ideas and you got i think 47 000 of them and you reviewed them and how did you decide uh where to put this two billion dollars and would you describe exactly what you're to well that process was very helpful so i i solicited ideas uh kind of crowd sourced and i got literally as you said something like 47 000 maybe even a little more some of them came to my inbox most of them came on social media and i read through thousands and thousands of them my uh office kind of correlated them all and put them into buckets and there were some themes that emerged but the other thing that's fascinating about the kind of exercises you see just how long-tailed it is people are interested in trying to help the world in so many different ways a lot of people are very interested in homelessness including me a lot of people are very interested in education of all kinds i'm very interested in early education and i may you know the apple doesn't fall far from the tree my mother has become in running the bezos family foundation she has become an expert in in early education i'm a student of montessori schools i started at montessori when i was two years old and uh the the teacher complained to my mother the montessori school teacher complained my mother that i was too task focused and that she she couldn't get me to switch tasks so she would have to just pick up my chair and move me and by the way i think that's if you ask the people who work with me that's still probably true did that teacher ever call you since and said she was responsible for your success no i'm in touch with several of my um high school elementary school teachers though but i don't know any of my montessori school teachers okay so the gift that you're giving essentially you're going to have some for preschool for children who need preschool free treat full tuition preschool montessori inspired um i'm very excited about that because um i'm going to operate that that's going to be an operating non-profit and we're going to put them in low-income neighborhoods we know for a fact that if a kid falls behind it's really really hard to catch up and if you can give somebody a leg up when they're two three or four years old by the time they get to kindergarten or first grade they're much less likely to fall behind it can still happen but you've really improved their odds the money spent there is going to pay gigantic dividends for decades the other part of your gift will be to give awards out to yes and that's going to be more traditional grant making philanthropy so there i'm going to identify with the help of a team identify and fund vet and fund family homeless shelters and that will be you you said you would give an initial two billion dollars expect to add to that yeah it's day one everything i've ever done has started small amazon started with a couple of people and um uh blue origin started with five people and the budget at blue origin was very very small now the budget of blue origins approaches a billion dollars a year and next year it'll be more than a billion dollars in amazon it literally was 10 people today it's half a million people but you it's hard to remember for you guys but for me it's like yesterday i was driving the packages to the post office myself and hoping one day we could afford a forklift and so but so for me i've seen small things get big and it's part of this day one mentality i like treating things as if if they're small you know amazon even though it is a large company i wanted to have the heart and spirit of a small one and uh and so anyway that the day one foundation is going to be like that we'll we'll we'll um will wander a little bit too so i we have some very specific ideas what we want to do but i believe in the power of wandering all of my best decisions in business and in life have been made with heart intuition guts you know not not uh an analysis when you can make a decision with analysis you should do so but it turns out in life that your most important decisions are always made with instinct intuition taste heart and that's what we'll do with this day one foundation too and the customer is going to be the child this is this is so important because the secret sauce of amazon where there are several principles at amazon but the number one thing that has made us successful by far is obsessive compulsive focus on the customer as opposed to obsession over the competitor and i talk so often to other ceos and some other cos and also founders and entrepreneurs and i can tell that even though they're talking about customers they're really focusing on competitors and it is a huge advantage to any company if you can stay focused on your customer instead of your competitor so then you have to identify who is your customer um so at the washington post for example is the customer the people who buy advertisements from us no the customer is the reader and in the school who are the customers is it the parents is it the teachers no it is the child and that's what we're going to do we're going to be obsessively compulsively focused on the child we're going to be scientific when we can be and we're going to use heart and intuition when we when we want to when you use your intuition make decisions where is the intuition leading you now on your second headquarters all right can can we just take a moment to acknowledge that that may be the best segue in the history of interviewing seriously david that is that is all right that's amazing the answer is uh the answer is very simple we uh we will announce the decision before the end of this year so we've made tremendous progress uh the team is working their butts off on it and we will get there no no hey be nice come on it's really dangerous to demonize the media it's dangerous to call the media lowlifes it's dangerous to say that they're the enemy of the people and every time you attack that you're eroding a little bit around the edges why did you buy the washington post you had no background in that area what convinced you to do that okay first of all i was not looking for a newspaper i had no intention of buying newspaper i had never thought about the idea had never occurred to me it was never something wasn't like a childhood dream nothing and my friend don graham who at that time i had known 15 years i know him 20 years now he approached me through an intermediary and wanted to know if i would be interested in buying the washington post and i sent back word that i would not because i didn't really know anything about newspapers and don over a series of conversations convinced me that um i that was unimportant because we had inside the washington post we have so much talent that understands newspapers that wasn't what the problem was what they needed was somebody who had an understanding of the internet and so so that was the first thing that's kind of how it got started and then i so i did some soul searching and again my decision making process something like this would definitely be intuition and not analysis the the financial situation of the washington post at that time this is 2013 was very upside down the problem was a secular one the internet was just eroding all of the traditional advantages that local newspapers had all of them and i said um you know is this something i want to get involved in if i'm going to do it i'm going to put some heart into it and some work into it and i decided i would only do that if i really believed it was an important institution and i said to myself if this were a financially upside down salty snack food company the answer would be no as soon as i started thinking about it that way i was like this is an important institution it is the newspaper in the capital city of the most important country in the world the washington post has an incredibly important role to play in this democracy there's just no doubt in my mind about that so and and so as soon as i had passed through that gate i only had one more gate that i had to go through before telling dawn yes and that was i wanted to look myself you know be really open with myself and look in the mirror and sort of think about the company and be sure that i was optimistic that it could work because um you know if it were hopeless that would also be not something i would get involved in and i looked at that and i was super optimistic and it needed to be transitioned to a national and a global publication there's one gift that the internet brings newspapers and that is free global distribution so we had to take advantage of that gift and that's that was the basic strategy we had to switch from a business model where we made a lot of money per reader with a relatively small number of readers to a little bit tiny bit of money per reader on a very large number of readers and that's the transition that we did last night i'm pleased to report to you that the post is profitable today um the newsroom is growing it's been growing every year since i've been there it's working and i'm so proud of that team and i know for a fact when i'm 80 or let's say i always project myself forward to age 80 but as i get older i'm starting to do 90. so i know that when i'm 90 it's gonna be one of the things i'm most proud of is that i took on the washington post and helped them through a very rough transition so um when you when you agreed to buy it um i think the the asking price was 250 million dollars you'd negotiate no hit done i asked him how much he wanted he said 250 i said fine i didn't negotiate with him and i did no due diligence and he i wouldn't need to with don he have something i'd like to sell [Laughter] now that you own the washington post sometimes there are some people who criticize some things that the washington post says and you've been remarkably quiet i have no idea what you're talking about well you've been remarkably quiet in not defending uh yourself well i do defend the post it is a mistake for any elected official in my opinion i don't think this is a very uh out their opinion to attack media and journalists i believe that it is an essential component of our democracy there has never been i was going to say never been elected official who liked their headlines i think there's probably no no public figure who has ever liked their headlines it's okay it's part of the process you know it's it's um if you're the president of the united states or a governor of a state or whatever you you don't take that job thinking you're not gonna get scrutinized you're gonna get scrutinized and it's it's it's healthy and um somebody very you know what what what um what the president should say is this is right this is good i'm glad i'm being scrutinized and that would be so secure and confident but it's really dangerous to demonize the media it's dangerous to call the media lowlifes it's dangerous to say that they're the enemy of the people we live in a society where it's not just the laws of the land that protect us we do have freedom of press it's in the constitution we but what we but it's also the social norms that protect us those we it works because we believe those words on that piece of paper and every time you attack that you're eroding a little bit around the edges now look i don't want to be dramatic here we are so robust in this country the media is going to be fine let's talk about how you came to the situation where you are today so you grew up um in texas initially yes and from early age were you a pretty smart student and your teachers tell you this you know you were good i have always been academically smart and um that you know by the way the older i get i realize how many kinds of smart there are there are a lot of kinds of smart they're a lot of kinds of stupid too but but there are uh you know i see people all the time who i know they wouldn't have gotten a pluses on you know their calculus exams but they're incredibly smart but yes i was a very good student right so you ultimately moved to high school in miami and then you were validatory in every class and then you gave a speech as the valedictorian saying you thought we should colonize space or something like that i did it it was 1982 i graduated from high school in 1982. big public high school miami palmetto senior high go panthers and there were 750 kids in my graduating class and i loved high school i had so much fun we had i lost my library privileges because i laughed too loudly in the library and what about that laugh where did you get that laugh from you know it is distinctive i've had that laugh all my life there was a short not that short there was a multi-year period where my brother and sister would not see a movie with me because they thought it was too embarrassing and my uh but i don't know why i have this laugh it's just it's just and i laugh easily and often the people who know me you know ask my mom or anybody who knows me well and they'll say if jeff's unhappy wait five minutes i was packing boxes on my hands and knees and um with somebody else and standing next to me kneeling next to me we're packing and i said you know what we need knee pads this is killing my knees and this guy packing alongside me said we need packing tables and i was like that's the most brilliant idea i've ever heard you graduated as validatory and you decided to go to princeton how come you decide to go to princeton because i wanted to be a theoretical physicist i changed my uh major very quickly to electrical engineering and computers you graduated summa laude i graduated summa laude phi beta kappa phi beta kappa and then you went into the highest calling of mankind finance yes i went i went to new york city and i ended up working at a quantitative hedge fund run by a brilliant man named david shaw d.e shawn co i learned so much from him i used a lot of his ideas and principles on things like hr and recruiting and what kind of people to hire when i started very very good well-known hedge fund and you were a star there as i understand what propelled you to say i'm quitting this i'm going to start a company selling books over the internet i'm going to do it from seattle where'd that idea come from i came across the fact um so this is 1994. nobody has heard of the internet very very few people and i came across the fact that the web world wide web was growing at something like 2 300 a year this is in 1994 and anything growing that fast is even if it's baseline usage today is tiny it's growing so fast it's gonna be big and so i looked at that and i was like there's got to be i should come up with a business idea and to get you know on the internet and then let the internet go around this and we can keep working on it and so i made a list of products that i might saw online i started force ranking them and i picked books because books is super unusual in one respect which is that they're more book items in the book category than there are items in the other category there are three million different books active and in print around the world at any given time so my my the founding idea of amazon was to build universal selection of books the biggest bookstores only had 150 000 titles and so that's what i did and and i you know i hired a small team we built we built the software i moved to seattle i mean you told your parents you're going to quit the esha where you're successful making presumably a fair amount of money yeah and you told your wife mackenzie that you're going to move across the country what did they all say they were immediately and reflexively supportive right after they ask the question what's the internet right and so no that but this is right you know um you know you on you with your loved ones you you you bet on them you're not betting on the idea you're you're you are betting on the person and that was uh that and it's one of those decisions i made with my heart and not my head and i basically said i don't want to regret i don't when i'm 80 now 90 i have i want to have minimized the number of regrets that i have in my life and most of our regrets are acts of omission they're things we didn't try it's the path untraveled um those are the things that haunt us and you were telling me that you had to go deliver the books yeah to the post office yourself i still i don't still delivered but i was doing that for years and i and i was packing boxes on my hands and knees in the first month i was packing boxes on my hands and knees on the hard cement floors and um with somebody else and standing next to me kneeling next to me we're packing and and i said you know what we need knee pads this is killing my niece and this guy packing alongside me said we need packing tables and i was like that's the most brilliant idea i've ever heard and the next day i went and bought packing tables and it like doubled our productivity think about it as a senior executive what do you really get paid to do you get paid to make a small number of high quality decisions what propelled you to sell things more than books after books we started selling music and then we started selling videos and then i got smart and i um i emailed a thousand randomly selected customers and asked them besides the things we saw today what would you like to see us sell and that answer came back incredibly long tailed the way they answered the question was with whatever they were looking for at that moment so like i remember one of the answers was i wish you sold windshield wiper blades because i really need windshield wiper blades and i thought to myself we can sell anything this way and and then so then we launched electronics and toys and many other categories over time and the division became because you read the original business plan it's just books your stock at one point i think went to 100 but then it went down to six or something like that at the peak of the internet bubble our stock peaked somewhere around 113 dollars and then after the internet bubble you know busted open our stock went down to six it went from 113 to six in less than a year so my annual shareholder that year starts with a one word sentence and that one word sentence is the word ouch so most of those internet companies of the dot com era are out of business yeah you survived what was that that made you to survive and virtually the rest of them are gone um i it's very that whole period is very interesting because the stock is not the company and the company is not the stock and so as i watch the stock fall from 113 to 6 i was also watching all of our internal business metrics number of customers profit per unit you know everything you can imagine defects et every single thing about the business was getting better and fast and so as the stock price was going the wrong way everything inside the company was going the right way and um uh i you know so i wasn't we didn't need to go back to capital markets we didn't need more money the only reason you know a financial uh bus like the internet bubble bursting is it makes it really hard to raise money but you know we already had the money we needed so we just needed to continue to progress wall street kept saying well amazon's not making any money they're just getting customers where's the profits where are the profits and wall street kept beating you up on that and your response was i don't really care what you think amazon was uh uh you know people always accused us of selling dollar bills for 90 cents and said look anybody can do that and grow revenues that's not what we're doing we always had positive gross margins it's a fixed cost business and so what i could see is that from the internal metrics is that what at a certain volume level um that we would cover our fixed costs and the company would be profitable so who came up with the idea of prime prime seems to be a great way to get money in advance of people actually getting the services yeah whose idea actually it's very interesting so like many inventions inside of a team and i love team inventing is my favorite thing so i tap dance into the office i love amazon i have so much fun there i love blue origin i love the washington post but amazon is my full-time job and i get to invent i get to live two to three years in the future and most of the invention we do there is you know if somebody has an idea and then other people improve the idea and other people come up with objections why it can never work and then we solve those objections and it's a very it's a very fun process we're always wondering what could a loyalty program be and then actually kind of a junior software engineer came up with this idea not as a loyalty program but this idea that we could offer people kind of an all-you-can-eat buffet of fast free shipping and when we modeled that so then you know the finance team went and modeled that idea and the results were horrifying that we would offer unlimited shipping shipping is expensive um and that we would and customers love free shipping but we could see i mean again back to that you have to use heart and intuition there has to be risk taking you have to have instinct all the good decisions have to be made that way you do it with a group you do it with great humility because by the way getting it wrong isn't that bad that's the other thing when when when we make mistakes and we've made doozies like the fire phone and many other things that just didn't work out i can i could we don't have enough time for me to list all of our failed experiments but the big winners pay for thousands of failed experiments so you try something like prime and it was very expensive at the beginning it cost us a lot of money because what happens when you offer a free all-you-can-eat buffet who shows up to the buffet first the heavy eaters it's scary it's like oh my god did i really say as many prawns as you can eat and um and so that is what happened but but surely we could see the trend lines we could see that you know the diff all kinds of customers were coming and they appreciated that service you uh sit around with your team and so forth but you don't like meetings before 10 a.m no you like to get eight hours of sleep and you don't like powerpoints explain all that why is that okay many so i i like to putter in the morning i get up early i go to bed early i get up early i like to putter in the mornings i like to read the newspaper i like to have coffee i like to have breakfast with my kids before they go to school so i have my kind of puttering time is very important to me and so that's why i set my first meeting for 10 o'clock i like to do my high iq meetings before lunch like anything that's going to be really mentally challenging that's a 10 o'clock meeting and because by 5 p.m i'm like i can't think about that today let's try this again tomorrow at 10 a.m and and so then on sleep i get eight hours of sleep i prioritize it unless i'm traveling in different time zones sometimes it's impossible but i am very um focused on it and and and for me i need adults to sleep i think better i have more energy my mood is better all these things and think about it as a senior executive what do you really get paid to do as a senior executive you get paid to make a small number of high quality decisions your job is not to make thousands of decisions every day is that really worth it if the quality of the decisions might be lower because you're tired or grouchy or any number of things now it's different if it's a startup company i mean you know you're really you know when amazon was 100 people that's a different story but but amazon's not a startup company and all of our senior executives operate the same way i do they work in the future they live in the future none of the people who report to me should really be focused on the current quarter i always tell people sometimes i get you know we'll have a good um quarterly conference call or something and and wall street will like our quarterly results and i'll get people will stop me and say congratulations on your quarter and i say thank you but what i'm really thinking is that quarter was baked three years ago i right now i'm working on a quarter that's going to reveal itself in 2021 sometime and that's what you need to be doing you need to be out sort of you know two or three years in advance and um if you are and then why do i need to make 100 decisions today if i make like three good decisions a day that's enough and they should just be as high quality as i can make them now one of the other companies you started within your company is amazon web services a business miracle happened this never happens this is like the greatest piece of business luck in the history of business so far as i know we faced no like-minded competition for seven years when you buy over the internet amazon do you ever get the wrong order is anything ever wrong what do you do do you call up and complain or you don't have any problems no i i i i'm a customer of amazon hopefully like all of you in this is there one person full-time service is your account in this room who's not an amazon customer see me right afterwards and i'll um i'll walk you through it it's um i i yeah i get i have problems sometimes um and i and i treat them like the same way i treat a problem that i would get from customer my email address is famous and i keep it and i read it it's jeff at amazon.com i don't see every email that i get anymore because i get too many but i see a lot of them and i use my curiosity to pick out certain emails i'll get one from a customer and there's a defect you know we've done something wrong that's the usually people are writing us not always but usually the writing is because we've screwed up their order somehow and i am uh so i look at this and for some reason something seems a little odd about that one and so i'll ask the team to do a case study and and find real root cause or causes it's usually causes real root causes and then real root fixes so that when you fix it you're not fixing it for that one customer you're fixing it for every customer and that process is um a gigantic part of what we do so i would treat my if i have a failed order or some bad customer experience i would treat it just like that so um you've revolutionized retail as i say but now you're in the bricks and mortar business you bought whole foods that was the theory behind buying something that doesn't sell things over the internet we're very interested in physical stores and we haven't i've been asked for years we ever opened physical stores literally 20 years have been asked the question and i always say yes but only when we have a differentiated differentiated offering something that's not me too because that space physical storage is so well served if we offer a metoo product offering it's not gonna work we're and it's also just we're not very good at that most of the whenever we've tried dabbling in something that's a me too service we tend to get beaten it doesn't work we're our culture is much better at pioneering and inventing and so we have to have something that's different and that's what amazon go is it's completely different the amazon bookstore completely different and we have ideas about how to merge prime and whole foods to make that those are still rolling out you haven't seen them yet but to make to use amazon prime to make whole foods a very differentiated experience and so what we're going to be able to do is take some of our resources some of our technical technological know-how and and expand the whole foods mission they have a great mission which is to bring nourishing food to everybody organic nourishing food to everybody and um but you know we have a lot to bring to that table in terms of resources but also in terms of operational excellence and in terms of technology know-how now one of the other companies you started within your company which is technologically a superior company is amazon web services where did the idea come from aws we started it i don't know a long time ago now 15 years ago and worked on it behind the scenes for a long time and then finally launched it it has become a very large company and it at aws we completely reinvented the way that companies buy computation then a business miracle happened this never happens this is like the greatest piece of business luck in the history of business so far as i know we faced no like-minded competition for seven years it's unbelievable and uh we like i'll give you like uh when i launched amazon.com in 1995 barnes and noble launched barnesandnoble.com in 1997. two years that's very cla that's very typical if you invent something new we launched kendall barnes noble launched nook two years later we launched echo google launched google home two years later when you pioneer if you're lucky you get a two year head start nobody gets a seven year head start and so that was um incredible because um and i think it was a whole confluence of things i think that the big established enterprise software companies did not see amazon as a credible enterprise software company and so we had this long runway to build this incredible feature rich and it's just so far ahead of all the other products and services available to do this work today but do you worry that the us government might come along or the european government some regulatory thing could come and impair your business well not here's here's what i think about that i have i have a couple i get asked this question frequently i thought it was an original question no sorry you do do that sometimes but that's not one of them um and my view on this is very simple all big institutions of any kind are going to be and should be examined scrutinized inspected governments should be inspected government institutions big educational institutions big non-profits big companies they're going to get scrutiny it's not personal it's kind of what we as a society want to have happen so that's that's one thing and i and i remind people internally when you know the if they that don't take this personally that will lead you in a lot of wasted energy this is just normal it's actually healthy it's good and then the second thing i think is we are so inventive that whatever regulations are promulgated or however it works that will not stop us from serving customers so to to really you know i mean under all uh kind of regulatory frameworks that i can imagine um customers are still going to want low prices they're still going to want fast delivery they're still going to want big selection it's really important that that politicians and others not they need to understand the value that big companies bring and not demonize or vilify business in general or especially not business well they shouldn't vilify big companies and they certainly vilify business in general for sure and the reason is simple there are certain things only big companies can do i love you know garage entrepreneurs i invest in a lot of their companies i know many of them but nobody in their garage is going to build an all carbon fiber fuel efficient boeing 787 it's not going to happen you need boeing to do that this world would be really bad without boeing and without apple and without samsung and so on one of your passions is not just amazon but it's outer space and space travel so there's all sorts of problems um that we are about to face because for the first time in our civilizational history going back thousands of years we're now big compared to the size of the planet we can fix that problem we can fix it in exactly one way by having by moving out into the solar [Music] system one of your passions is not just amazon but it's outer space and space travel and blue origin so you've started blue origin a little bit in secret then you've made it public uh you're putting a billion dollars or more of your own personal capital into it every year next year it'll be more for the first time all right and um what are you going to get out of it are we going to have people going to space what is the purpose this is um this this is the most important work i'm doing and i have great conviction about that it is um it's a simple argument this is the best planet we have now sent robotic probes to every planet in this solar system believe me this is the good one my friends who say they want to move to mars i say look do me a favor move to the top of mount everest for a year first because that's a garden paradise compared to mars and so this gem of a planet we're finally as a species big enough to really impact it and so you know for for thousands and thousands of years earth was really big and humanity was really small that's not true anymore and so we face a choice as we move forward we're going to have to decide whether we want a civilization of stasis which we could do that's a real that's a legitimate choice what does it mean it means we will have to cap population we will have to cap energy usage per capita so people don't think about how much energy they use it's it's it takes a lot of energy and uh so do you want that to continue for your grandchildren and your grandchildren's grandchildren in other words i want my grandchildren's grandchildren to be using way more energy per capita than i am and i would like to see not have a population cap i wish there were a trillion humans in the solar system then there would be a thousand einsteins and a thousand mozarts but we don't have that long so there's all sorts of problems that we are about to face because for the first time in our civilizational history going back thousands of years we're now big compared to the size of the planet we can fix that problem but we can fix it in exactly one way by having uh by moving out into the solar system and uh you know and so my part my role in that is i want to build reusable space vehicles that's the heavy lifting amazon was able to get started with only a million dollars in capital um and uh uh and and because i got to ride on the back of the credit card system i got to ride on the back of the pre-existing transportation network that could deliver packages the pre-existing telecommunications network that could allow people to connect to our servers all of that all that would have been hundreds of billions of dollars in capex but the heavy lifting was already in place and that's what allowed facebook if you think about it two kids in a dorm room made this half trillion dollar market cap company in a in you know in an incredibly less than two decades that's unbelievable and so but that can't happen in space there's no way two kids in a dorm room can start a space company of any significance because the price of admission is so high and so i want to build space infrastructure so that the next generations of people can use that infrastructure the same way i used ups and fedex and so on to build amazon and that and and so that's what blue origin is all about so do you ultimately want that to be your legacy or amazon and what would you like to be have as your legacy world's oldest man um that's a that's a famous line i like but my but the the real thing is i you know it'll be whatever it's going to be i'm going to be proud of the things i want i i live my life in such a way that when i in a quiet moment of reflection and i'm thinking back on my life that i have as few regrets as possible and i don't you know what what will my legacy be i have no idea and i i don't even want to spend a lot of time thinking you intend to give away the bulk of your fortune at some point your life i tend to give away uh i don't know how much of it i'm going to give away i'm going to give away a lot of money um in a non-profit model but i'm also going to invest a lot of money and something that any rational investor would say is a really bad investment um which is blue origin but i think it's super important and if i can't make blue origin a for-profit thing maybe i'll convert it to non-profit some at some distant point in the future but that would be i would be i wouldn't want that i want i want it to be a thriving ecosystem more like ups and fedex so let's just close with your wife we haven't mentioned her yet we met in new york city at d.e shanko where we worked we got engaged uh we got we got we dated for three months were engaged for three months and then got married so we our whole kind of dating engagement period was only six months long um it's uh uh i also i i would like to take a moment to talk about my parents if that's okay you didn't ask me but i well i would like to they're they're here in the audience and um my parents are i thank you guys [Applause] you know you get different gifts in life and one of the great gifts i got is my mom and dad it's amazing my highest admiration is withheld for those people we all know some of them i know several of them who had terrible parents maybe they were abusive whatever it is and some of those people who who so admirably break that cycle and pull out and and and make that all work i did not have that situation i was always loved um my parents loved me unconditionally and uh and and by the way it was pretty tough for them you know she doesn't talk about it that much but my mom had me when she was 17 years old she was a high school student in albuquerque new mexico you could ask her but i'm pretty sure that wasn't cool in 1964 to be a pregnant mom in high school in albuquerque new mexico and in fact my grandfather who is another incredibly important figure in my in my life um uh went to bat for her and because the high school wanted to kick her out you weren't allowed to be pregnant in high school there and uh and my grandfather said you can't kick her out it's a public school she gets to go to school and they negotiated for a while and the principal finally said okay she can stay and finish high school but she can't do any extracurricular activities and she can't have a locker and um i know and then and my grandfather being a very wise man he was like done we'll take that deal and so she finished high school she had me and then she married my my dad my dad is my real dad not my biological dad his name is mike he's a cuban immigrant got a scholarship to to college in albuquerque which is where i met my mom so i have a kind of a fairy tale story and my grandfather possibly because i mean i'm pretty sure because my parents were so young starting at age four he would take me every summer on his ranch and it was the most spectacular from age four to sixteen i basically spent every summer working alongside him on the ranch he was the most resourceful man he would um he did all his own veterinary work he would even make his own needles he would pound the wire with the oxy acetylene torch and and drill a little hole in it and sharpen it and make a suture like make a needle that he could suture up the cattle with some of the cattle even survived and um he was a remarkable man in a huge uh part of all of our lives um but it is you don't realize you know you just look back and you know if you if you don't have these parents um you know it's so important so um it's just a really big deal and my grandfather too he was like a second set of parents for me you"

      "transcript": "the wake-up call was finding this startling statistic that web usage in the spring of 1994 was growing at 2300 percent a year you know things just don't grow that fast it's highly unusual and that's up me about thinking what you know what kind of business plan might make sense in the context of that growth I think there are a couple of things and one of the things that everybody should realize and that is probably the single most important factor is that any startup company that turns into a substantial company over the years never lose track of the fact that there was a lot of luck involved in that so you know there are a lot of entrepreneurs there are a lot of people who are very smart very hardworking very few ever have you know the planetary alignment that leads to a tiny little company growing into something substantial so that requires not only a lot of planning a lot of hard work a big team of people who are all dedicated but it also requires that not only the planets align but the you know you get a few galaxies and they're aligning too and that's certainly what happened to us you know our timing was good our our choice of product categories books was a very good choice and we did a lot of analysis on that too to pick that category as the first best category for e-commerce online but there were no guarantees that that was a good category at the time we launched this business it wasn't even crystal clear that the technology would improve fast enough that ordinary people you know non-computer people would even want to bother with this technology so that was good luck so there are a whole bunch of things that have to sort of add a line to make it work I went to my boss and said to him you know I'm gonna go do this crazy thing and I'm gonna start this this company selling books online and this is something that I already been talking to him about in a sort of more general context but then he said let's go on a walk it we went on a two-hour walk in Central Park in New York City and the conclusion of that was this he said you know this actually sounds like a really good idea to me but it sounds like it would be a better idea for somebody who didn't already have a good job and he convinced me to think about it for 48 hours before making a final decision and so I went away and and and was trying to find the right framework in which to make that kind of big decision and you know I already talked to my wife about this and she was very supportive and said look you know you can count me in 100% whatever you want to do no it's true she had married this kind of you know fairly stable guy in a stable career path and now he wanted to go do this crazy thing but she was a hundred percent supportive so it really was a decision that I had to make for myself and the and the framework I found which made the decision incredibly easy was what what I called oats only a nerd would call a regret minimization framework so I wanted to project myself forward to age 80 and say okay now I'm looking back on my life I want to have minimized the number of regrets I have and you know what I knew that when I was 80 I was not going to regret having tried this I was not gonna regret having wanted you know trying to participate in this thing called the Internet that I thought was gonna be a really big deal I knew that if I failed I wouldn't regret that but I knew the one thing I might regret is not ever having tried and I knew that that would haunt me every day and so when I thought about it that way it was an incredibly easy decision and I think that's a very good it's it's if you can project your self out to age 80 and through think what will I think at that time it gets you away from some of the daily pieces of confusion you know I left this Wall Street firm in the middle of the year when you do that you walk away from your annual bonus and that's the kind of thing then the short-term can confuse you but if you think about the long-term then you can really make good life decisions that you won't regret later most regrets by the way are acts of omission and not commission you know I think most people when they're 80 years old you know you can do bad things you can go murder somebody and that would be bad and that would be an act of commission that you would regret but most you know everyday ordinary non murderers they're big regrets are omissions well you know that blank sheet of paper stage is one of the hardest stages and one of the reasons it's hard is because there's at that stage there's nobody counting on you but yourself you know one of the things that is very motivating I mean today it's easy because we've got you know millions of customers counting on us and you know thousands of investors counting on us and then thousands of employee is all counting on each other but in that beginning stage it's really just you and you can quit anytime nobody's gonna care and so you said about doing the simple things first so you want to start a company well the first thing you do is you should write a business plan and so I did that I wrote about a 30 page business plan I wrote a first draft in fact I wrote the first draft on the car trip from you know from from the east coast to the west coast and that was that is very helpful even though the business plan won't survive its first encounters with reality it will always be different the reality will never be the plan but the the discipline of writing the plan forces you to think through some of the issues and to get to her mentally comfortable in the space I mean then you sort of you start to understand you know if you push on this knob this will move over here and so on and so that's the first step tried to get a lot of the little housekeeping details done even before we arrived in Seattle called an attorney actually I called a friend who lived in Seattle asked and he recommend an attorney he said yes he recommended his divorce lawyer but that's who we use do as a general practitioner and as well guy you know a sort of small sole practitioner he incorporated the company asked me on the cell phone what name would you like the accompanying corporate and I said Cadabra as an abracadabra and he said cadaver and I knew then that was not gonna be a good name so we went ahead and incorporated it under that name we changed it about three months later I stopped in San Francisco and the and interviewed vice presidents of engineering because that wasn't going to be an important long lead-time item we needed to build the technology that would run the store and found you know the person who turned out to be the most important person ever in the history of amazon.com on that trip a guy named Schell Cap'n who you know built all of our early systems with with help from others but he really sort of architected that man engineered them and just did a fantastic job so that you know the so the initial hiring right to writing the business plan the initial hiring getting the company incorporated all these are you know they're very in a way they're sort of you know simple almost pedestrian tasks but that's how you start one step at a time the first sort of initial startup capital for amazon.com came primarily from my parents and they invested a large fraction of their life savings in what became amazon.com and you know that is a was a very bold and trusting thing for them to do because they didn't and my dad's first question was what's the internet okay so this he wasn't making a bet on this company or this concept he was making a bet on his son as well as my mother so and and I told them that I thought there was a 70% chance that they would lose their whole investment which was a few hundred thousand dollars and and they did it anyway and and and and you know and I I thought I was giving myself triple the normal odds because you know there's really you know if you look at the odds of a startup company succeeding at all it's only about 10% here I would giving myself a 30% chance startup companies need early planetary alignment because there are so many things that can go wrong and when we launched that store in July of 1995 we were shocked at the customer response you know literally in the first 30 days we had orders from all 50 states and 45 different countries and we were woefully unprepared from an operational point of view to handle that kind of volume and in fact the the the this we quickly expanded we talked to our landlord and we expanded into a 2,000 square foot basement warehouse space it had six foot ceilings one of our 10 employees was 6 - he went around like this the whole time and and we were we were we were doing our day jobs which might have been you know computer programming and all the different things that ten people will do in a little tiny startup company and then we would spend all afternoon and into the wee hours of the morning packing up the orders and shipping them out there you know I would drive these things to UPS and so we get the last one and we wait to the last second I get to UPS and I'd sort of bang on the glass door that was closed and they always would take pity on me and sort of open up and let us you know ship things late we had so many orders that we weren't ready for that we had a we had no real organization in our distribution centers at all in fact we didn't we were packing on our hands and knees on a hard concrete floor and the that I remember just to show you how stupid I can be as you know it my only defense is that it was late but we were packing these things over but everybody in the company and the and I had this brainstorm and as I said to the person next to me this packing is killing me you know my back hurts this is killing my knees on this hard cement floor and the purpose yeah I know what you mean and I said you know what we need this is my brilliant insight we need knee pads I was very serious and and this person looked at me like I was the stupidest person they'd ever seen or like I'm working for this person this is great and said what we need is packing tables and I I looked at this I look at this person and I thought that was the smartest idea I had ever heard that the next day we got packing tables and I think we doubled our productivity that early stage by the way of amazon.com where we were so unprepared is probably one of the luckiest things that ever happened to us because it formed a culture of customer service in every department coming every single person in the company because we had to work with our hands so close to the customers making sure those orders went out really set up a culture that served us well and that is our goal to be earth's most customer centric company and then a a second round of fundraising about a year later or so we raised a million dollars and I had to talk to about 60 different people this is angel investor still given char capitalists were totally uninterested and this was a this was a time it wasn't like what people think of today and you know 1998 in 1999 you could raise sixty million dollars for an internet idea without a business plan with a single phone call you know it was a very different era but back in 1995 was very difficult to raise money okay and by the way it wasn't more difficult than it had been for the previous 20 years to raise money it just was sort of normally hard it's supposed to be hard to raise a million dollars and we and you know so with a lot of hard work we raised that million dollars for about 20 different angel investors who invested about $50,000 each and that was the original money that really funded amazon.com once you are looking at the odds in a realistic way it's very important for entrepreneurs to be realistic and so if you believe on that first day while you're writing the business plan that there's a 70% chance that the whole thing will fail and you know then that kind of relieves the pressure of self-doubt I mean it's certainly I don't have any doubt about whether we're gonna feel that's the likely outcome and and it just is and to pretend that it's not will lead you to do strange and you know unnatural things so we you know and then what you do with those early investment dollars you know so if you have $300,000 and then you have a million dollars what you do with that is early precious capital resources if you go about systematically trying to eliminate risk so you pick whatever the you know you think the biggest problems are and you try to eliminate them one at a time and that's that's how small companies get a little bit bigger and then a little bit bigger and a little bit bigger until finally at a certain stage you reach a transition where you have where the company has more control over its future destiny you know and when a company is very tiny it needs a tremendous amount of not only hard work but as we talked about earlier luck as a company gets bigger it starts to become a little more stable where if the you know at a certain point in time the company has a much bigger influence over its future outcome it needs a lot less luck and instead it needs the hard work and at that point in a way at that point there's a little bit more pressure because then if you fail you have nobody to blame but yourself I had what I could sort of be Anna Dillon childhood I mean I had two parents who loved me incredibly I also had a tremendous amount of contact with my grandparents my mom's parents in fact I spent all my summers on my grandfather's ranch not far from where we're sitting right now not far from San Antonio and spent three months every year from the age of four to age of 16 working on the ranch with my grandfather which was just an incredible incredible experience you know ranchers and anybody I think who works in rural areas they learn how to be very self-reliant and whether they're farmers whatever it is they're doing they have to rely on themselves for lasting a lot of things my grandfather did sort of all of his own veterinary care on the cattle we would you know repair the the d6 caterpillar bulldozer when it broke and had gears this big you know we would build cranes to lift the gears out so and this is just a very common sort of thing that that folks in in in in faraway places do I think it was a great experience I remember the very first occupation I wanted to be when I think it was about six years old as archaeologist and and this was even I would like to point out it's a point of pride pre Indiana Jones and then I wanted to be an astronaut and then later by the time I was in my high school years I wanted to be a physicist and then by the time I got to college I wanted to be a computer programmer and that's actually what I you know studied in school and and that and that's kind of you know what's led me along the path I'm on I had some family role models and I had some other people you know some sort of historical role models that I looked at too so certainly my my grandfather was a serious role model for me I just said fit so much time I you learned different things from grandparents and you learned from parents that's a it's a great I would encourage anybody to try to spend time not only with their parents but with their grandparents and but I and I also had I to people I always would read about and we're Thomas Edison and Walt Disney those were sort of my - you know biographical heroes I always been interested in in inventors and invention and Edison of course just you know for for a little kid is the and probably for adults too I still feel this way at least is that not only the symbol of that but the actual fact of that they just incredible inventor and and I've always felt that there's a certain kind of important pioneering that goes on from an inventor like Thomas Edison and then Disney was a different sort of thing he also you know a real pioneer and an inventor and doing new things but it seemed to me that he had this incredible capability to create a vision that he could get a large number of people to share because the the things that Disney invented like Disneyland you know the theme parks are so and they were such big visions that no single individual unlike a lot of the things that Edison worked on no single individual could ever pull them off and and Walt Disney really was able to get a big team of people working in a concerted direction I was very nerdy and good student so I was I was a in the goody-goody class of students and was always you know very working hard studying you know always did my homework on time I was a good student I liked school and the things I got into trouble on were like I lost my library privileges one time which was really you know inconvenient for me because I was I was actually four laughing I know you'll never believe this but laughing too loudly in the library I've had this laugh all my life I have no idea where it came from there was a period where my brother and sister wouldn't go see a movie with me it was too embarrassing but no I was I was sort of you know probably unnaturally on the side of not getting in trouble I mean I die you know I week by the time I was in high school we did some you know some pranks type things but they were the kind of pranks that at the end of the day the teachers actually secretly loved you know and I remember in fourth grade we had this wonderful contest which was you know the people in the class whoever there's some prize that can remember it was whoever could read the most Newbery Award winners in a year and I read through I didn't end up winning you know I think I read like thirty Newbery Award winners that year but somebody else read more and and the you know the stand out there is the old classic that I think so many people have read and enjoyed a wrinkle in time and I just remember loving loving that book you know later I was always a big fan of science fiction even from when I was you know in in elementary school reading various things and loved of course The Hobbit and and the in Tolkien's trilogy that follows on from that and this little town where my grandfather lived in the summers where I spent my time in the summer had a you know tiny little you know Andrew Carnegie style library that where all the books have been donated from the local citizens and I found I mean this was a very small library smaller than the room that we're sitting in now and it had but it had an extensive science fiction collection because just so happened one of the residents of this 3,000 person town had been a science fiction fan donated their whole collection and that started a love affair for me with you know people like Heinlein and Asimov and you know all the the well-known science fiction authors that you know persist to this day my math teacher in either fourth or fifth grade I can't remember mrs. McInerney she had a big influence on me my calculus teacher in high school mr. Moore he had a big influence on me mrs. delle champs who taught chemistry in high school mrs. rule who taught physics I really I I have been blessed with you know conscientious hard-working super-smart teachers and I don't know cuz you know I only got to go through school once so I don't know if I have a feeling I was lucky I know there are a lot of hard-working teachers out there but I seem to have had more than my fair share I always wanted to please you know it was one of the things and I think one of the things that these teachers who are really really good do is they recognize that the their students they sort of they get they create that environment where you can be very satisfied by what's by the process of learning that's going on so it's just it's like anything if you do something and you find it to be a very satisfying experience then you want to do more of it and so the great teachers somehow convey and their very attitude and their words and their actions and everything they do that this is an important thing you're learning and and by doing that you end up wanting to do more of it and more of it and more of it and I you know I think that's a a real talent that some people have to kind of convey the importance of that and to reflect it back to the students I was a very difficult to to punish for my parents because they would send me to my room and I was always happy to go to my room because I would just read so I quite you know if I talked back or did anything that was sort of you know you go you know go you're grounded and you have to stay in your room that was always fine with me so I was a big reader you know I I I remember playing lots of games in elementary school like kick the can and various you know tag and all the outdoor games and so on and and I did all those things I think I had a very kind of you know normal sort of except for my ranch experience which i think is very unusual for experiencing a great one who have had I think my my experience as a kid was a very normal one I was five and six years older than them so you know now that I'm you know 37 years old it's like we're of the same generation when I was you know 15 and they were ten and nine I had no time for them whatsoever it was it was you know they were always like the pesky younger sibling so I was trained at you know shake off and keep out of my room and you know I was constantly booby-trapping to house with various kinds of alarms and you know some of them were not just you know audible sounds but actually like you know physical booby-traps I think I occasionally worried my parents that they were gonna open the door one day and you know have 30 pounds of nails drop on their head or something I was always you know our garage was basically you know science fair central and my mom is a saint because she would you drive me to RadioShack you know multiple times a day to the point where she would finally say okay look will you please get your parts list straight before we go you know I can't handle more than one trip to RadioShack per day so there was a lot of that kind of stuff going on in our house I went to Princeton primarily to because I wanted to study physics and which and and was in it's such a fantastic place to study physics and and it went and things went fairly well until I got to quantum mechanics and I started I wrote there were about 30 people in the class by that point and it was so hard for me and I just remember there was a point in this where I realized you I'm never gonna be a great physicist there were three or four people in the class whose brains were so clearly wired differently to process these highly abstract concepts in you know so much more I mean I was doing well in terms of the grades I was getting but for me it was laborious hard work and for some of these truly gifted folks it was it was awe-inspiring for me to watch them because in a very easy almost casual way they could absorb concepts and solve problems that I would you know work 12 hours on and it was a it was a wonderful thing to behold at the same time I had been studying computer science and was really finding that that was something where I was drawn toward drawing I was drawn to that more and more and that turned out to be a great thing so I found one of the great things Princeton taught me is that I'm not smart enough to be a physicist I was very very lucky because in fourth grade which for me would have been as I've been it would've been about 1974 I had access to a mainframe computer there were no personal computers in 1974 and there was a company in Houston that had loaned excess mainframe computer time to this little elementary school and we had a teletype that was connected by an old you know acoustic modem he literally dialed a regular phone and picked up the handset and put it in this little cradle and and and you know nobody none of the teachers knew how to Brahe at this computer nobody did but there was a stack of manuals and me and a couple of other kids stayed after class and learned how to program this thing that worked well for maybe about a week and then we learned that the mainframe programmers in some central location somewhere in Houston had already programmed this computer to play Star Trek and from that day forward all we did was play Star Trek and that's actually something I should have mentioned about I used a large portion of my elementary school free time hours not only watching Star Trek the original of course but also playing Star Trek and everybody wanted to be the number all of my friends so the note we all wanted to be Spock and if you couldn't be Spock then you would be Captain Kirk and if you couldn't be Captain Kirk then it started to separate people wanted to be different some people wanted to be bones I never wanted to be bones I I would take us my third choice if I couldn't get Spock or Kirk I would take the computer is it somebody would ask computer was fun to play because people would ask you questions and they'd say computer and you'd say working I think it's always hard to know why you're drawn to a particular thing I think part of it is if you have a facility with that thing and of course it's satisfying to do it and so in a way that's self reinforcing and I and and and certainly I always had a facility with computers I always got along well with them and and it was you know was there's such extraordinary tools I mean you can you can teach them to do things and then they and then they actually do them I mean it's a kind of an incredible tool that we've built here in the 20th century um and that was a love affair that really did start in fourth grade and then when I by the time I got to high school I think when I was in 11th grade I got an Apple 2 plus and and you know continued fooling around with computers and then by the time I got to Princeton I was you know taking all the computer classes and actually not just learning how to hack but learning about algorithms and and you know some of the mathematics behind computer science and it's fascinating I mean it's really a very involving and fun subject I toyed with the idea of of starting a company and and even talked to a couple of friends about starting a company and ultimately decided that it would be smarter to wait and learn a little bit more about business and the way the world works you know one of the things that it's very hard to believe when you're 22 or 23 years old is that you don't already know everything it turns out I mean as I suspect you know people learn more and more as they get older that you seemed to learn you seem to realize that you know less and less every year that goes by I can only imagine that by the time I'm you know 70 I will realize I know nothing so that was a very good decision to not do that I went to work for a startup company but you know one in New York City that was building a network for helping brokerage firms clear trades I mean it's a kind of an obscure thing and it's not very interesting to go into but it used my technical skills and it was very fun work and I love the people I was working with and then that sort of from then on I started working sort of at the intersection of computers and finance and stayed on Wall Street for a long time ultimately worked for a company that did this thing called quantitative hedge fund trading so we were we what we did is we programmed the computers and then the computers made stock trades and that was very interesting too and that was where I was working when I when I came across the fact that the web was growing at 2,300 percent a year and that's what led to the forming of amazon.com I think the Internet in general amazon.com in particular this is still chapter one so you're sort of asking me about my story and it's still sort of the very beginning and which I think is you know it is interesting because there's you know there's there's still a lot of this to be built a lot of Technology to build a lot of innovations for customers to be built and also the financial side of the story is still playing itself out in real time but you know there are there's a lot of visibility on the internet and there has been for the last couple of years the first you know four years of the company you know we sort of worked in relative obscurity and it was you know we always had lots of supporters and we always had lots of skeptics and that's still the same today it's just that the level of visibility is so much higher so you know if you look at the six years that we've been doing business so far one of them exactly one of those six years we were not the underdog and that was 1999 and that that was the weird year for us now it's much more normal it's more what we're used to you know at this point in time we haven't built lasting company yet we still have a tremendous amount of hard work ahead of us but we have all the assets in place now we have eliminated the necessity for the luck that a start-up company requires and now you know our future is in our own hands as a team and as a company we have so many smart people we have so many customers who treat us so well and and and and we have the right kind of culture that obsesses over the customer if there's one reason we have done better than most of our peers in the internet space you know over the last six years it is because we have focused like a laser on customer experience and that really does matter I think in any business it certainly matters online where word-of-mouth is so very very powerful you know if you make a customer unhappy they won't tell five friends they'll tell five thousand friends so we are at a point now where we have all the things we need to build an important and lasting company and if we don't it will be shame on us I think in my particular case I laugh a lot so it is you know there are I think stress you can be one of the things that's very important to note about stress is the stress primarily comes from not taking action over something that you can have some control over so if I find that some particular thing is causing me to have stress that's a a warning flag for me what it means is there's something that I haven't completely identified perhaps in my conscious mind that is bothering me and I haven't yet taken any action on I find as soon as I identify it and make the first phone call or send off the first email message or whatever it is that we're gonna do to start to address that situation even if it's not solved the mere fact that we're addressing it dramatically reduces any stress that might come from it so stress comes from ignoring things that you shouldn't be ignoring I think in large part so stress doesn't come people get stress wrong all the time my opinion stress doesn't come from hard work for example you know you can be working incredibly hard and loving it and likewise you can be out of work and incredibly stressed over that so and likewise if you kind of use the you know use that as an analogy for what I was just talking about if you're out of work but you're going through you know a disciplined approach of you know series of job interviews and so on and working to remedy that situation you're going to be a lot less stressed than if you're just worrying about it and doing nothing well I think you know one of the things that I think people would be surprised to learn and I don't know if this is true for everybody but I I suspect it is and I think that at least at a certain age the basic foundational things about people are largely set and so you know I'm a lottery winner of a certain kind and I suspect if you were to go you know serve a lottery winners you would find that the core things about them don't really change because they won the lottery and I think I think that's probably and I think people are always very curious about that how does it foundationally fundamentally change a person when they win a lottery and I don't think it does very much one thing I find very motivating and it's encrypted I think this is probably a very common form of motivation or motive for a cause of motivation is I love people counting on me and so you know today it's so easy to be motivated because we have millions of customers counting on us at amazon.com we've got thousands of investors counting on us and we've got you know we're team of thousands of employees all counting on each other and so it's and that's fun do something you're very passionate about and don't try to chase what is kind of the hot passion of the day I think we actually saw this I think you see it all over the place in many different contexts but I think we saw it in the internet world quite a bit where you know it's sort of peak of the sort of internet you know mania and say 1999 you found people who were you know very passionate something they kind of left that job and decided I'm gonna you know could do something in the internet because it's you know it was almost like the you know the 18-49 Gold Rush in a way I mean you find that people if you go back and study the history of the 18-49 Gold Rush you find that you know at that time everybody who was in was within the shouting distance of California was you know they might have been a doctor but they quit being a doctor and they started panning for gold and that that almost never works and even if it does work you know according to some metric financial success or whatever it might be I suspect it leaves you ultimately unsatisfied so you really need to be very clear with yourself and I think one of the best ways to do that is this notion of projecting yourself forward to age 80 looking back on your life and trying to make sure you've minimized the number of regrets you have that works for that works for career decisions it works for family decisions you know do want I have a 14 month old son and it's very easy for me to if I think about myself when I'm 80 I know I want to watch that little guy grow up and so it it's I don't want to be 80 and think shoot you know I missed that whole thing and I don't have the kind of relationship with my son that I wished I had and so on and so on so if you think about that so I guess another thing that I would recommend to people is that they always take a long term point of view and I think this is something about which there's a lot of controversy you know there's a there's a you know something a lot of people and I'm just not one of them but that you should live for the now I think what you do is you think about the the great expanse of time ahead of you and try to make sure that you're planning for that in a way that's gonna leave you ultimately satisfied so this is just my this is the way it works for me and I mean this is everybody needs to find that for themself so I think there are a lot of paths to satisfaction and you need to find one that works works for you if you are a lottery winner as I am then one of the things that you you get a chance to do at some point in your life is to be a philanthropist and so I you know I didn't grow up hoping you know boy maybe I'll be a threat philanthropist one day that wasn't ever on my list of you know archaeologist astronaut and those things I wanted to be physicist I never I ain't in large part because I never expected to have the means to be a philanthropist but I think that if you win a lottery of this kind of size that one of the things that that the over time you have an obligation to do is to think about the ways that that that wealth can be used in a highly leveraged way I also think by the way it's really easy to give away money in highly unleveraged ways where it's just a waste of money and I suspect that it takes as much sort of time energy focus and hard work to effectively give away money as it does to get it in the first place I think one of the things that's most important to me is you know this the one of the really the notions that that the United States was founded on in this and that is Liberty so it is it is a very it's a very difficult thing I mean there's lots of very interesting stuff to think about in this regard and you know just so happens that a free market economy sort of a capitalist system which has a lot of Liberty mixed in with it that we all get to decide you know how we're going to go about making our own living and so on and so on that happens to also be a very effective way of deploying an economy so that you get an economy which mostly makes sense you know things mysteriously because of that invisible hand tend to work out I remember there was a time I may have these statistics slightly wrong few years ago there was a heatwave in the south that killed 3% of chickens and I think egg prices doubled because there were 3 percent fewer chickens well that means that the number of chickens is roughly right even though there's nobody deciding how many chickens there should be alright so that is a very interesting fact I think that that the the free market economy which has a lot of which by necessity involves a lot of Liberty just happens to work well in terms of allocating resources but imagine a different world imagine a world where you know some incredibly artificially intelligent computer could actually do a better job than the invisible hand of allocating resources and were to say you know there shouldn't be this many chickens there should be this many chickens just a few more or a few less well that might even lead to more aggregate wealth so it might be a society that if you give up Liberty everybody could be a little wealthier now the question that I would pose is if that turned out to be the world is that a good trade personally I don't think so personality could be a terrible trade and I sometimes worry about that because I think it's a coincidence that you know that Liberty tends to do such a good job of you know sort of creating an economy that functions well you know if you look over over long periods of time you know look over hundreds of years and look at the average sort of lifecycle of a new technology what you find is that it's getting compressed and compressed and compressed so the rate of change is getting faster and faster every decade that goes by they're sort of more important discoveries per unit time than there were in the previous decade and and a lot of these discoveries tend to you know have two uses I mean technologies in jannat end to be agnostic with with respect to whether they could be used for good or used for evil and I think that you know over the next 50 years you know we are gonna face a lot of very tough decisions as a society in in how we make sure that we are harnessing those technologies for good purposes I think Liberty giving people the freedom to you know as long as they're not hurting somebody else do what they want it's super important I think it's the core essence of the American Dream and I think at times we as a people get confused about it I mean I think one of the things that you see come up in in various places and people talk about it under different labels sometimes they talk about it as a lack of personal responsibility and other kinds of labels but what it really is is is I think people should you know carefully reread the first part of the Declaration of Independence because I think sometimes we as a society start to get confused and think that we have a right to happiness but if you read the Declaration of Independence it talks about life liberty and the pursuit of happiness nobody has a right to happiness you should have a right to pursue it and I think the core of that is Liberty"

      "transcript": "oh yeah thank you very much so this gentleman certainly needs no introduction my name is Marc Bezos and you're all welcome to call me what my friends do they usually just refer to me as Jeff's brother by the way just so you know it actually does go both ways my brother has a TED talk about small acts of kindness being a volunteer firefighter and it has millions of views and every once in a while somebody will stop me and say I love your TED talk about being a firefighter and small acts of kindness and I if I I usually you know say well thank you but that's really my brother his TED talk but if I'm in a hurry I just say thank you thank you yes absolutely but if any of you do get confused I'm the one with the smaller bank account to your left so he's the big brother so Jeff before we get started I think you know this is a obviously a crowd of influential people people who are starting out I think we might as well just make the most of their time I'm just going to dive right into this if you don't mind let's go you are captain of industry amazon.com private spaceflight with Blue Origin the Washington Post levels of you know Fame and wealth that are hard to comprehend I guess you know one question that probably is at the top of everyone's mind is if you had to choose one thing what would you say is your favorite part of having me as a little brother [Applause] I think I've taken the liberty of writing some thoughts I know you answer this and there are many things I love about having mark as a brother but what he just did is number one at the top of this what I am with my brother I just laugh continuously yeah because he's the funniest guy in my life well thank you you're an easy audience and I appreciate I am actually an easy audience that is true he is I am alright so so here's what we're going to do if all of you don't mind so the fact that you know a fireside chat among brothers this is not unique for us this is something that we do quite often it's rare that we have you know a couple thousand more closest friends with us yeah and it's also really usually actually have a fire yes and bourbon yeah which we don't have now but now so and what what we're going to talk about the things that I'm gonna chat with Jeff about or not the sorts of things perhaps that you would hear in most interviews because you know I don't you know 2p2 rules is not really my jam so we're not going to talk about those things but you know we do have a shared history you know so what I really want to focus on is you know the influences and the inspirations that have led to some of the things the foundation of you know what is a little intimidating he knows way too much it's so and what I'd like to do is invite all of you to join in on you know what is some of our greatest hits I guess from my point of view and because we have such a shared history what I've done wants to gesture grin as I've gone through and taking the liberty of pulling together a bunch of family photos so I'm gonna be throwing some of those up behind us and just so that you guys can sort of understand so if we start talking shorthand you'll understand what it is that we're referring to so all sound good all right so I am gonna and I appreciate your page that this is not the sort of thing that I usually do so I appreciate your patience so we're just going to dive right into it so when we were kids we would spend every summer on our grandfather's ranch in South Texas we called our grandfather pop that's pop there's pop right there we were probably just fixing that windmill yes always fixing windmills yeah before you were climbing them and smashing bottles upon them which he did recently in a Instagram video so you know one of the things that we that we would do you know every summer it was really a magical experience there's a little Jeff yeah that was my maximum cuteness right there all downhill from there that that's a 1962 International Harvester scout we all learn to drive beyond that car that car once you can drive that car you can drive anything and then this is so there's the two of us that is Jeff teaching me how to open or close gate which doesn't seem like it would be that complicated but I was having trouble wire gap gates are tough and then this is that's red well that's Christina or sister Christina but the horse red that's red that's yeah so I guess one of the things that that we learn every summer yeah this is pop again so there was as we as we alluded to with the windmills there was always work to be done on the ranch and yeah one of the the things that you know I think we learned to value and you've spoken about this in the past is the the role that resourcefulness self-reliance yeah plays it's certainly on a place like the ranch but yeah can you talk a little bit about well so one of the great things that you learn first of all we had a very fortunate lucky childhood we got to spend a lot of time with pop and our grandparents and you learn different things from grandparents than you learned from parents it's just a very different relationship I've spent all my summers on his ranch from age 4 to 16 and he was incredibly soft for Lion you know if you're in the middle of nowhere in a rural area you don't pick up the phone and call somebody when something breaks you figure out how to fix it yourself and so as a kid you got to I got to see him solve all these problems and be a real problem solver he even did his own bed Neri work he would make his own needles for the suture up the cattle with he would like take a piece of wire use a blowtorch to heat up pounded flat sharpen it drill a hole through it make a needle and some of the cattle even survived and so you know but but you did we learned a lot of things from watching him because he would he would take on major projects that he didn't really know how to do then figure out how to do them you know a good example of that is you know you guys built a house yeah I think I think he bought this out of a Sears catalog it was a kid house and we built that thing somebody came out it all showed up in big boxes and somebody a professional came out and poured the foundation and then we did the rest of it but I'm pretty sure it was quite a project in going there some of that you can see some of the cows there that didn't survive procedure so you know when I was going through these it certainly I came across this photo yeah I'm not exactly sure what it was you're doing here almost positive looks like we got wrong maybe that vent really pissed me off I don't know that's certainly well I think there's a couple things here first of all OSHA would not be pleased with the way you're on that ladder and you know here's as though you've you're crafting a spear I don't know what I'm doing yeah so and you know I think that you know if you can talk a little bit I know that there's you know this bulldozer in the background that's a caterpillar bulldozer that my grandfather bought used for five thousand dollars which is an enormous bargain you know this thing it should cost way more than that the reason it was so cheap is it was completely broken the transmission was stripped the hydraulics didn't work and so we spent basically a whole summer repairing it and big giant gears would arrive by mail order from Caterpillar and we would you know we couldn't even move the gear so Mike the first thing my grandfather did was build a crane to move the gear so that's that kind of you know self-reliance and resourcefulness and the you know there's also there's a story that you know is somewhat legendary in our family one of the things that pop did one summer it was a little out of character oh I know what story you're talking about so he really actually was a very careful conservative sort of person not prone to crazy acts or anything who kind of introspective and even and very imp and introverted quiet person but one day he was all by himself he had driven to the ranch and he was at the main gate to the ranch and he forgot to put the car in park and so when he got to the gate he noticed that the car was slowly rolling downhill toward the gate he thought this is fantastic I have just enough time to unlatch the gate throw the gate open the car is gonna drive right through and those will be wonderful he almost got the gate unlatched when the car hit the gate and it caught his thumb between the gate and the fence post and it stripped all the flesh off of his thumb it was hanging there by a tiny little thread and he was so angry at himself that he ripped that piece of flesh off and threw it in the brush got back in the car drove himself to the emergency room in Dili Texas 16 miles away and when he got there they said this is great we can reattach that where is it and he said I threw it in the brush they drove back with the nurses and everybody and they all they looked for hours for the thumb and they never found that piece of flesh something probably eaten it so they they take them back to the emergency room and they said look you have two choices you're gonna have to have a skin graft for that and we can sew your your thumb to your stomach and leave it there for six weeks that's the best way to do it or we can just cut a piece of skin graft from your butt and just suture it on and it won't ever be as good but the advantage is your thumb won't be sewn to your stomach for six weeks and he said I'll take option to just do this skin graft from my butt and they did that it was very successful it worked fine and he but the funniest thing about this story is that I have incredibly vivid memories when we all do of him he definitely his mornings were completely ritualized who'd wake up eat breakfast cereal read the newspaper and shave with an electric razor for a really long time like he would shave with that electric razor for like 15 minutes and while he's eating his cereal and when he was done shaving his face with that razor then he would take two quick passes over his thumb because his thumb group but hair which by the way did not bother him at all no he was completely unfazed by unfazed so thumb but hair aside you know the the value of resourcefulness right and and self-reliance what how do you how do you apply that to you know the work that you do on a daily basis how do you well I think you know there are a lot of entrepreneurs and and people pursuing dreams and passions in this car you know you always you you the whole point of of moving things forward is you run into problems you run into failures things don't work you have to back up and try again each one of those times when you have a step back and you back up and you try again you using resourcefulness you're using self-reliance you're trying to invent your way out of a box and I have with tons of examples at Amazon where we've had to do this we've failed so many times we have write the iowa's think of us is a great place to feel because we're good at it we have so much practice and I get to give you one example we many years ago now we started we wanted a third party selling business because we knew we could add selection to the store that way and we started Amazon auctions nobody came I think maybe our mother the only one who purchase something I bought a coffee cup you got a coffee I did okay so there were those who purchasers and and and that's an we so we said well look we do we open this thing called Z shops we train which was like fixed price auctions again nobody came I didn't use that and then finally and each one of these failures it's like a year you half long and so we're trying to invent new things and we finally came across this idea of putting the third-party selection on the same detail page is the same product detail pages that we had our own inventory on our own retail inventory on we called this marketplace and it started working right away and so that just that resourcefulness of trying new things figuring things out what the customers really want yep yeah pays off and everything and it pays off even in your daily lives you know how do you help your children what's the right thing my wife has a great saying we let our kids use even now they're 17 through 12 but even when they were 4 we would let him use our knives and by the time they were I don't know maybe 7 or 8 we would let him use a certain power tools and my wife best to her credit she has this great fascia so I would much rather have a kid with nine fingers than a resourceless kid and which I just think is a fantastic attitude about life luckily you have resourceful kids with 10 fingers yeah exactly and you know I know that resourcefulness is so important you actually if it was a prerequisite for the selection of a spouse right so this is yeah I had I did in my 20s this is you know you way you know pre tender pre-match calm and so I had this but at a certain point I decided I wanted to get married and I had all my friends setting me up and I had my list of criteria and this was like good old-fashioned blind dates I went on dozens of blind dates and it turns out it kept meeting people who were professional blind daters and I sort of became a professional blind dater and so we would sit down and most of the conversation was quickly about how yeah we're not right for each other but how do you meet people and you know it's actually turned into a right but when I was time my friends my criteria one of the ones that I would list was that I wanted a woman who could get me out of a third-world prison and my friends were like what are your future plans you know and I said no it's just a visualization for somebody really resourceful because I you don't want to go through life with teammates who aren't resourceful and so you do want to go through life with people who if you need could get you out of prison hypothetically speaking hypothetically speak yeah so you know so this is a picture from the recent that was last summer I think yeah we took that we were on a family vacation and I you know so this one jumped out at me because you know you're doing Mackenzie curls there with your wife and you're looking a little buff and so that of course you know made me think of this now as internet memes go swole Jeff is pretty cool right so you know if swole mark raced across the internet I'd be pretty psyched but you know I I this got sent to me by so many people variations of this right oh my god your brother what sauce your brother yeah and then you know but it confused me because in all honesty this is what I grew up with [Laughter] [Applause] yeah I'm just saying right so that you know where when you guys saw us well Jeff I was like I was surprised too right I mean Isis yeah this image sexy right that I I remember that I am how old are your Halloween costume I am one of I had some friends and we went as the foo no no no wait wait wait wait wait there you go here we go that is yeah yeah the winners Ladykillers chicks love that they love that that we were we were very successful in high school so as fitness goes and then and then you know there was this guy who's like what late 90s Jeff right something like that and you know your eating habits at this point in your life we're not great no my this is this is you won't even believe the story it's gonna have to believe me that I tell you this is true when my wife and I got married I had been eating a whole can for a couple of years I had been eating for breakfast every morning a whole can of Pillsbury biscuits so I would wake up in the morning I would preheat the oven to 375 I would get out the bacon the baking sheet I would crack open the Pillsbury biscuits place them on there and with butter and I would eat the whole coke in and I was skinny Ezreal and it was just and I am I after watching meat when so then we get married and she watched me do this every morning as my spouse for like three months and then she finally stopped me one day and she said do you know what's in that and I was like honestly that wasn't even a concept for me that there was something in food you know that there was like I had never read a nutrition label in my life I eat what tasted good to me and so she kind of showed me the ingredients label and we had a little very rudimentary discussion about nutrition and I stopped eating the biscuits well I'm frankly very happy and somewhat surprised that you survived all of that we're glad you're still with us so she was incredulous so one of the things I want to talk about a question that that we've talked about before you were 30 years old in 1994 when you decided to start amazon.com you had a great job you had I remember you had a great apartment on the Upper West Side married for a year had been married for you had not been eating biscuits for nine months and I'm just you know how did you go through making the decision to drop it was a very good job and take it take this chance it all seems very obvious now right this many years later that it paid off but at the time it was not obvious no no it was and and and I did do a lot of soul searching I I went to my boss at the time and I really liked my job and I told my boss I was gonna go do this thing start an internet bookstore and my wife had already told my wife and she's like great let's go and I I said so I'm also gonna do this he's like this is a good idea so I think this is a good idea but it'd be an even better idea for somebody who didn't already have a good job and that sort of made some logical sense to me and he convinced me to think about it for a couple of days so I went away I was really trying to get my head around how to think about this and I think for me the right way to make that kind of very personal decision because those decisions are personal they're not like data driven business decisions there they are you know what does your heart say and for me it was I could the best way to think about it was to project myself forward to age 80 and said look when I'm 80 years old I want to have minimized the number of regrets that I have I don't want to be 80 years old in a quiet moment of reflection thinking back over my life and and catalog you a bunch of major regrets and I think that regrets our biggest regrets in most cases you can murder somebody okay you'd regret that but in most cases our biggest regrets turn out to the acts of omission its paths not taken and they haunt us we wonder what would have happened I loved that person and I never told him and then they married somebody else I did you know I didn't do this and so that's the frame of mind that I put myself in and I and once I did that once I thought about that way it was immediately obvious to me I knew that when I'm 80 I would never regret trying this thing that I was super excited about and failing if it failed fine I would be very proud of the fact when I'm 80 that I tried and I also knew that it would always haunt me if I didn't try and so that would be a regret it would be a hundred percent chance of regret if I didn't try and basically a zero percent chance of regret if I tried and failed so I think that's a useful metric for any important life decision and this is this is you know our sister took this photo but you know she was I don't understand why she thought this was a momentous occasion you and Mackenzie yeah we're about to take off driving across the country to start Amazon go to Seattle and that's a yellow lab kamala named after a Star Trek character we're so happy to have these family photos but we can't for the life of us figure out why Kristina bothered to take them but we're so glad she did and then you know she also was smart enough to tell you to leave the dog yeah she saved us probably because we were to drive across the country with the dog which was probably not a good idea she said I keep the dog and when you after you guys get settled I'll send you the dog so what a question I have is you know we just talked about the fact that you know there was certainly no guarantee that Amazon was going to or no there never any kind of startup I think what would Jeff Bezos be doing if this hadn't worked out I I I think I it's a good question and nobody ever really knows what life what twists and turns life takes my best guess is I would be very happy software engineer yeah and working on anything in particular today I might be I don't know I'm very very curious about machine learning and artificial intelligence and and you know we're doing a lot of that probably I would be attracted to that field today and if you know I thought this question I not sure exactly how you would answer it but I am curious you know like your fantasy job not the one that would pay the bills well that I have I have is Union and you know what it is I think he knows my guess is bartender I and I do have by the way I'm really glad I'm wearing my honey badger don't care a t-shirt there it and that thank you for that photo because it looks like I've had about four of those yeah I appreciate you that's like a Bloody Mary that's a really start what are brothers for early start but yeah I have to make a mean cocktail I I do I pride myself on my craft cocktails and I I am and I I do have this fantasy that I want to be a bartender and I know that it is a fantasy like if I were actually a bartender right there fight like it's I'm glamorized the job in my mind I know that but but I love people I like talking to people I love making cocktails you're not very fast I'm super slow it would have to be a bar we'd have to charge a lot for drink and they would and you'd be Europe there'd be a big sign behind the bar that says you can have a good or you can have it fast which is what but yeah I have I have a kind of fantasy there so if we could shift gears a little bit I want to talk about Blue Origin yeah so Blue Origin is your private spaceflight commercial spaceflight company and we'll talk in a minute about all the work that you're doing in that regard but I guess what I want to focus on for a minute or two is the inspiration for that the passion behind it so you know I'm gonna put up a phone this one's really more embarrassing for me than for you but so here we are this is like you're about to block a soccer kick or something that's I'm auditioning for Alvin sorry the far right there is our dad that's Chico in the man over there on the right he's Cuban and it's a kind of you know it's one of those tricks at the universe place on you that my mom's name is Jackie and my name is Jeff and there's no J in Spanish and so he still has to call her Jackie and me yes but he sounds exactly like Ricky Ricardo delightful guy but yeah that's the whole crew that's the whole crew there so you were the bounding Torian of your high school in Miami and I had the opportunity to give a speech yeah at your graduation and you I think the vast majority of your speech was about colonizing space I think all of it I think all of it is yeah right so I still remember your closing line I mean even then it stood out to me yeah and it was do you remember I do I remembered the closet it was something like space the final frontier meet me there that was a that was yeah so and I've been passionate about space rockets and rocket engines since I was a 5 year old boy and so you know I want to talk about that a little bit cuz you know we've talked about or you know it certainly the story you've told about having seen the moon landing in 1969 right so this is pop again that's Christina that's our sister on the floor so this was a very familiar setting for us anytime pop was watching TV yeah he had perfectly good furniture I can see it but yeah no place for laid on the floor to watch television and you remember as seen exactly like this when you were watching the lunar landing yeah no he yeah and I I do think you never know exactly you know you don't choose your passions your pastures choose you how you how they are form you're never completely sure but I do think you get imprinted somehow early on with certain things you just get excited about them and because you're excited you pay more attention and they grow and that's spaces like that for me I watched Neil Armstrong step under the moon when I was five and you know I I do wonder I know that pop was a big fan of the Watergate trials also watch those and yeah I'm setting just like this he was kind of a news junkie anyway religiously you obsessively watched the Watergate hearings I you know do you think at some level that might have influenced you at least by the post yeah it's hard to know you know I bought the post because I think it's an important institution and you know I told the team at the time like you know I the post at the time had it was kind of financially upside-down had a lot of work to do no fault of their own the internet had really taken the wind out of newspaper companies and I said look you know I would not buy a say financially upside down salty snack food company but post is real institutional I think matters and and needs some runway so that's why I did it I happen to know the guy who owned it for so many years yeah Don Graham who is just an amazing person and so that all worked out but did watching the Watergate hearings with pop on the carpet have influenced that probably right at some level you know so going back to to Blue Origin I mean you know space has been such a big part of your life for so long and certainly every memory that's induced and we lived in Houston those marks not too far from our house I think that you know it's science fiction science fiction movies books you know I my passion for that stuff certainly came from you know watching you enjoy it so much but you know I look at this picture and you know I thought to myself well I've seen that face recently haha and it's and this so this is you're standing on the landing pad yeah in West Texas the launch and landing site in West Texas where you're do launching and landing a new Shepherd vehicle for Blue Origin so if you could just take a minute or two and help us understand what is Blue Origin up - well Blue Origin is the vision for Blue Origin is millions of people living and working space and the key thing is we have to dramatically reduce the cost of access to space right now space travel is very expensive and the reason it's expensive it's not hard to understand it's because we throw the hardware away after each use and so we need reusable rocket vehicles and that's what Laura John is working on we're working on making sure that we don't have to throw the plane away every time after you fly out you know to your vacation destination that would definitely increase the cost of your vacation and and so that's what we need to do and we can do it it's totally possible and I think it's I think it's important yeah this is uh this is what the booster looks like when it's coming back down yeah in this cowboy hat still has champagne stains that's right your head still kind of stains so you know I guess you know if we could ton of my favorite shots this is the booster and pin and that's West Texas it's beautiful country so if you could just talk a little bit about you know you've been passionate about space your whole life you know you know this is not just a plaything for you know guarded Blue Origin is doing is not you know no nice thing I mean no actually this is a important way my view is like Minh credibly important work that needs to be done and done as quickly as possible and I have my own reasons why I believe that they can be explained pretty simply and it's not for me it's not the there's a very kind of common argument that's been around for a long time actually kind of first popularized by arthur c clarke so in all civilizations become spacefaring or extinct and this is the kind of plan B argument that you know when earth is destroyed somehow we'd better make sure that we don't have all of our eggs in one basket and I hate the plan B argument I think you know Plan B with respect to earth being destroyed is make sure a plan a works so we have sent robotic probes to every planet in this solar system believe me this is the best one we know that it's not even close you know my friends who say they want to move to Mars or something I still like why don't you go live in Antarctica for a year first because it's a garden paradise compared to Mars and so we really this is that this planet is so amazing it's a jewel in our solar system and we have if you take baseline energy usage on earth and just compound it at a few percent a year for just a few hundred years you have to cover the entire Earth's surface in solar cells so that's not going to happen so we have two choices we either go out into space or we switch over to a civilization of stasis and personally I do not like the idea of stasis you know we have it's our grandchildren and their grandchildren will live in a much better world if they can continue to advance and develop and use more energy and and all of the things that we've enjoyed for hundreds of years as a civilization of growth I don't even really believe in stasis I think things are either growing or shrinking I don't I think stasis is highly highly unusual and in real life doesn't exist I don't even think Liberty is consistent with the idea of stasis I mean if you get real stasis somebody's gonna have to tell you how many kids you can have how much energy you can use there'll be all kinds of things that just aren't consistent with with liberty and freedom so but in space we have for all practical purposes unlimited resources we could have a trillion humans in the sewer system and wouldn't still wouldn't be crowded and so then if you had a trillion humans you'd have thousand Einsteins and a thousand Mozart's and a thousand DaVinci's and how cool would that be but we have to go to space and we have to go to space to save earth that's why this work is so important and we don't have forever to do it we've now gotten so big as a civilization on earth that we kind of have to hurry and so I believe that the you know the really in the kind of a long time frame the most important work I'm doing is is Blue Origin and pushing forward to get humanity established in the solar system so and what sort of time frame are we talking about well the grand vision you know trillion humans in the solar system and so on that's I mean that's hundreds of years but you know but in and we can have in just a couple of decades I think we can have a much lower cost space travel and then we can start to you know have really a dynamic entrepreneurial explosion in space you know you can't really have much entrepreneurial activity in space today because the just the basic price of admission is too expensive I mean just to do anything even something relatively small in space is still very very expensive we need to lower the cost of admission so that thousands of entrepreneurs can have companies in space kind of like what we've seen on the internet right now you can't be two kids in a dorm room can make Facebook but they can't make a space company it's not practical we want I want to make that practical yeah just so you know and and you know that leads me to think about some of the conversations we've had this is another view of those mountains in West Texas you know sitting around that fire pit and some of the most profound conversations for me anyway that that we've had are around the topic of long-term thinking yeah which is something that you've really embraced and you know you've brought to the businesses that you run and you know if you just talk a little bit I don't think that most people who are running businesses or who are you know making even starting a company like Blue Origin allow themselves to think in centuries even for visions for a vision of what they're creating or you know it Amazon I know that you've said you know five to seven year time frames for experiments that you're running where does it talk to me about long-term thinking and your point of view on well long-term thinking is lever it lets you do things that you could not do or couldn't even conceive of doing if you were thinking short-term so if I you know that's why you know that I have a project where I'm helping a group of people build the 10,000 year clock it kind of ticks once a year and dongs once a century and the cuckoo comes out once a millennium it's a bits of big 500 foot tall thing inside a mountain right here inside one of those mountain range and the ten thousand your clock is a symbol I don't think it'll do anything for the first few hundred years but after a few years once it's old you will start to pay attention to older symbols and so a few hundred years from now I hope that people will think about that as a symbol for long-term thinking if I you know if I collaborated with somebody here in this audience and I said look I want you to solve what world hunger and I want you to do it in five years you would properly reject the opportunity you would say look it's not possible it's not practical but if I said look I want you to solve world hunger in a hundred years that's a job you'd take because it's a much more addressable problem you can first create the conditions you have time to create the conditions where then you can solve the problem and so that's that's a very important way of thinking and and I find it's and it works with everything I mean you have to back up and find the right time horizon for what you're trying to do but you know at Amazon we probably do most of our things we expect that to get some results in sort of five six seven eight years but we find a lot of our you know other companies that compete against us in various ways they're often trying to get things done and you know two or three years and so we can do things that you know if you if you if everything has to work in two to three years then that limits what you can do if you give yourself the breathing room to say okay I'll I'm okay if it takes seven years all of a sudden you have way more opportunities the one of the things I want to shift to here is when when we are raising a glass around a fire and you usually have a toast the standard toast a standard toast that you usually kick off the night with yawn its to adventure and fellowship to adventure in fellowship and literally that's like that he kicks off its about every dinner with right every dinner every night and it's you know it's interesting to me because I know that you are somebody who pays attention to the words that you use right you're careful about the words that you use and those seem like very specific words so I was wondering if we could just talk a little bit about why adventure and why fellowship and as I was thinking about this you know it occurred to me that you've been taking some adventures you know throughout your your whole life here your grandmother nanny yeah that's nanny and you know when you were a kid you used to take road trips with yeah Danny and Wally by armed Caravan Club road trips you had 300 Airstream trailers here yeah all driving down the highway together that we'd park so before they were hipster cool big wagon wheel formations yeah there was no avocado toast at this and and you know you and I had the good the fun opportunity we drove across the country yeah yeah and the defender in there that was a great that was an amazing trip that was a very truss and then you know we also we spent three days on horseback that was a 50 mile ride in West Texas yeah every day is super fun my butt hurt yeah I apologize about the quality like I said this is not what I do so this is the best I could do here but I did take this picture that's Jeff sleeping on that trail ride it was cold this is that ring of you can see how I'm keeping that pillow from my this is when you know it's really good to be a mammal you provide your own heat provide your own body heat keep the frost away from your face I guess I guess you know all of these adventures you know this is this is a you're dropping down into a cave yeah rappelling down that was really fun that you were on that trip I was on that trip too you know but so you know people have asked me this you know because they know that we we go on a lot of adventures together and they're a bit incredulous when I when I answered the question but they asked me you know is he on his phone the whole time can he ever unplug and they're incredulous when I say honestly he's not on his phone that much he's just you know when you you're just your we drove across the country and you know it's not that you didn't do the work but most of the time it was it was this and I see the same thing when you're you know with your kids and you know it's how do you I don't have a fraction of the responsibility that you do and I find that I'm always wrestling with you know my phone I'm just curious like what sort of discipline or what sort of you know how do you go about compartmentalizing the way that I you know I do not so like when I have dinner I have dinner whether it's with friends or with my family and I like to if I'm I like to be talking to the people I'm with I like to do whatever I'm doing I don't like to multitask it bothers me if I'm reading my email I want to be really reading my email when I my mom tells a story about me being in Montessori School and then they couldn't get me to switch tasks so the Montessori School teacher would have to literally pick up my chair and just move me to the next task station so I don't know it's not like it's not intentional isn't neat I don't need discipline in order to not be checking my email for me it's very natural I love being present and whatever I'm working and I'm happy multitasking but I do it serially you know I will spin and then and you don't you know honestly if something really important is happening somebody will find me you know it's not like I have to check my text messages every five minutes or something like that it's not that's not a not a big deal right and usually when they do find you it's rarely to give you good news oh yeah no if somebody comes and says you need to check your text messages right now that's got to be bad news that's usually actually honestly you know it's usually a family thing it's like a medical thing or something it's like but it's not I I think that it's probably just a very personal decision I think some people are very good at multitasking and so they can do two things one sand you know I am at restaurant with my wife or something and we'll see a couple both texting but every once why they show show that their phones and it seems like they're having a very nice date so I'm not sure there's anything wrong with that it's just not how I'm wired got it so you know going back to you know the sense of adventure you know what can you talk to me a little bit about what the role that adventure plays in in your life and you know what is it that it brings to you it's it's more than just a distraction ya know I so that when I say to adventure Fellowship for me adventure is a you can choose we all get to choose our life stories and it's the choices that define us not our gifts everybody in this room has many gifts I have many gifts you can never be proud of your gifts because they're gifts they were given to you you might be you know tall or you might be really good at math or you might be extremely beautiful or handsome or you know there are there many gifts and you can only be proud really of your choices because those are the things that you are that you're that you are acting on and one of the most important choices that each of us has and you know this just as well as I do is you can choose a life of ease and comfort or you can choose a life of service and adventure and when you're 80 which one of those things you think you're gonna be more proud of you're gonna be more proud of having chosen a life of service or adventure you see this in your firefighting work and everything else you do Robin Hood so on and so on and I feel that that is a you know for me adventure is a shorthand way of thinking about that got it and I think that one of the other things that we've talked about when we talk about adventure is you know exposing yourself to new things right and and you know maintaining that childlike sense of wonder totally and you know I know that you know this is important to you certainly in in our personal lives which is why we do all of these fun things but it also plays an important role in you know how you approach the businesses that you're involved in them if you want to be an inventor of any kind inventing a new you know a new service offering for customers or a new product or anything the being an inventor requires because the world is so complicated you have to be a domain expert I mean in a way even if even if you're not at the beginning you have to learn learn learn learn learn enough so to become a domain expert but the danger is once you've become a domain expert you can be trapped by that knowledge and so inventors have this paradoxical ability to have that you know 10,000 hours of practice and be a real domain expert and have that beginner's mind have that that look at it freshly even though they know so much about the domain and that's the key to inventing you have to have both and I think that is intentional I think all of us have that inside of us and we could all do it but you have to be intentional about it you have to say yeah I am gonna become an expert and I'm gonna keep my beginner's mind but I know that I mean this is so important you're always you know it's it's a regular refrain even at Amazon this far into it that it's still day one day one so you know one of these so I guess the other half of that toast is you know to fellowship yeah right to adventure and fellowship and again fellowship is a very specific word right you know friendship is much more common so what why did you what like what about what is it about fellowship me the word fellowship conjures a vision of traveling down the road together it's a it's a it has more journey in it yeah I'm in French so my friendship would be is great it would be great to bellow ship captures friendship and traveling that path together this is so this is down at the bottom but there we are yeah there's our brother and there's McKenzie our brother-in-law Steve yeah friend Danny no I'm great great trip that was that was quite you don't have to worry about checking your phone there no no no radio signals down there so you know another adventure I guess an opportunity for adventure and and fellowship fun trip was this trip and you know we were out at sea for 30 days young and we did this when you've been out at sea for 30 days this looks like it's in focus so but why don't you you know can you talk a little bit about what we learned excuse me by the way where I be R game is very strong are you crushing me on the beard game I don't even try the beard my beard thing doesn't work at all I get that crap beard but the we this is the recovery expedition we went and recovered the Apollo 11 saturn v f1 engines from the bottom of the atlantic under 14,000 feet of water they'd been resting there peacefully for more than four decades and we did it it was the it was a it was an incredible adventure the captain there were 60 people on the boat including our mother Jackie and she was the only woman on the boat so it was 59 men and my mom and when I first got on the boat the captain came and found me and this is a big 300 foot boat with you know a moon pool and and diving submersibles remotely operated vehicles very high-tech the captain came very nice Norwegian guy and he said I we've never had a woman on the boat before and I've taken the liberty of removing all of the pornography from the common areas and I just wanted to make sure that's okay with you and I was like yeah that sounds good that's good I never did find that stash and so so we were successful we recovered those engines and we're so where are they one of them is at the Smithsonian and one of them is at the Seattle Museum of Flight well hopefully there'll be some other five-year-old who runs into them and inspired as you were you know they're incredible engineered objects I mean still today there's probably no rocket engine that has been more successful than the Saturn 5 f1 so you know one of the as I was putting this together and looking at all of these pictures and you know thinking about the adventures that we've had together and you know I again you know knowing how much time and effort you put into Amazon in the Washington Post and Blue Origin and you know I also happen to know that you're a devoted husband and beloved father with your kids you have a fantastic relationship the bezos's have a lot of kids we has four I have four sister has three yeah we're making sure that the population doesn't go that we need we need to go into space yeah well one of the I guess one of the questions I have is you know how do you go about establishing that work-life balance that everybody you know talks about and thinks about you've got I mean you live a big life right and how do you how do you I get down in a lot I get it I teach senior executive kind of leadership classes at Amazon for our most senior execs and I also teach or not teach but I also speak to interns so kind of all across the spectrum and I get this question about work-life balance all the time from from both ends of the spectrum and the my view is I don't even like the phrase work-life balance I think it's misleading I like the phrase work life harmony because I know that if I am energized at work happy at work feeling like I'm adding value part of a team whatever energizes you that makes me better at home it makes me a better husband a better father and likewise if I'm happy at home it makes me a better employee a better boss all the things it's not about it's not primarily about there may be crunch periods where it's about the number of hours and the week but that that's not the that's not the real thing usually it's about do you have energy and is the is your work depriving you of energy or is your work generating energy for you and you know there are people everybody in this room notice people you fall into these two camps you're in a meeting and the person comes in the room some people come into the meeting and they add energy to the meeting other people come into the meeting and the whole meeting just deflates and those people just they drain energy from the meeting and you have to decide which of those kinds of people you're gonna be are you gonna add energy and the same thing at home and the same thing at home and it's so it's a wheel it's a cycle it's a flywheel it's a circle it's not a balance because of balance that's why that metaphor is so dangerous because it implies there's a strict trade-off and you could be out of work have all the time for your family in the world but really depressed and demoralized about your work situation and your family wouldn't want to be anywhere near you they would wish you would take a vacation from them and so it's not about the number of hours not primarily I suppose if you went crazy with you know 100 hours a week or something yeah that maybe maybe there are limits and they probably but I've never had a problem and I think it's because both sides of my life give me energy and that's what I would recommend it's what I do recommend to interns and execs so we're out of time I just want to say that you know first of all thank you all for joining us around the proverbial fire pit it's it's it's not lost on me that I'm incredibly it brings me joy to have the opportunity to have conversations like this with you often and I do cherish those opportunities and there's just one more so thank you very much thank all of you I guess there's just one more thing to say we should toast yep to adventure fellowship [Applause] you"

      "transcript": "- Jeff, welcome to Berlin. - Thanks, it's great to be here. - I have to tell you when we were sitting in the first row just a couple of minutes ago when the heartbeat was there Jeff looked at me and I was breathing in and out and he looked at me and asked, \"Matias are you nervous?\" I said, \"Yes, I'm always nervous on occasions like that.\" And he said, \"So am I.\" I said, \"Really? \"The richest man in the world is nervous \"because he receives the Axel Springer Award?\" So be a bit forgiving, we are both nervous. Jeff, we are so glad to really celebrate you tonight. Most importantly apart from all the reasons that we heard because you are a role model for other young founders, entrepreneurs who really have great ideas, crazy ideas, unconventional ideas and need encouragement to simply do it and go for it and you have shown that to the world. So that is really, for me, the most important thing and in that context the first question, you used to work in New York as an investment banker. So an investment banker is actually the exact opposite of an entrepreneur, he's delegating risk to other people and basically, how did you find out or how did you think that you should move from investment banking to really launch a company? - I think I'd always wanted to do it even since I was a kid, had the idea, every time I look at something, it looks like it could be improved, there's something wrong with it so I go through it like how could this restaurant be better, so I've always had that kind of idea. By the way, before we really get into this, how about this amazing production that you and your team have put together? This is truly incredible for it's originality like these boxes that you were filming live that's just crazy cool so thank you. (audience applause) Truly it's incredible. But I think the great thing about humans in general is we're always improving things. And so entrepreneurs and inventors, they follow their curiosity and they follow their passions and they figure something out and then they figure out how to make it better and they're never satisfied. And you need to harness, in my view, you need to harness that energy primarily on your customers instead of on your competitors. And so I sometimes see companies and even young small start up companies, entrepreneurs, go awry is they start to pay attention to their competition than they do to their customers. And I think that in big mature industries that might be a winning approach in some cases, kind of close following, let other people be the pioneers and go down the blind allies, there are so many things that a new, inventive company tries won't work and so those mistakes and errors and failures do cost real money. And so maybe in a mature industry where growth rates are slow and change is very slow. But as you see in the world more and more, there aren't very many mature industries, change is happening everywhere. You see it in the automobile industry with self driving cars but you could go right down the line of every industry and you would see it. - Do you have any idea where your ambition really comes from? What was driving you? - I really don't know. I've been passionate about certain things forever and I fell in love with computers in fourth grade. I got very lucky. My elementary school had a teletype that got connected to a mainframe computer that some business in downtown Houston donated a little bit of computer time too. This is, you can picture these teletypes, they had the punch tape and they had a 300 bot modem, you would dial up the phone, you'd put it in the cradle. And so we had some time sharing on that mainframe computer and none of the teachers knew how to use it so me and two other kids stayed after school and sort of figured out how to do it, figured it out and kind of taught ourselves programming from books. I think one thing that is, I got very lucky early in my childhood. Look, we all get gifts, we get certain things in our life that we're very lucky about and one of the most powerful ones is who your early role models are. - [Matias] It was your grandfather. - It was in a big sense. My mom and dad but my grandfather too. My mom had me when she was 17 years old and she was still in high school in Albuquerque, New Mexico and this is in 1964. I can assure you that being a pregnant teenager in high school was not cool in Albuquerque, New Mexico at that time. So it was difficult for her. My grandfather went to bat for her, they tried to kick her out of school, they're incredible. So the gift I had is I had this incredible family. - Could you describe a little bit the role of your grandfather? Because John has mentioned it and I think it was really important. - It was super important for me and I spent an unusual amount of time with my grandparents, especially with my grandfather on the ranch. So he had a ranch in south Texas and I would spend my summers there from age four to 16. And when I was four, they were taking me for the summer to kind of give my parents a break 'cause they were so young and it was useful. I was a handful I'm sure. Anyway, he created the illusion for me when I was four years old that I was helping him on the ranch which of course could not have been true but I believed it and then by the time I was 16 of course I was actually helping on the ranch. I can fix prolapsed cattle, we did all of our own veterinary work. Some of the cattle even survived. And we fixed windmills and laid water pipelines and built fences and barns and fixed the bulldozer that you guys talked about and so one of the things that's so interesting about that lifestyle and about my grandfather is he did everything himself. He didn't call a vet if one of the animals was sick, he figured out what to do himself. - So what does it mean, no delegation? - Being resourceful, I think is the, if there's a problem, there's a solution and of course as you mature and get into the business world and anything you do on a team, you very quickly realize that it's not about just your own resourcefulness, it's about team resourcefulness and how does that work. But that attitude of my grandfather's was very, but he was full of wisdom. John mentioned the story about the words my grandfather gave to me at one point of it's harder to be kind than clever. That story, the slightly longer version of that story, 'cause this was really powerful wisdom is that I made my grandmother burst into tears and the way I did it was we were driving on a long road trip and she was a chain smoker and this was, I was probably, I don't know 10 years old so this was around 1974 and it was in a period of time where there were heavy radio advertisements sort of anti smoking radio advertisements trying to convince people to stop smoking. And one of the advertisements had this figure in it that said something like, every puff of a cigarette takes so many minute off of your life, I think it was two minutes but I can't remember. So I sat there in the backseat on this long car ride and calculated how many years she had taken off of her life and in my 10 year old mind, I had been extremely clever to do this. And so when I was finished with my arithmetic, I proudly announced to her how many years she had taken off of her life and I got a reaction I did not expect with her bursting into tears. So my grandfather stopped the car and he took me out of the car and I had no idea what was about to happen because he had never said a cross word to me and I thought, he might actually be angry with me but he wasn't. He took me out so we had some privacy from her and he said these incredible words, he said, \"You're gonna figure out one day \"that it's harder to be kind than clever.\" - Wonderful. Actually, your brother also plays an important role, you have a very good relationship. Is it actually true that he's still a firefighter? - He is, he's a volunteer firefighter in Scarsdale, New York. He's also the funniest person I know. When I'm with him, I'm just laughing continuously. First of all, I'm a good audience. I laugh easily but he is really very funny and my sister too, we're all very close and I have my mother to thank for that because she worked hard to make sure as we grew up that we stayed close together and she takes all the grandkids for one week every summer so that me and my sister and our spouses can go on a trip together. So we end up spending a lot of time together. - For me the most moving image that we saw tonight is the one that John showed where you and Mackenzie are preparing the table, the famous table which is very moving because it shows how you really started from the very scratch and also it illustrates symbolically that the launch of Amazon was really something that you did together. Could you describe a little bit what Mackenzie's role was? - Well first of all, Mackenzie, she had married this stable guy working on Wall Street and a year after we got married, I went to her and said, \"I want to quit my job, move across the country \"and start this internet bookstore.\" And Mackenzie of course like everybody that I explained this to her first question was, what's the internet? Because nobody knew, this is 1994. But even before she could say what's the internet she said, \"Great, let's go.\" Because she wanted to support it and she knew that I had always had this passion for invention and starting a company. And so again, I think, Mackenzie is an example of this but I was talking about with my mom and my dad, who's a Cuban immigrant, and you have, he came to the US when he was 16 and refugee camp in the Everglades, they are so loving and supportive that when you have loving and supportive people in your life like Mackenzie, my parents, my grandfather, my grandmother, you end up being able to take risk because I think it's one of those things, it doesn't, you kind of know somebody's got your back and so it's just an, I don't even think you're thinking about it logically, it's emotional thing. - That's really interesting, you think that unconditional love, if you feel and experience unconditional love, it helps you to take risk? - And by the way, I think it's probably true of all kinds of risks in life, not just starting a business. Life is full of different risks. So I think that when you think about the things that you will regret when you're 80, they are almost always the things that you did not do, they are acts of omission. Very rarely are you gonna regret something that you did and it failed and didn't work or whatever but the acts of omission, and again, I'm not just talking about business things, it's like, I loved that person and I never told them and 50 years later you're gonna be like, why didn't I tell her, why didn't I go after it? So that's the kind of life regret that is very hard to be happy about when you're telling yourself in a private moment that story of your life. So I think it's, anyway, I won that lottery, I won that lottery of having so many people in my life who have given me that unconditional love and I do think Mackenzie's definitely one of those. And so we moved and then Mackenzie, who has basically no skill in this area at all, really, I mean you're the least suited person for this, she did our accounting for like the first year, was it the first year? Something like that. And she did it well, that's what's amazing. My wife is a novelist, she's won the American Book Award, Toni Morrison, the Nobel prize winning author who was Mackenzie's teacher at Princeton said on the Charlie Rose Show that Mackenzie, Toni Morrison, the Nobel prize winner said about Mackenzie that Mackenzie was her best student ever. Anyways, Mackenzie is a very talented novelist but she is not an accountant but she pulled it off. Again, we all get done what we need to get done. - Did she then suggest that you focus on book business at the beginning being an author? - No, I picked books, it is true, she's a big reader, I'm a big reader but that's not why I picked books. I picked books because there were more items in the book category than any other category and so you could build universal selection. There were three million in 1994 when I was pulling this idea together, three million different books active in print at any given time and the largest physical bookstores only had about 150,000 different titles. And so I could see how you could make a bookstore online with universal selection, every book ever printed, even the out of print ones was the original vision for the company and so that's why books. - And when did you know that Amazon is going to be something way bigger than just a bookstore? - Well, I knew that the books, strangely, 'cause I was very prepared for this to take a really long time, I knew that the books business was gonna be successful in the first 30 days. I was shocked at how many books we sold. We were ill prepared. We had only 10 people in the company at that time and most of them were software engineers. So everybody including me and the softwares were all packing boxes, we didn't even have packing tables and we were on our hands and knees on a concrete floor packing the boxes and at about one or two in the morning I said to one of my software engineering colleagues, I said, \"Paul, this is killing my knees, \"we need to get knee pads.\" And Paul looked at me and he's like, \"Jeff, we need to get packing tables.\" And I was like, \"Oh my God, that is such a good idea.\" The next day I bought packing tables and it doubled our productivity and probably saved our backs and our knees too. - But nevertheless, Amazon had serious crises. In 2002, you went almost bankrupt. So what went wrong and what did you learn from that? - We had so many, there've been so many, I haven't had any existential crises, knock on wood, I don't want to jinx anything but we've had a lot of kind of dramatic events. I remember early on, we only had 125 employees when Barnes and Noble, the big United States bookseller opened their online website to compete against us, barnesandnoble.com. We'd had about a two year window. We opened in '95, they opened in '97 and at that time, all of the headlines and the funniest were about how we were about to be destroyed by this much larger company, we had 125 employees and $60 million a year in annual sales, $60 million with an m and Barnes and Noble at the time had 30,000 employees and about three billion dollars in sales. So they were giant, we were tiny and we had limited resources and the headlines were very negative about Amazon and the one that's most memorable was just amazon.toast and so I called an all hands meeting which was not hard to do with just 125 people and we got in a room 'cause it was so scary for all of us, this idea that now we finally had a big competitor that literally everybody's parents were calling and saying, \"Are you okay?\" It was usually the moms calling and asking their children, are you gonna be okay? And I said, \"Look, it's okay to be afraid \"but don't be afraid of our competitors \"because they're never gonna send us any money, \"be afraid of our customers. \"And if we just stay focused on them \"instead of obsessing over this big competitor \"that we just got, we'll be fine.\" And I really do believe that. I think that if you stay focused and the more drama there is and everything else, no matter what the drama is, whatever the external distraction is, your response to it should be to double down on the customer, satisfying them, not just satisfying them, delighting them. - Today Amazon is employing 566,000 people. You're probably the biggest job creator of recent times. At the same time, you're aggressively criticized by unions and by media for paying low wages, for inappropriate working conditions. How do you deal with these accusations? - Well, first of all, when any criticism, my approach to criticism and what I teach and preach inside Amazon is when you're criticized, first look in a mirror and decide are your critics right? If they're right, change, don't resist. - Are they right? - No, not in this case but we've had critics be right before and we've changed. We have made mistakes and I can go through a long list of, probably one of the early most painful ones is it's so stupid it's hard to believe how we ever did it but in the early on with the kindle maybe the first year of the kindle or the second year of the kindle, we had accidentally illegally sold or given away I guess, copies of the famous novel 1984 because it had a complicated copyright history, it was in copyright in the US and not in the UK or something strange like this so it was in the public domain but only in certain geographies and we had screwed that up and somehow, and this is the kind of mistake that only a corporation can make, an individual can't make this mistake because somehow it happens at the intersections of the different teams. So you've got the legal department saying, \"Oh crap, we've made this mistake\" and you've got the books team. Anyway, the answer that the company came up with was to without any notice or warning just electronically go into everybody's kindle who had downloaded that book and just disappear it. So it would be as if we walked into your bedroom in the middle of the night found your bookshelf and just took that book away. And so we were rightly criticized for that and we responded to that. On the issue of working conditions, I'm very proud of our working conditions and I'm very proud of the wages that we pay. In Germany, we employ 16,000 people, we pay at the high end of the range for any comparable work. - Will the union fight because the union want to make sure that you are unionized or what is the real substance of the conflict? - Well, it's a good question and this is in my longer version of how to deal with critics, there are two kinds of critics, there are well meaning critics who, they're worried it's not gonna work but they do want it to work so I could give you an example of customer reviews would be one of those. When we first did customer reviews 20 years ago, some book publishers were not happy about it because some of them were negative and so it was a very controversial practice at that time but we thought it was right and so we stuck to our guns and had a deep keel on that and didn't change. But there's a second kind of critic which is the self interested critic and they come in all shapes and sizes. So they can be any kind of institution, competitors, of course, and so when you are doing something in a new way and if customers embrace the new way, what's gonna happen is incumbents who are practicing the older way are not gonna like you and they're gonna be self interested critics. And so you do need as you're looking yourself in the mirror to try and tease those two things apart. In our view, we have workers counsels of course and we have very good communications with our employees. So we don't believe that we need a union to be an intermediary between us and our employees but of course at the end of the day, it's always the employees choice and that's how it should be. But for sure, we would be very naive to believe that we're not gonna be criticized. That's just part of the terrain, you have to accept that. One other thing I tell people is if you're gonna do anything new or innovative, you have to be willing to be misunderstood. If you can't afford to be misunderstood, then for goodness sake, don't do anything new or innovative. - Maggie Thatcher said, \"Leadership is not to be pleased by the moment.\" But your most prominent critic at the moment is the president of the United States. People are even saying that he may be willing to prepare initiatives to break up Amazon because it's too big, it's too successful, it's too dominant in too many sectors or for other reasons. First of all, is this scenario of a break of something that you take seriously or you think it's just a fantasy? - For me, again, this is one of those things where I focus on and ask our teams to focus on what we can control and I expect, whether it's the current US administration or any other government agency anywhere in the world Amazon is now a large corporation and I expect us to be scrutinized, we should be scrutinized, I think all large institutions should be scrutinized and examined, it's reasonable. One thing to note about us is that we have gotten big in absolute terms only very recently. So we've always been growing fast in percentage terms but in 2010 just eight years ago, we had 30,000 employees. So in the last eight years we've gone from 30,000 employees to 560,000 employees. So for us, it's kind of, in my mind, I'm still delivering the packages to the post office myself, you see what I'm saying? I still have all the memories of hoping that one day we could afford a forklift. And so obviously that's my intellectual brain knows that's just not the case anymore, we have 560,000 employees all over the world and I know we should be scrutinized and I think it's true of big government institutions should be scrutinized, big non profit institutions should be scrutinized, big universities should be scrutinized, it just makes sense. And that's by the way, why the work that the Washington Post and the other great newspapers around the world do is so important because they're often the ones doing that initial scrutiny even before the government agencies do. - But in a way, the general sentiment towards the big innovative tech companies has changed. Facebook, Google, Apple, Amazon, they used to be seen as the nice guys in tee shirts that are saving the world and now they are sometimes portrayed as the kind of evil of the world. And the debate about the big four or the big five, The Economist is suggesting a split up, other powerful people like Josh Soros are giving speeches in Davos, the EU Commission is taking pretty a tough positions here. Do you think that there is a change in mindset in the society? And what should the big tech companies, what should Amazon learn from that or do with that? - I do sense, I think again, I think it's a natural instinct. I think we humans, especially in the Western world and especially inside democracies are wired to be skeptical and mindful of large institutions of any kind. We're skeptical of our government always in the United States, state governments, local governments, I assume it's similar in Germany, it's healthy because they're big powerful institutions, the police, the military, whatever it is, it doesn't mean that you don't trust them or that they're bad or evil or anything like that, they're just, they have a lot of power and control and so you want to inspect them, maybe that's a better word, you kind of always want to be inspecting them. And I think if you look at the big tech companies they have gotten large enough that they're going to be inspected. And by the way, it's not personal. I think where some of the, you can go astray on this if you're the founder of a company, one of these big tech companies or any other big institution, if you go astray on this you might start to take it personally, like why are you inspecting me? And I think that, I wish that people would just say, \"Yes, it's fine.\" - The whole attitude towards data protection and privacy has always been different between Europe and the United States but is also at the moment in the context of Cambridge Analytica changing in the United States. What are the consequences for a company like Amazon? - My view on this for Amazon-- - Is it hysterical or is it inappropriate-- - Honestly, I think this is one of the great questions of our age. I think of the internet, so the internet is this big new powerful technology, it's horizontal, it affects every industry and then if you think of even more broadly tech and machine learning and big data and all these kinds of things, these are big horizontal powerful technologies and in my view, so we've been at scale. The internet is quite old at this point, it's been around a long time but at scale, it's really only been around 10 or 15 years, 'cause go back in time 20 years, it was tiny. And so at scale, the internet's been around only 10 or 15 years and we haven't learned as a civilization, as a human species, we haven't learned how to operate it yet. So we're still, we as a civilization are still figuring that out. And so it has fantastic, gives us fantastic capabilities. The fact that I can look up almost anything on Wikipedia in five seconds is an unbelievable capability that just simply didn't exist 20 years ago and so on and so on and so on, there's so many good things but we're also finding out that these powerful tools enable some very bad things too like letting authoritarian governments interfere in free democratic elections around the world. It's incredibly scary thing. - So you're advocating a balance of let's say entrepreneurs who are really moving their businesses forward, politicians and regulators who are finding a certain framework, a society, journalists who are asking unpleasant questions? - So my view on Amazon's role in this which is what you asked me is I think first of all, we have a duty on behalf of society to try and help educate any regulators, give them our point of view on this sincerely without any cynicism or skepticism, this is what we believe, but it's not ultimately our decision. So we will work with any set of regulations that we're given. Ultimately society decides that, we will follow those rules regardless of the impact they have on our business and we will find a new way if need be to delight customers. So we will always be, again, some of these things, what you have to worry about is the problem, what I would not want to see happen is that you don't want to block invention and innovation. So that's always one of the things, one of the unintended consequences often of regulation is that it really favors the incumbents. Now Amazon at this point is an incumbent so maybe I should be happy about that but I wouldn't be because I think for society you really want to see continued progress. So to the degree that we have regulation, you want to be sure that it is incenting innovation and not blocking it while at the same time protecting. But data security, privacy, encryption, how do you safeguard people's physical safety against terrorists and bad actors all over the world and how do you balance that against privacy? These are very challenging questions. - We are running out of time but I have a couple of-- - We're not gonna answer them in even a few years. I think it's gonna be an ongoing thing. - But data security and privacy is going to be a competitive advantage for companies or disadvantage if their not respectful with that? - I 100% agree with this and I think with customers, one of the reasons we have been able to extend into new business areas and new product categories, going way back, we just sold books and then we started selling music and DVDs and electronics and toys and so on and then we've extended into electronic reading with kindle. The reason customers have been receptive in large part to our new initiatives is because we have worked hard to earn trust with them. Earning trust with customers is a valuable business asset and if you mistreat their data, they will know, they will figure it out. Customers are very smart, you should never underestimate customers. - People are getting hungry but I have some brief questions left. You are preparing a second headquarter, it's going to be in the US. Why didn't you consider to do it in Europe? - I wanted it in a time zone either in, we looked at Canada, US and Mexico-- - So it's not an anti Europe decision, it's for practical reasons. - It's not an anti Europe decision. - I'm glad to hear that. When you bought the Post, there were people saying well that's just a personal toy, he wants to have some political influence. Other people thought that is a new strategic element of Jeff's strategy. So what was it? - Yeah, of course, you can explain things to people but you can't understand things to people. And so all I can do is say what really my thought process was. And I was not looking to buy a newspaper. It had never even crossed my mind and so when the opportunity came up, it had only came up because I had known Don Graham at that point for more than 15 years. Any of you who are lucky enough to know Don, knows that he is the most honorable gentleman that you'll ever meet, you know Don very well, he's a remarkable guy and he so loved The Post that he believed, even though this was a huge personal sacrifice for him because it had been in his family for so long, that he needed to find a new home for it. I think he was, there were certain purchasers he was hoping would not end up buying The Post because he wanted it to remain independent. So when he approached me with this I said, \"I'm the wrong guy \"because I don't know \"anything about the newspaper business.\" And he said, \"That's okay \"'cause we have a lot of people at The Post \"who know a lot about the newspaper business \"and what we really need \"is somebody who knows something more about the internet.\" And The Post was in very difficult financial position at that time and so for me, I had to decide was it hopeless? And I didn't believe it was hopeless, I was optimistic that The Post could be turned around. And then second, I had to decide did I want to put my own time and energy into this? And that for me I just had to ask the simple question is it an important institution? And the answer to that question is yes, it was very obvious to me, as soon as I thought that way. I was like, okay, I think I actually can help, I can help in two ways. I can provide financial resources while this turnaround occurs and I can also help with my internet knowledge. And then is it an institution worth saving? You bet. It's the most important newspaper in the most important capital city in the Western world. Crazy not to save that newspaper. I'm gonna be very happy when I'm 80 that I made that decision. (audience applause) - I assume that you have seen Steven Spielberg's film The Post? - I have, yeah, I've seen it a couple of times. - So what is the lesson that you learned from that and could you imagine also to buy and save other newspapers? - No, I get that request monthly, I really do and I tell them, no, The Post is it for me, I'm not interested in buying other newspapers. But I watched that movie and it's helpful, I love that movie and also reading Katherine Graham's memoir which won a Pulitzer Prize and is an amazing book because it gets me ready. As the owner of The Post, I know that at times The Post is gonna write stories, they're gonna make very powerful people very unhappy. - Are you upset if they are writing critical stories about Amazon, which they do? - No, I'm not upset at all. - Did you call and interfere? - Never, I would be humiliated to interfere. I would be so embarrassed. I would turn bright red and it's nothing to do with, I don't even get so far, I just don't want to. For me, it would feel icky, it would feel gross. It would be one of those things when I'm 80 years old I would be so unhappy with myself if I interfered. Why would I? I want that paper to be independent. So we have a fantastic editor in Marty Baron, we have a fantastic publisher in Fred Ryan, the head of our technology team a guy named Shilesh is fantastic. They don't need my help in the newsroom for sure. First of all, that's also an expert's job. It would be like me getting on the airplane and going up to the front of the plane and saying the pilots should move aside, let me do this. - You are not getting on the airplane but you are sending workers to the space. - That's the best segway ever by the way. - Could you share with us briefly the vision of Blue Origin and the idea of kind of space tourism with renewable rockets? - This is super important to me. I believe on the longest time frame and really here I'm thinking of a time frame of a couple hundred years, so over many decades, I believe and I get increasing conviction with this with every passing year, that Blue Origin, the space company, is the most important work I'm doing. And so there is a whole plan for Blue Origin. - Really? So you'd say retail, online ecommerce, publishing, that's all less relevant than the space project? - Yes and I'll tell you why. First of all, of course, I'm interested in space because I'm passionate about it and I've been studying it and thinking about it since I was a five year old boy but that is not why I'm pursuing this work. I'm pursuing this work because I believe if we don't, we will eventually end up with a civilization of stasis which I find very demoralizing. I don't want my great grandchilren's great grandchildren to lie in a civilization of stasis. We all enjoy a dynamic civilization of growth and change and let's think about what powers that. We are not really energy constrained. And so let me give you just a couple of numbers. If you take your body, your metabolic rate as a human as just an animal, you eat food, that's your metabolism, you burn about 100 watts, your power, your body is about 100, it's the same as the 100 watt light bulb, we're incredibly efficient. Your brain is about 60 watts of that, amazing. But if you extrapolate in developed countries where we use a lot of energy, on average in developed countries, our civilizational metabolic rate is 11,000 watts. So in a natural state where we're animals we're only using 100 watts. In our actual developed world state, we're using 11,000 watts and it's growing. For a century or more, it's been compounding at a few percent a year, our energy usage as a civilization. Now if you take baseline energy usage, globally across the whole world, and compound it at just a few percent a year for just a few hundred years, you have to cover the entire surface of the Earth in solar cells. So that's the real energy crisis and it's happening soon and by soon, I mean within just a few hundred years. And so we don't actually have that much time. So what can you do? Well, you can have a life of stasis where you cap how much energy we get to use, you have to work only on efficiency, by the way, we've always been working on energy efficiency and still we grow our energy usage. It's not like we have been squandering energy, we have been getting better at using it with every passing decade and still we grow it. So stasis would be very bad I think. Now take the alternative scenario where you move out into the solar system. The solar system can easily support a trillion humans and if we had a trillion humans we would have 1,000 Einsteins and 1,000 Mozarts and unlimited for all practical purposes resources from solar power and so on. Why not, that's the world that I want my great grandchildren's great grandchildren to live in. And by the way, I believe, that we'll move all heavy, in that time frame, we will move all heavy industry off of Earth and Earth will be zoned residential and light industry and it will basically be a very beautiful planet. We have sent robotic probes to every planet in this solar system now and believe me, this is the best one. It is not even close. - But Jeff, when can I buy the first ticket to do a little space tour? - So the first tourism vehicle, we won't be selling tickets yet but we may put humans in it at the end of this year or at the beginning of next year. We're getting very close. We've been working on it for more than 10 years and we're building a very large orbital vehicle, we've been working on that for more than five years. It'll fly for the first time in 2020 and the key is reusability. So you mentioned it. We cannot, this civilization I'm talking about of getting comfortable living and working in space and having millions of people and then billions of people and then finally a trillion people in space you can't do that with space vehicles that you use once and then throw away. It's a ridiculous costly way to get into space. - The most recent thing that Amazon is planning is home robots. So I assume it's more than Alexa walking. So what's the vision behind it? - I saw that rumor in the press and I can't comment on that. - I see, so it seems to be very serious. Jeff, you are one of the most long term thinking entrepreneurs. If it is about companies and products and services, if it is about philanthropy, you recently said that you are a very short term thinker, you really want to deal with the now and here. Can you explain that approach? I think that's also very innovative. - And I'm gonna end up doing a mixture of things. We started doing in Seattle there's a homeless shelter called Mary's Place run by a woman named Marty and that has really impacted my thinking on this issue because what I'm seeing is that when you, of course I'm in favor of all the, long term oriented philanthropy also is a good idea. So I'm not against that. It's just I'm finding I'm very motivated by the here and now there. A lot of the homelessness at Mary's Place works on is transient homelessness. So when you go study homelessness, there are a bunch of causes of homelessness. Mental incapacity issues are a very hard to cure problem, serious drug addiction, a very hard to cure problem, but there's another bucket of homelessness which is transient homelessness which is a woman with kids, the father runs away and he was the only person providing any income and they have no support system, they have no family. That's transient homelessness. You can really help that person. And you by the way, only need to help them for like six to nine months, you get them trained, you get them a job, they're perfectly productive members of society. - Last week we had Bill Gates for dinner here and he said that he has a ridiculous amount of money and it's so hard to find appropriate ways to do good with the money. So what does money mean for you being the first person in history that has a net worth of three digit amount of billion? - The only way that I can see to deploy this much financial resource is by converting my Amazon winnings into space travel. So that's basically, Blue Origin is expensive enough to be able to use that fortune and I'm currently liquidating about a billion dollars a year of Amazon's stock to fund Blue Origin and I plan to continue to do that for a long time. 'Cause you're right, you're not gonna spend it on a second dinner out. That's not what we're talking about. So for me, I'm very lucky because I feel like I have a mission driven purpose with Blue Origin that is I think incredibly important for civilization long term and I am gonna use my financial lottery winnings from Amazon to fund that. - With regard to your personal lifestyle, there are no guilty pleasures that you are doing unreasonable things? - Well, I don't think they're that guilty. I have lots of pleasures and we just came back from an amazing trip with the kids, Mackenzie and I did, she planned the whole thing, it was her birthday trip but she planned it all. We went to Norway for three days and we stayed in an ice hotel, we went dog sledding, we went to a wolf preserve and actually got to interact with these timber wolves. It was really an incredible vacation, an incredible holiday and we got it all done in three and a half days. So it was amazing. - Wonderful. Jeff, John mentioned, it's the last question, John mentioned that you are an ideal family man, your kids are extremely important, you just mentioned that when we spoke earlier. If we would talk to your kids, where would they criticize their dad? - They would make fun of my singing. - Okay, can we get a? - No, God no. They would make fun of my inability to remember exact words. I'm always quoting Churchill or something and getting it wrong and they're like, \"That's not even close \"to what Churchill said.\" They would probably, depending on the moment, they might criticize my laugh. They're kids. I'm lucky, I have a very good relationship with them, this work life harmony thing is what I try to teach young employees, actually, and senior executive at Amazon too but especially the people coming in. We're asked about work life balance all the time and my view is that's a debilitating phrase because it implies there's a strict trade off and the reality is if I'm happy at home, I come into the office with tremendous energy and if I'm happy at work, I come home with tremendous energy. And so it actually is a circle, it's not a balance. And I think that that is worth everybody paying attention to. You never want to be that guy and we all know, we all have a coworker, who is that person who as soon as they come into the meeting they drain all of the energy out of the room. You can just feel the energy level go whoof, you don't want to be that guy. So you want to come into the office and give everybody a kick in their step. - Jeff, thank you very much. We congratulate you for all you have achieved and congratulations. - Very nice, thank you."

      "transcript": "- The following is a conversation with Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon and Blue Origin. This is his first time doing a conversation of this kind and of this length. And as he told me, it felt like we could have easily talked for many more hours, and I'm sure we will. This is the Lex Fridman podcast. And now, dear friends, here's Jeff Bezos. You spent a lot of your childhood with your grandfather on a ranch here in Texas, and I heard you had a lot of work to do around the ranch. So what's the coolest job you remember doing there? - Wow, coolest. - Most interesting. Most memorable. - Most memorable. Most impactful. - And it was a real working ranch. My grand, I spent all my summers on that ranch from age four to 16. And my grandfather was really taking me to those in the summers, in the early summers, he was letting me pretend to help on the ranch. 'Cause of course, a 4-year-old is a burden, not a help in real life. He was really just watching me and taking care of me and be was doing that because my mom was so young. She had me when she was 17, and so he was sort of giving her a break. And my grandmother and my grandfather would take me for these summers. But as I got a little older, I actually was helpful on the ranch and I loved it. I was out there, like my grandfather had a huge influence on me, huge factor in my life. I did all the jobs you would do on a ranch. I've fixed windmills and laid fences and pipelines and you know, done all the things that any rancher would do, vaccinated, the animals, everything. But we had a you know, my grandfather, after my grandmother died, I was about 12 and I kept coming to the ranch. So it was then, it was just him and me, just the two of us. And he was completely addicted to the soap opera, the Days of Our Lives. And we would go back to the ranch house every day around 1:00 PM or so to watch days of our lives like sands through an hourglass. So are the days of our lives. - Just the image of the two sitting there watching a soap opera as ranchers. - He had these big, crazy dogs. It was really a very formative experience for me. But the key thing about it for me, the great gift I got from it was that my grandfather was so resourceful, you know, he did everything himself. He made his own veterinary tools. He would make needles to suture the cattle up with, like he would find a little piece of wire and heat it up and pound it thin and drill a hole in it and sharpen it. So, you know, you learn different things on a ranch than you would learn you know, growing up in a city. - So self-reliance. - Yeah, like figuring out that you can solve problems with enough persistence and ingenuity. And my grandfather bought a D6 bulldozer, which is a big bulldozer, and he got it for like $5,000. 'cause it was completely broken down. It was like a 1955 Caterpillar, D6 bulldozer knew it would've cost, I don't know, more than a $100,000. And we spent an entire summer fixing, like repairing that bulldozer. And we'd, you know, use mail order to buy big gears for the transmission. And they'd show up. They'd be too heavy to move, so we'd have to build a crane, you know, just that kind of, kinda that problem solving mentality. He had it so powerfully, you know, he did all of his own. He'd just, he didn't pick up the phone and call somebody. He would figure it out on his own. Doing his own veterinary work, you know. - But just the image of the two of you fixing a D6 bulldozer and then going in for a little break at 1:00 PM to watch a soap opera. - Laying on the floor. That's how he watched TV. - Yeah. - He was a really, really remarkable guy. - That's how I imagine Clint Eastwood also in all those westerns. When he's not doing what he is doing, he's just watching soap operas. All right, I read that you fell in love with the idea of space and space exploration when you were five watching Neil Armstrong walking on the moon. So let me ask you to look back at the historical context and impact of that. So the space race from 1957 to 1969 between the Soviet Union and the US was in many ways epic. It was a rapid sequence of dramatic events for satellite to space, for a human to space, for a spacewalk, first uncrewed landing on the moon, then some failures, explosions, deaths on both sides actually, and then the first human walking on the moon. What are some of the more inspiring moments or insights you take away from that time, those few years, that just 12 years? - Well, I mean, there's so much inspiring there. You know, one of the great things to take away from that, one of the great von Braun quotes is \"I have come to use the word impossible with great caution.\" - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - And so that's kind of the big story of Apollo is that things, you know, going to the moon was literally an analogy that people used for something that's impossible. You know, oh yeah, you'll do that when you know, men walk on the moon. - Yeah. - And of course it finally happened. So, you know, I think it was pulled forward in time because of the space race, I think you know, with the geopolitical implications and you know, how much resource was put into it, you know, at the peak, that program was spending, you know, two or 3% of GDP on the Apollo program. So much resource. I think it was pulled forward in time. You know, we kind of did it ahead of when we quote unquote should have done it. - Yeah. - And so in that way, it's also a technical marvel. I mean, it's truly incredible. It's, you know, it's the 20th century version of building the pyramids or something. It's you know, it's an achievement that because it was pulled forward in time and because it did something that had previously thought impossible, it rightly deserves its place, as you know, in the pantheon of great human achievements. - And of course, you named the projects The Rockets that Blue Origin is working on after some of the folks involved. - Yeah. - I don't understand why I didn't say New Gagarin. is that- - There's an American bias in the naming. I apologize. - It's very strange. - Lex. - Just asking for a friend. Clarify. - I'm a big fan of Gagarin though. And in fact, I think his first words in space, I think are incredible. He, you know, he purportedly said \"my God, it's blue.\" And that really drives home. No one had seen the earth from space. No one knew that we were on this blue planet. - Yeah. - No one knew what it looked like from out there. And Gagarin was the first person to see it. - One of the things I think about is how dangerous those early days were for Gagarin, for Glen, for everybody involved. Like how big of a risk they were all taking. - They were taking huge risks. I'm not sure what the Soviets thought about Gagarin's flight, but I think that the Americans thought that the Alan Shephard flight, the flight that you know, New Shephard is named after, the first American in space. He went on his suborbital flight. They thought he had about a 75% chance of success. So, you know, that's a pretty big risk, a 25% risk. - It's kind of interesting that Alan Shephard is not quite as famous as John Glenn. So for people who don't know, Alan Shephard is the first astronaut- - The first American in space. - American in suborbital flight. - Correct. - And then the first orbital flight is- - John Glenn is the first American to orbit the earth. By the way, I have the most charming, sweet, incredible letter from John Glenn, which I have framed and hang on my office wall. - What did he say? - Where he tells me how grateful he is that we have named New Glenn after him. And he sent me that letter about a week before he died. And it's really an incredible, it's also a very funny letter. He's writing and he says you know, this is a letter about New Glenn from the original Glenn. And he's just, he's got a great sense of humor, and he's very happy about it and grateful. It's very sweet. - Does he say ps don't mess this up? Or is that- - No, he doesn't. - Make me look good. - He doesn't do that. - Okay. - But wait, but John, wherever you are, we got you covered. - All right, good. So back to maybe the big picture of space. When you look up at the stars and think big, what do you hope is the future of humanity? Hundreds, thousands of years from now out in space? - I would love to see, you know, a trillion humans living in the solar system. If we had a trillion humans, we would have at any given time a thousand Mozarts and a thousand Einsteins. That would, you know, our solar system would be full of life and intelligence and energy. And we can easily support a civilization that large with all of the resources in the solar system. - So what do you think that looks like? Giant space stations? - Yeah, the only way to get to that vision is with giant space stations. You know, the planetary surfaces are just way too small. So you can, I mean, unless you turn them into giant space stations or something. But, but yeah, we will take materials from the moon and from near earth objects and from the asteroid belt and so on, and we'll build giant O'Neill style colonies and people will live in those. And they have a lot of advantages over planetary surfaces. You can spin them to get normal earth gravity. You can put them where you want them. I think most people are gonna wanna live near Earth, not necessarily in earth orbit, but in you know, earth, but near earth vicinity orbits. And so they can move you know, relatively quickly back and forth between their station and Earth. So I think a lot of people, especially in the early stages, are not gonna want to give up Earth altogether. - They go to earth for vacation. - Yeah. Same way that you know, you might go to Yellowstone National Park for vacation. People will, and no one, and people will get to choose where they live on earth or whether they live in space, but they'll be able to use much more energy and much more material resource in space than they would be able to use on earth. - One of the interesting ideas you had is to move the heavy industry away from Earth. So people sometimes have this idea that somehow space exploration is in conflict with the celebration of the planet earth, that we should focus on preserving earth. And basically your ideas that space travel and space exploration is a way to preserve earth. - Exactly. This planet, we've sent robotic probes to all the planets. We know that this is the good one. - Yeah. Not to play favorites or anything. - But earth really is the good planet. It's amazing, the ecosystem we have here, all of the life and the lush, the plant life and you know, the water resources, everything. This planet is really extraordinary. And of course, we evolved on this planet, so of course it's perfect for us, but it's also perfect for all the advanced life forms on this planet, all the animals and so on. And so this is a gem. We do need to take care of it. And as we enter the Anthropocene, as we get, as we humans have gotten so sophisticated and large and impactful, as we stride across this planet, you know, that is going to, as we continue, we want to use a lot of energy. We want to use a lot of energy per capita. We've gotten amazing things. We don't want to go backwards. You know, if you think about the good old days, they're mostly an illusion. Like in almost every way, life is better for almost everyone today than it was say, 50 years ago or a hundred years. We live better lives by and large than our grandparents did, and their grandparents did, and so on. And you can see that in global illiteracy rates, global poverty rates, global infant mortality rates, like almost any metric you choose, we're better off than we used to be. And we get, you know, antibiotics and all kinds of lifesaving medical care and so on and so on. And there's one thing that is moving backwards, and it's the natural world. So it is a fact that 500 years ago, pre-industrial age, the natural world was pristine. It was incredible. And we have traded some of that pristine beauty for all of these other gifts that we have as an advanced society. And we can have both. But to do that, we have to go to space. And all of this, really, the most fundamental measure is energy usage per capita. And when you look at, you know, you do want to continue to use more and more energy, it is going to make your life better in so many ways. But that's not compatible ultimately with living on a finite planet. And so we have to go out into the solar system and really you could argue about when you have to do that, but you can't credibly argue about whether you have to do that. - Eventually, we have to do that. - Exactly. - Well, you don't often talk about it, but let me ask you on that topic about the Blue Ring and the orbital reef space infrastructure projects. What's your vision for these? - So Blue Ring is a very interesting spacecraft that is designed to take up to 3000 kilograms of payload up to geosynchronous orbit or in lunar vicinity. It has two different kinds of propulsion. It has chemical propulsion, and it has electric propulsion. And so it can, you can use blue ring in a couple different ways. You can slowly move, let's say up to geosynchronous orbit using electric propulsion that might take you know, a hundred days or 150 days depending on how much mass you're carrying. And then, and reserve your chemical propulsion so that you can change orbits quickly in geosynchronous orbit. Or you can use the chemical propulsion first to quickly get up to geosynchronous and then use your electrical propulsion to slowly change your geosynchronous orbit. Blue Ring has a couple of interesting features. It provides a lot of services to these payloads. So the payload, it could be one large payload, or it can be a number of small payloads, and it provides thermal management, it provides electric power, it provides compute, provides communications. And so when you design a payload for Blue Ring, you don't have, you don't have to figure out all of those things on your own. So kind of radiation tolerant compute is a complicated thing to do. And so we have an unusually large amount of radiation tolerant compute on board Blue Ring, and you can, your payload can just use that when it needs to. So it's sort of all these services, it's you know, it's like a set of APIs. It's a little bit like Amazon web services, but for space payloads that need to move about an earth vicinity or lunar vicinity. - AWSS space. Okay, so computing space. So you get a giant chemical rocket to get a payload out to orbit, and then you have these admins that show up, this Blue Ring thing that manages various things like compute. - Exactly. And it can also provide transportation and move you around to different orbits. - Including humans, you think? - No, but Blue Ring is not designed to move humans around. It's designed to move payloads around. - Okay. - So we're also building a lunar lander, which is of course designed to land humans on the surface of the moon. - I'm gonna ask you about that, but let me ask you to just step back to the old days. You were at Princeton with aspirations to be a theoretical physicist. - Yeah. - What attracted you to physics and why did you change your mind and not become, why you're not Jeff Bezos, the famous theoretical physicist? - So I loved physics and I studied physics and computer science, and I was proceeding along the physics path. I was planning to major in physics and I wanted to be a theoretical physicist. And the computer science was sort of something I was doing for fun. I really loved it. And I was very good at the programming and doing those things. And I enjoyed all my computer science classes immensely, but I really was determined to be a theoretical physicist. It's why I went to Princeton in the first place. It was definitely, and then I realized I was gonna be a mediocre theoretical physicist. And there were a few people in my classes, like in quantum mechanics and so on, who they could effortlessly do things that were so difficult for me. And I realized like you know, there are a thousand ways to be smart and to be a really, you know, theoretical physics is not one of those fields where only the top few percent actually move the state of the art forward. It's one of those things where you have to be really just, your brain has to be wired in a certain way. And there was a guy named, one of these people who convinced me. He didn't mean to convince me, but just by observing him, he convinced me that I should not try to be a theoretical physicist. His name was Yosanta. And Yosanta was from Sri Lanka. And he was one of the most brilliant people I'd ever met. My friend Joe and I were working on a very difficult partial differential equations problem set one night. And there was one problem that we worked on for three hours, and we made no headway whatsoever. And we looked up at each other at the same time and we said, Yosanta. So we went to Yosanta's dorm room. And he was there, he was almost always there. And we said Yosanta, we're having trouble solving this partial differential equation, would you mind taking a look? And he said of course. By the way, he was the most humble, most kind person. And so he took our, he looked at our problem and he stared at it for just a few seconds, maybe 10 seconds. And he said cosine. And I said, what do you mean Yosanta? What do you mean cosine? He said that's the answer. And I said no, no, no, come on. And he said let me show you. And he took out some paper and he wrote down three pages of equations, everything canceled out. And the answer was cosine. And I said Yosanta, did you do that in your head? And he said oh no, that would be impossible. A few years ago I solved a similar problem and I could map this problem onto that problem. And then it was immediately obvious that the answer was cosine. I had a few, you know, you have an experience like that, you realize maybe being a theoretical physicist isn't what your, isn't what the universe wants you to be. And so I switched to computer science and you know, that worked out really well for me. I enjoy it. I still enjoy it today. - Yeah, there's a particular kind of intuition you need to be a great physicist, applied to physics. - I think the mathematical skill required today is so high. You have to be a world-class mathematician to be a successful theoretical physicist today. And it's not you know, you probably need other skills too, intuition, lateral thinking, and so on. But without just top-notch math skills, you're unlikely to be successful. - And visualization skill, you have to be able to really kind of do these kinds of thought experiments. And if you want truly great creativity, actually Walter Isaacson writes about you. It puts you on the same level as Einstein. - Well, that's very kind. I'm an inventor. If you wanna boil down what I am, I'm really an inventor. And I look at things and I can come up with atypical solutions and you know, and then I can create a hundred such atypical solutions for something. 99 of them may not survive, you know, scrutiny. But one of those 100 is like hmm, maybe there is, maybe that might work. And then you can keep going from there. So that kind of lateral thinking, that kind of inventiveness in a high dimensionality space where the search space is very large, that's where my inventive skills come. That's the thing is I self-identify as an inventor more than anything else. - Yeah, and he describes in all kinds of different ways, Walter Isaacson does that creativity combined with childlike wander that you've maintained still to this day, all of that combined together. Is there, like if you were to study your own brain introspect, how do you think, what's your thinking process like? We'll talk about the writing process of putting it down on paper, which is quite rigorous and famous at Amazon. But how do you, when you sit down, maybe alone, maybe with others, and thinking through this high dimensional space and looking for creative solutions, creative paths forward, is there something you could say about that process? - It's such a good question, and I honestly don't know how it works. If I did, I would try to explain it. I know it involves lots of wandering. - Yeah. - So I, you know, when I sit down to work on a problem, I know I don't know where I'm going. So to go in a straight line, to be efficient, efficiency and invention are sort of at odds because invention, real invention, not incremental improvement. Incremental improvement is so important in every endeavor, in everything you do. You have to work hard on also just making things a little bit better. But I'm talking about real invention, real lateral thinking, that requires wandering. And you have to give yourself permission to wander. I think a lot of people, they feel like wandering is inefficient. And you know, like when I sit down at a meeting, I don't know how long the meeting is gonna take if we're trying to solve a problem. Because if I did, then I'd already, I'd know there's some kind of straight line that we're drawing to the solution. The reality is we may have to wander for a long time. And I do like group invention. I think there's certainly nothing more fun than sitting at a whiteboard with you know, a group of smart people and spit balling and coming up with new ideas and objections to those ideas, and then solutions to the objections and going back and forth. So like you know, sometimes you wake up with an idea in the middle of the night and sometimes you sit down with a group of people and go back and forth and both things are really pleasurable. - And when you wander, I think one key thing is to notice a good idea and to maybe, to notice the kernel of a good idea. Maybe pull at that string. Because I don't think a good idea has come fully formed. - A hundred percent right. In fact, when I come up with what I think is a good idea and it survives kind of the first level of scrutiny, you know, that I do in my own head and I'm ready to tell somebody else about the idea, I will often say look, it is going to be really easy for you to find objections to this idea, but work with me. - There's something there. - There's something there. And that is intuition. - Yeah. - Because it's really easy to kill new ideas in the beginning. 'Cause they do have so many, so many easy objections to them. So you need to, you need to kind of forewarn people and say look, I know it's gonna take a lot of work to get this to a fully formed idea. Let's get started on that. It'll be fun. - So you got that ability to say cosine in you somewhere after all. Maybe not on math, but- - In a different domain. - Yeah. - There are a thousand ways to be smart, by the way. - Yeah. - And that is a really, like when I go around, you know, and I meet people, I'm always looking for the way that they're smart. And you find it is, that's one of the things that makes the world so interesting and fun is that it is not, it's not like IQ is a single dimension. There are people who are smart in such unique ways. - Yeah, you just gave me a good response to when somebody calls me an idiot on the internet. You know, that's a thousand ways to be smart, sir. - Well, they might tell you, yeah, but there are a million to be ways to be dumb. - Yeah, right. I feel like that's a Mark Twain quote. Okay. All right, you gave me an amazing tour of Blue Origin Rocket Factory and Launch Complex in the historic Cape Canaveral. That's where New Glenn, the big rocket we talked about is being built and will launch. Can you explain what the New Glenn Rocket is and tell me some interesting technical aspects of how it works? - Sure. New Glenn is a very large, a heavy lift launch vehicle. It'll take about 45 metric tons to LEO, very, very large class. It's about half the thrust, a little more than half the thrust of the Saturn V Rocket. So it's about 3.9 million pounds of thrust on liftoff. The booster has seven BE-4 engines. Each engine generates a little more than 550,000 pounds of thrust. The engines are fueled by liquid natural gas, liquified natural gas, LNG as the fuel and LOX as the oxidizer. The cycle is an ox-riched stage combustion cycle. It's a cycle that was really pioneered by the Russians. It's a very good cycle. And that engine is also going to power the first stage of the Vulcan rocket, which is the United Launch Alliance rocket. Then the second stage of New Glenn is powered by two BE-3U engines, which is a upper stage variant of our New Shephard liquid hydrogen engine. So the BE-3U has 160,000 pounds of thrust. So two of those 320,000 pounds of thrust and hydrogen is a very good propellant for upper stages because it has very high ISP. It's not a great propellant in my view for booster stages because the stages then get physically so large. Hydrogen has very high ISP, but liquid hydrogen is very, is not dense at all. So to store liquid hydrogen, you know, if you need to store many thousands of pounds of liquid hydrogen, your tanks, your liquid hydrogen tank, it's very large. So you really, you get more benefit from the higher ISP, the specific impulse. You get more benefit from the higher specific impulse on the second stage. And that stage carries less propellant. So you don't get such geometrically gigantic tanks. The Delta IV is an example of a vehicle that is all hydrogen. The booster stage is also hydrogen. And I think that it's a very effective vehicle, but it never was very cost effective. So it's operationally very capable but not very cost effective. - So size is also costly. - Size is costly. So it's interesting. Rockets love to be big. Everything works better. - What do you mean by that? You've told me that before. It sounds epic, but what does it mean? - I mean, when you look at the, kind of the physics of rocket engines and also when you look at parasitic mass, it doesn't, if you have, let's say you have an avionic system, so you have a guidance and control system, that is gonna be about the same mass and size for a giant rocket as it is gonna be for a tiny rocket. And so that's just parasitic mass that is very consequential if you're building a very small rocket, but is trivial if you're building a very large rocket. So you have the parasitic mass thing. And then if you look at, for example, rocket engines have turbo pumps. They have to pressurize the fuel and the oxidizer up to a very high pressure level in order to inject it into the thrust chamber where it burns. And those pumps, all rotating machines, in fact get more efficient as they get larger. So really tiny turbo pumps are very challenging to manufacture. And any kind of gaps, you know, are like between the housing for example, and the rotating impeller that pressurizes the fuel, there has to be some gap there. You can't have those parts scraping against one another. And those gaps drive inefficiencies. And so, you know, if you have a very large turbo pump, those gaps in percentage terms end up being very small. And so there's a bunch of things that you end up loving about having a large rocket and that you end up hating for a small rocket. But there's a giant exception to this rule, and it is manufacturing. So manufacturing large structures is very, very challenging. It's a pain in the butt. And so, you know, it's just if you have, if you're making a small rocket engine, you can move all the pieces by hand, you could assemble it on a table, one person can do it, you know, you don't need cranes and heavy lift operations and tooling, and so on and so on. When you start building big objects, infrastructure, civil infrastructure, just like the launchpad and the you know, all this, we went and visited, I took you to the launchpad and you can see it's so monumental. - Yeah, it is. - And so just these things become major undertakings, both from an engineering point of view, but also from a construction and cost point of view. - And even the foundation of the launchpad, I mean, this is Florida, like isn't like swamp land? Like how deep do you have to go? - You have to at Cape Canaveral, in fact, at most ocean, you know, most launch pads are on beaches somewhere in the oceanside. 'cause you wanna launch over water for safety reasons. The yes, you have to drive pilings, you know, dozens and dozens and dozens of pilings, you know, 50, a 100, 150 feet deep to get enough structural integrity for these very large, you know, it's yes, these turn into major civil engineering projects. - I just have to say everything about that factory is pretty badass. You said tooling, the bigger it gets, the more epic it is. - It does make it epic. - Yeah. - It's fun to look at. It's extraordinary. - It's humbling also, 'cause you know, humans are so small compared to it. - We are building these enormous machines that are harnessing enormous amounts of chemical power, you know, in very, very compact packages. It's truly extraordinary. - But then there's all the different components and that you know, the materials involved. Is there something interesting that you can describe about the materials that's comprised the rockets? So it has to be as light as possible, I guess, whilst withstanding the heat and the harsh conditions? - Yeah, I play a little kind of game sometimes with other rocket people that I run into where say what are the things that would amaze the 1960s engineers? Like what's changed? 'Cause surprisingly, some of rocketry greatest hits have not changed. They are still, they would recognize immediately a lot of what we do today. And it's exactly what they pioneered back in the '60s. But a few things have changed. You know, the use of carbon composites is very different today. You know, we can build very sophisticated, you saw our carbon tape laying machine that builds the giant fairings. And we can build these incredibly light, very stiff fairing structures out of carbon composite material that they could not have dreamed of. I mean the efficiency, the structural efficiency of that material is so high compared to any you know, metallic material you might use or anything else. So that's one. Aluminum lithium and the ability to friction stir weld aluminum lithium. Do you remember the friction stir welding that I showed you? - Yes, incredible. - This is a remarkable technology. This was invented decades ago, but has become very practical over just the last couple of decades. And instead of using heat to weld two pieces of metal together, it literally stirs the two pieces. There's a pin that rotates at a certain rate and you put that pin between the two plates of metal that you wanna weld together. And then you move it at a very precise speed. And instead of heating the material, it heats it a little bit because of friction, but not very much. You can literally immediately after welding with stir friction welding, you can touch the material and it's just barely warm. It literally stirs the molecules together. It's quite extraordinary. - Relatively low temperature. And I guess high temperature is what makes them, that makes it a weak point? - Exactly. So with traditional welding techniques, you may have whatever the underlying strength characteristics of the material are, you end up with weak regions where you weld. And with friction stir welding, the welds are just as strong as the bulk material. So it really allows you, and so, 'cause when you're, you know, let's say you're building a tank that you're gonna pressurize you know, a large liquid natural gas tank for our booster stage, for example. You know, if you are welding that with traditional methods, you have to size those weld lands, the thickness of those pieces with that knockdown for whatever damage you're doing with the weld. And that's gonna add a lot of weight to that tank. - I mean, even just the looking at the fairings, the result of that, the complex shape that it takes and- - Yeah. - And like what it's supposed to do is kind of incredible 'cause so people don't know it's on top of the rocket, it's gonna fall apart. That's its task. But it has to stay strong sometimes. - Yes. - And then disappear when it needs to. - That's right. - Which is a very difficult task. - Yes. When you need something that needs to have 100% integrity until it needs to have 0% integrity. It needs to stay attached until it's ready to go away. And then when it goes away, it has to go away completely. You use explosive charges for that. And so it's a very robust way of separating structure when you need to. - Exploding - Yeah. Little tiny bits of explosive material and it just, it'll sever the whole connection. - So if you wanna go from 100% structural integrity to zero as fast as possible use explosives, - Use explosives. - The entirety of this thing is so badass. Okay, so we're back to the two stages. So the first stage is reusable. - Yeah. Second stage is expendable. Second stage is liquid hydrogen, liquid oxygen. So we could take advantage of the higher specific impulse. The the first stage lands downrange on a landing platform in the ocean, comes back for maintenance and get ready to do the next mission. - I mean there's a million questions, but also is there a path towards reusability for the second stage? - There is, and we know how to do that. Right now we're gonna work on manufacturing that second stage to make it as inexpensive as possible. Sort of two paths for a second stage, make it reusable, or work really hard to make it inexpensive so you can afford to expend it. And that trade is actually not obvious which one is better. - Even in terms of cost. Even like time cost? - I'm talking about cost is, you know, space flight, getting into orbit is a solved problem. We solved it back in you know, the '50s and '60s. - You're making it sound easy. - So the only thing that, the only interesting problem is dramatically reducing the cost of access to orbit, which is if you can do that, you open up a bunch of new, you know, endeavors that lots of startup companies, everybody else can do. So that's, we really, that's one of our missions is to you know, be part of this industry and lower the cost to orbit so that there can be you know, a kind of a renaissance, a golden age of people doing all kinds of interesting things in space. - I like how you said getting to orbit is a solved problem. It is just the only interesting thing is reducing the cost. You know, how you can describe every single problem facing human civilization that way. The physicist would say everything is a solved problem. We've solved everything. The rest is just well, Rutherford said that \"it's just stamp collecting.\" It's just the details. It's some of the greatest innovations and inventions and you know, brilliance is in that cost reduction stage. Right, and you, you've had a long career of cost reduction. - For sure. And when you, what does cost reduction really mean? It means inventing a better way. - Yeah, exactly. - Right, and when you invent a better way, you make the whole world richer. So, you know, whatever it was, I don't know how many thousands of years ago, somebody invented the plow. And when they invented the plow, they made the whole world richer because they made farming less expensive. And so it is a big deal to invent better ways. That's how the world gets richer. - So what are some of the biggest challenges on the manufacturing side and the engineering side that you're facing in working to get to the first launch of New Glenn? - The first launch is one thing and we'll do that in 2024 coming up in this coming year. The real thing that's the bigger challenge is making sure that our factory is efficiently manufacturing at rate. So rate production. So consider if you wanna launch New Glenn you know, 24 times a year. You need to manufacture a upper stage since they're expendable every, you know, twice a month, you need to do one every two weeks. So you need to be, you need to have all of your manufacturing facilities and processes and inspection techniques and acceptance tests and everything operating at rate. And rate manufacturing is at least as difficult as designing the vehicle in the first place. And the same thing. So every upper stage has two BE-3U engines. So those engines you know, you need if you're gonna launch this the vehicle twice a month, you need four engines a month. So you need an engine every week. So you need to be, that engine needs to be being produced at rate. And that's a, and there's all of the things that you need to do that, all the right machine tools, all the right fixtures, the right people, process, et cetera. So it's one thing to build a first article, right. So that's you know, to launch New Glenn for the first time, you need to produce a first article. But that's not the hard part. The hard part is everything that's going on behind the scenes to build a factory that can produce New Glenn's at rate. - So the first one is produced in a way that enables the production of the second and third and the fourth and the fifth and sixth, and so on. - You could think of the first article as kind of pushing, it pushes all of the rate manufacturing technology along. You know, in other words, it's kind of the, it's the test article in a way that's testing out your manufacturing technologies. - The manufacturing is the big challenge. - Yes. I mean I don't want to make it sound like any of it is easy. I mean the people who are designing the engines and all this, all of it is hard for sure. But the challenge right now is driving really hard to get to rate manufacturing and to do that in an efficient way. Again, kind of back to our cost point. If you get to rate manufacturing in an inefficient way, you haven't really solved the cost problem and maybe you haven't really moved this state of the art forward. All this has to be about moving the state-of-the art forward. There are easier businesses to do. I always tell people look, if you are trying to make money, you know, like start a salty snack food company or something, you know. - I'm gonna write that idea down. - Like make the Lex Fridman potato chips, you know, this is- - Don't say it, people are gonna steal it. But yeah, it's hard. - You see what I'm saying? It's like there's nothing easy about this business but it's its own reward. It's fascinating, it's worthwhile, it's meaningful. And so you know, not, I don't wanna pick on salty snack food companies, but I think it's less meaningful. You know, at the end of the day, you're not gonna have accomplished something amazing. - Yeah, there's- - Even if you do make a lot of money out of it. - Yeah, there's something fundamentally different about the quote unquote business of space exploration. - Yeah, for sure. - It's a grand project of humanity. - Yes. It's one of humanity's grand challenges. And especially as you look at going to the moon and going to Mars and building giant O'Neill colonies and unlocking all the things. You know, I won't live long enough to see the fruits of this, but the fruits of this come from building a road to space, getting the infrastructure. I'll give you an analogy. When I started Amazon, I didn't have to develop a payment system. It already existed. It was called the credit card. I didn't have to develop a transportation system to deliver the packages. It already existed. It was called the postal service and Royal Mail and Deutsche Post. And so all this heavy lifting infrastructure was already in place. And I could stand on its shoulders. And that's why when you look at the internet, you know, by the way, another giant piece of infrastructure that was around in the early, I'm taking you back to like 1994, people were using dial up modems. And it was piggybacking on top of the long distance phone network. That's how the internet, that's you know, how people were accessing servers and so on. And that again, if that hadn't existed, it would've been hundreds of billions of CapEx to put that out there. No startup company could have done that. And so the problem you know, you see in, if you look at the dynamism in the internet space over the last 20 years, it's because you know, you see like two kids in a dorm room could start an internet company that could be successful and do amazing things. Beause they didn't have to build heavy infrastructure. It was already there. And that's what I wanna do. I take you know, my Amazon winnings and use that to build heavy infrastructure so that the next generation you know, the generation that's my children and their children, these, you know, those generations can then use that heavy infrastructure. Then there'll be space entrepreneurs who start in their dorm room. - Yeah. - Like that will be a marker of success. When you can have a really valuable space company started in a dorm room, then we know that we've built enough infrastructure so that ingenuity and imagination can really be unleashed. I find that very exciting. - As they will of course, as kids do, take all of this hard infrastructurability for granted. - Of course. Which is- - That's the entrepreneurial spirit. - That's an inventors greatest dream. - Yeah. - Is that their inventions are so successful that they are one day taken for granted. You know, nobody thinks of Amazon as an invention anymore. Nobody thinks of customer reviews as, we pioneered customer reviews, but now they're so commonplace. Same thing with one click shopping and so on. But that's a compliment. That's how you know, you invent something that's so used, so beneficially used by so many people that they take it for granted. - I don't know about nobody. That's every time I use Amazon, I'm still amazed how does this work? Logistics. - Well, that proves you're very curious explorer. - All right, all right, back to rockets. Timeline. You said 2024. As it stands now, are both the first test launch and the launch of escapade explorers to Mars still possible? - In 2024? - In 2024. Yeah. - Yeah, I think so. For sure the first launch, and then we'll see if escapade goes on that or not. I think that the first launch for sure. And I hope escapade too. - Hope. - Well, I just don't know which mission it's actually gonna be slated on. So we also have other things that might go on that first mission. - Oh, I got it. But you're optimistic that the launches will still- - Oh, the first launch, I'm very optimistic that the first launch of New Glenn will be in 2024. And I'm just not a hundred percent certain what payload will be on that first launch. - Are you nervous about it? - Are you kidding? I'm extremely nervous about it. - Oh man. - A hundred percent. I've, you know, every launch I go to, you know, for New Shephard, for other vehicles too, I'm always nervous for these launches. But yes, for sure. A first launch to have no nervousness about that would be, you know, some sign of derangement, I think so. - Well, I got to visit the launchpad, it's pretty, I mean, it's epic. - You know, we have done a tremendous amount of ground testing, a tremendous amount of simulation. So, you know, a lot of the problems that we might find in flight have been resolved, but there are some problems you can only find in flight. So, you know, cross your fingers. I guarantee you, you'll have fun watching it no matter what happens. - 100% when the thing is fully assembled and comes up. - Yeah, the transporter erector. - The erector, yeah. - Just the transporter erector for a rocket of this scale - Yeah. - is extraordinary. - That's an incredible machine. - The vehicle travels out horizontally and then kind of- - Yeah. - You know, comes up. - Over a few hours? - Yeah, it's a beautiful thing to watch. - Speaking of which, if that makes you nervous, I don't know if you remember, but you were aboard a New Shephard on its first crude flight. How was that experience? Were you terrified then? - You know, strangely, I wasn't, you know. - When you ride the rocket- - It's true. - less nerve wracking. - Its true. I've watched other people ride the rocket and I'm more nervous than when I was inside the rocket myself. It was a difficult conversation to have with my mother when I told her I was gonna go on the first one. And not only was I gonna go, but I was gonna bring my brother too. This is a tough conversation to have with a mom. - There's a long pause when you told her. - She's like both of you? And it was an incredible experience and we were laughing inside the capsule and you know, we're not nervous. The people on the ground were very nervous for us. It was actually one of the most emotionally powerful parts of the experience was not happened even before the flight at 4:30 in the morning, brother and I are getting ready to go to the launch site and Lauren is gonna take us there in her helicopter and we're getting ready to leave. And we go outside the ranch house there in west Texas where the launch facility is. And all of our family, my kids and my brother's kids and our you know, our parents, and close friends are assembled there. And they're saying goodbye to us, but they're kind of saying, maybe they think they're saying goodbye to us forever. And you know, we might not have felt that way. But it was obvious from their faces how nervous they were that they felt that way. And it was sort of powerful because it allowed us to see, it was almost like attending your own memorial service or something. Like you could feel how loved you were in that moment. And it was really amazing. - Yeah, and I mean there's just a epic nature to it too. - The accent, the floating and zero gravity. I'll tell you something very interesting. Zero gravity feels very natural. I don't know if it's because we are, you know, it's like return to the womb or what. - You just confirmed you're an alien. But that's okay. I think that's what you just said. - It feels so natural to be in zero G. It was really interesting. And then what people talk about the overview effect and seeing earth from space, I had that feeling very powerfully. I think everyone did. You see how fragile the earth is. If you're not an environmentalist, it will make you one. The the great Jim Lovell quote, you know, he looked back at the earth from space and he said he realized \"you don't go to heaven when you die. You go to heaven when you're born.\" And it's just you know, that's the feeling that people get when they're in space. You see all this blackness, all this nothingness, and there's one gem of life, and it's earth. - It is a gem. What, you know, you've talked a lot about decision making throughout your time with Amazon. What was that decision like to be the first to ride New Shephard? Like what, just be before you talked to your mom. - Yeah. - What, like the pros and cons, like actually as one human being, as a leader of a company on all fronts, like what was that decision making like? - I decided that, first of all, I knew the vehicle extremely well. I know the team who built it. I know the vehicle. I am very comfortable with like the escape system. We put as much effort into the escape system on that vehicle as we put into all the rest of the vehicle combined. It's one of the hardest pieces of engineering in the entire New Shephard architecture. - Can you actually describe, what do you mean by escape system? What's involved? - We have a solid rocket motor in the base of the crew capsule so that if anything goes wrong on ascent, you know, while the main rocket engine is firing, we can ignite this solid rocket motor in the base of the crew capsule and escape from the booster. It's a very challenging system to build, design, validate, test, all of these things. It is the reason that I am comfortable letting anyone go on New Shephard. So the booster is as safe and reliable as we can make it. But we are harnessing, whenever you're talking about rocket engines, I don't care what rocket engine you're talking about, you are harnessing such vast power in such a small, compact, geometric space. The power density is so enormous that it is impossible to ever be sure that nothing will go wrong. And so the only way to improve safety is to have an escape system. And you know, and historically rockets, human rated rockets have had escape systems. Only the space shuttle did not. And, but Apollo had one, you know, all of the previous, you know, Gemini, et cetera, they all had escape systems. And we have on New shephard of unusual escapes, most escape systems are towers. We have a pusher escape system. So the solid rocket motor is actually embedded in the base of the crew capsule. And it pushes and it's reusable in the sense that if we don't use it, so if we have a nominal mission, we land with it. The tower systems have to be ejected at a certain point in the mission, and so they get wasted even in a nominal mission. And so again, you know, cost really matters on these things. So we figured out how to have the escape system be a reusable , in the event that it's not used, you can reuse it and have it be a pusher system. It's a very sophisticated thing. So I knew these things. You asked me about my decision to go and so I know the vehicle very well. I know the people who designed it. I had great trust in them and in the engineering that we did. And I thought to myself look, if I am not ready to go, then I wouldn't want anyone to go. A tourism vehicle has to be designed in my view, to have very, to be as safe as one can make it. You can't make it perfectly safe. It's impossible. But you know, you just have to, people will do things. People take risks, you know, they climb mountains, they skydive, they do deep underwater scuba diving, and so on. People are okay taking risk. You can't eliminate the risk. But it is something, because it's a tourism vehicle, you have to do your utmost to eliminate those risks. And I felt very good about the system. I think it's one of the reasons I was so calm inside and maybe others weren't just calm, they didn't know as much about it as I did. - Who was in charge of engaging the escape system? Did you have- - It's automated. - Okay. - The escape system is- - I was visualizing deployment of that. - is completely automated. Automated is better because it can react so much faster. - So yeah, for tourism rockets safety is a huge, huge, huge priority for space exploration also, but a tiny, you know, a delta less. - Yes. I mean I think for you know, if you're doing, you know, there are human activities where we tolerate more risk. If you're saving somebody's life, you know, if you are engaging in real exploration, these are things where, you know, I personally think we would accept more risk in part because you have to. - Is there a part of you that's frustrated by the rate of progress in Blue Origin? - Blue Origin needs to be much faster. And it's one of the reasons that I left my role as the CEO of Amazon a couple of years ago. I needed, I wanted to come in and Blue Origin needs me right now. And so I had always, when I was the CEO of Amazon, my point of view on this is if I'm the CEO of a publicly traded company it's going to get my full attention. And I really, it's just how I think about things. It was very important to me. I felt I had an obligation to all the stakeholders at Amazon to do that. And so having, you know, turned the CEO, I'm still the executive chair there, but I've turned the CEO role over. And the reason, the primary reason I did that is so that I could spend time on Blue Origin adding some you know, energy, some sense of urgency. We need to move much faster and we're going to. - What are the ways to speed it up? So, I mean there's, you've talked a lot of different ways to sort of at Amazon, you know, removing barriers for progress or distributing, making everybody autonomous and self reliant in terms of all those kinds of things. Is that apply at Blue Origin or is the- - It does apply. You know, I'm leading this directly. We are gonna become the world's most decisive company across any industry. And so you know, at Amazon ever since the beginning, I said we are gonna become the world's most customer obsessed company. And no matter the industry, like people, one day people are going to come to Amazon from the healthcare industry and wanna know how did you guys, how are you so customer obsessed? How do you actually not just pay lip service, but actually do that? And from you know, all different industries should come on and study us to see how we accomplish that. And the analogous thing at Blue Origin and it will help us move faster is we are gonna become the world's most decisive company. We're gonna get really good at taking appropriate technology risk and making those decisions quickly. You know, being bold on those things. That's what, and having the right culture that supports that. You need people to be ambitious, technically ambitious. You know, if there are five ways to do something, we'll study them. But let's study them very quickly and make a decision. We can always change our mind. It doesn't you know, changing your mind is, I took about one-way doors and two-way doors. Most decisions are two-way doors. - Can ou explain that? 'Cause I love that metaphor. - If you make the wrong decision, if it's a two-way door decision, you walk out the door, you pick a door, you walk out, and you spend a little time there. It turns out to be the wrong decision, you can come back in and pick another door. Some decisions are so consequential and so important and so hard to reverse that they really are one-way door decisions. You go in that door, you're not coming back. And those decisions have to be made very deliberately, very carefully. If you can think of yet another way to analyze the decision, you should slow down and do that. So, you know, when I was the CEO of Amazon, I often found myself in the position of being the chief slowdown officer because somebody would be bringing me a one-way door decision. And I would say okay, I can think of three more ways to analyze that. So let's go do that. Because we ha we are not gonna be able to reverse this one easily. Maybe you can reverse it, but it's gonna be very costly and very time consuming. We really have to get this one right from the beginning. And what happens, unfortunately in companies, what can happen is that you have a one size fits all decision making process where you end up using the heavyweight process on all decisions. - For everything, yeah. - Including the lightweight ones. The two-way door decisions. Two-way door decisions should mostly be made by single individuals or by very small teams deep in the organization. And one-way door decisions are the ones the irreversible ones, those are the ones that should be elevated up to you know, the senior most executives who should slow them down and make sure that the right thing is being done. - Yeah, I mean, part of the skill here is to know the difference in one-way and two-way, I think you mentioned. - Yes. - I mean I think you mentioned Amazon Prime, the decision to sort of create Amazon Prime as a one-way door. I mean, it's not, it's unclear if it is or not, but it probably is, and it's a really big risk to go there. - There are a bunch of decisions like that that are you know, changing the decision is gonna be very, very complicated. Some of them are technical decisions too, because some technical decisions are like quick drying cement. You know, if you're gonna, once you make 'em, it gets really hard. I mean, you know, choosing which propellants to use in a vehicle. You know, selecting LNG for the booster stage and selecting hydrogen for the upper stage, that has turned out to be a very good decision. But if you changed your mind, that would be a very, that would be a very big setback. Do you see what I'm saying? - Yeah. - So that's the kind of decision you scrutinize very, very carefully. Other things just aren't like that. Most decisions are not that way. Most decisions should be made by single individuals, but they need, and done quickly in the full understanding that you can always change your mind. - Yeah, one of the things I really liked, perhaps it's not a two-way door decision is I disagree and commit phrase. So don't, so somebody brings up an idea to you. If it's a two-way door, you state that you don't understand enough to agree, but you still back them. I'd love for you to explain it. - Yeah, disagree and commit is a really important principle that saves a lot of arguing. - Yeah. - So- - I'm gonna use that in my personal life. I disagree, but commit. - It's very common in any endeavor in life, in business, and any you know, anybody where you have teammates. You have a teammate and the two of you disagree. At some point you have to make a decision. And you know, in companies we tend to organize hierarchically. So there's this you know, whoever's the more senior person ultimately gets to make the decision. So ultimately the CEO gets to make that decision. And the CEO may not always make the decision that they agree with. So like you know, I would often I would be the one who would disagree and commit. One of my direct reports would very much wanna do it, do something in a particular way. I would think it was a bad idea. I would explain my point of view. They would say Jeff, I think you're wrong, and here's why. And we would go back and forth and I would often say you know what? I don't think you're right, but I'm gonna gamble with you and you're closer to the ground truth than I am. I had known you for 20 years, you have great judgment. I don't know that I'm right either. Not really, not for sure. All these decisions are complicated. Let's do it your way. But at least then you've made a decision. And I'm agreeing to commit to that decision. So I'm not gonna be second guessing it. I'm not gonna be sniping at it. I'm not gonna be saying I told you so. I'm gonna try actively to help make sure it works. That's a really important teammate behavior. There's so many ways that dispute resolution is a really interesting thing on teams. And there are so many ways when two people disagree about something, even, I'm assuming in the case where everybody's well intentioned, they just have a very different opinion about what the right decision is. And we have, in our society and inside companies, we have a bunch of mechanisms that we use to resolve these kinds of disputes. A lot of 'em are, I think really bad. So, you know, an example of a really bad way of coming to agreement is compromise. So compromise, you know, look, we're in a room here and I could say Lex, how tall do you think this ceiling is? And you'd be like I don't know, Jeff, maybe 12 feet tall. And I would say I think it's 11 feet tall. - Yeah. - And then we'd say you know what? Let's just call it 11 and a half feet. That's compromise. - Yeah. - Instead of the right thing to do is you know, to get a tape measure or figure out some way of actually measuring, but think getting that tape measure and figure out how to get it to the top of the ceiling and all these things that requires energy. Compromise, the advantage of compromise as a resolution mechanism is that it's low energy, but it doesn't lead to truth. And so in things like the height of the ceiling, where truth is a noble thing, you shouldn't allow compromise to be used when you can know the truth. Another really bad resolution mechanism that happens all the time is just who's more stubborn. - Yeah. - This is also, let's say two executives who disagree and they just have a war of attrition. And whichever one gets exhausted first capitulates to the other one. Again, you haven't arrived at truth. And this is very demoralizing. So, you know, this is where escalation, I try to ask people who you know, on my team and say never get to a point where you are resolving something by you know, who gets exhausted first. Escalate that. I'll help you make the decision. Because that's so de-energized and such a terrible, lousy way to make a decision. - So you want to get to the resolution as quickly as possible because that ultimately leads to high velocity of decision. - Yes. And you wanna try to get as close to truth as possible. So you want like you know, exhausting the other person is not truth seeking. - Yes. - And compromise is not truth seeking. So, you know, it doesn't mean, now, and there are a lot of cases where no one knows the real truth and that's where disagreeing commit can come in. But it's escalation is better than more of attrition. Escalate to you know, to your boss and say hey, we can't agree on this. We like each other, we're respectful of each other, but we strongly disagree with each other. We need you to you know, make a decision here so we can move forward. But decisiveness, moving forward quickly on decisions as quickly as you responsibly can is how you increase velocity. Most of what slows things down is taking too long to make decisions at all scale levels. You know, so it has to be part of the culture to get high velocity. You know, Amazon has a million and a half people and the company is still fast. We're still decisive, we're still quick. And that's because the culture supports that. - At every scale in a distributed way. - Yes. - Try to maximize the velocity of decisions. - Exactly. - You've mentioned the lunar program. Let me ask you about that. - Yeah. - There's a lot going on there and you haven't really talked about it much. So in addition to the Artemis program with NASA, Blue is doing its own lander program. Can you describe it? There's a sexy picture on Instagram with one of them. Is it the MK1, I guess? - Yeah, The MK1. The picture is me with Bill Nelson, the NASA administrator. - Just to clarify, the Lander is the sexy thing about the Instagram. Really wanna clarify that. - I know it's not me. I know it was either the lander or Bill. - Okay. I love Bill, but- - Thank you for clarifying. - Okay. - Yes, the MK1 Lander is designed to take 3000 kilograms to the surface of the moon in a cargo, expendable cargo. It's an expendable lander. Lands on the moon, stays there, take 3000 kilograms to the surface. It can be launched on a single New Glenn flight, which is very important. So it's a relatively simple architecture, just like the human landing system lander that they called the MK2. MK1 is also fueled with liquid hydrogen, and which is for high energy emissions, like landing on the surface of the moon, the high specific impulse of hydrogen is a very big advantage. The disadvantage of hydrogen has always been that it's, since it's such a deep cryogen, it's not storable. So it's constantly boiling off and you're losing propellant because it's boiling off. And so we're doing, as part of our lunar program, it's developing solar powered cryo coolers that can actually make hydrogen a storable propellant for deep space. And that's a real game changer. It's a game changer for any high energy mission. So to the moon, but to the outer planets, to Mars, everywhere. - So the idea with MK1, both MK1 and MK2 is the New Glenn can carry it from the surface of earth to the surface of the moon. - Exactly. So the Mk1 is expendable. The lunar lander we're developing for NASA, the Mk2 lander, that's part of the Artemis program. They call it the sustaining lander program. So that lander is designed to be reusable. It can land on the surface of the moon in a single stage configuration and then take off. So the whole you know, if you look at the Apollo program, the lunar lander and Apollo was really two stages. It would land on the surface and then it would leave the descent stage on the surface of the moon, and only the absent stage would go back up into lunar orbit where it would rendezvous with the command module. Here what we're doing is we have a single stage lunar lander that carries down enough propellant so that it can bring the whole thing back up so that it can be reused over and over. And the point of doing that, of course, is to reduce cost so that you can make lunar missions more affordable over time, which is, that's one of NASA's big objectives because this time the whole point of Artemis is go back to the moon, but this time to stay. So, you know, back in the Apollo program, we went to the moon six times and then ended the program and it really was too expensive to continue. - And so there's a few questions there, but one is how do you stay on the moon? What ideas do you have about- - Yeah. - Like sustaining life where a few folks can stay there for prolonged periods of time? - Well, one of the things we're working on is using lunar resources like lunar regolith to manufacture commodities and even solar cells on the surface of the moon. We've already built a solar cell that is completely made from lunar regolith stimulant, and this solar cell is only about 7% power efficient. So it's very inefficient compared to you know, the more advanced solar cells that we make here on earth. But if you can figure out how to make a practical solar cell factory that you can land on the surface of the moon, and then the raw material for those solar cells is simply lunar regolith, then you can just you know, continue to churn out solar cells on the surface of the moon, have lots of power on the surface of the moon. That will make it easier for people to live on the moon. Similarly, we're working on extracting oxygen from lunar regolith. So lunar regolith by weight has a lot of oxygen in it. It's bound very tightly, you know, as oxides with other elements. And so you have to separate the oxygen, which is very energy intensive. So that also could work together with the solar cells. But if you can, and then ultimately we may be able to find practical quantities of ice in the permanently shadowed craters on the poles of the moon. And we know there is ice water in those, or water ice in those craters. And we know that we can break that down with electrolysis into hydrogen and oxygen. And then you'd not only have oxygen, but you'd also have a very good high efficiency propellant fuel in hydrogen. So there's a lot we can do to make the moon more sustainable over time. But the very first step, the thing, the kind of gate that all of that has to go through is we need to be able to land cargo and humans on the surface of the moon at an acceptable cost. - To fast forward a little bit, is there any chance Jeff Bezos steps foot on the moon and on Mars? One or the other, or both? - It's very unlikely. I think it's probably something that gets done by future generations by the time it gets to me. I think in my lifetime that's probably gonna be done by professional astronauts. Sadly, I would love to sign up for that mission. So don't count me out yet, Lex, you know, give me a fighting shot here maybe. But I think if we are placing reasonable bets on such a thing, in my lifetime, that will continue to be done by professional astronauts. - Yeah, so these are risky, difficult missions. - And probably missions that require a lot of training. You know, you are going there for a very specific purpose to do something. We're gonna be able to do a lot on the moon too with automation. So, you know, in terms of setting up these factories and doing all that, we are sophisticated enough now with automation and we probably don't need humans to tend those factories and machines. So there's a lot that's gonna be done in both modes. - So I have to ask the bigger picture question about the two companies pushing humanity forward out towards the stars, Blue Origin and SpaceX. Are you competitors, collaborators? Which, and to what degree? - Well, I would say you know, just like the internet is big and there are lots of winners at all scale levels. I mean, there are half a dozen giant companies that you know, the internet has made, but they're a bunch of medium sized companies and a bunch of small companies, all successful, all with profits, dreams, all driving great customer experiences. That's what we wanna see in space. That kind of dynamism and space is big. There's room for a bunch of winners and it's gonna happen at all skill levels. And so you know, SpaceX is gonna be successful for sure. I want Blue Origin to be successful and I hope there are another you know, five companies right behind us. - But, you know, I spoke to Elon a few times recently about you, about Blue Origin, and he was very positive about you as a person and very supportive of all the efforts you've been leading at Blue. What's your thoughts? You worked with a lot of leaders at Amazon, at Blue. What's your thoughts about Elon as a human being and a leader? - Well, I don't really know Elon very well. You know, I know his public persona, but I also know you can't know anyone by their public persona. It's impossible. I mean you may think you do, but I guarantee you don't. So I don't really know, you know Elon way better than I do Lex, but in terms of his, judging by the results, he must be a very capable leader. There's no way you could have you know, Tesla and SpaceX without being a capable leader. It's impossible. - Yeah, I just, I hope you guys hang out sometimes, shake hands, and sort of have a kind of friendship that would inspire just the entirety of humanity. 'cause you, what you're doing is like one of the big grand challenges ahead for humanity. - Well, I agree with you and I think in a lot of these endeavors, we're very like-minded. - Yeah. - And so I think, you know, I'm not saying we're identical, but I think we're very like-minded. And so I, you know, I love that idea. - All right, going back to sexy pictures on your Instagram, there's a video of you from the early days of Amazon giving a tour of your quote sort of offices. I think your dad is holding the camera. - He is, yeah. I know, right. Yes. This is what the giant orange extension cord and yeah. - And you're like explaining the genius of the extension cord and how this is a desk and the CRT monitor and sort of that's where all the magic happens. I forget what your dad said, but this is like the center of it all. So what was it like, what was going through your mind at that time? You left a good job in New York and took this leap. Were you excited? Were you scared? - So excited and scared. Anxious, you know, thought the odds of success were low, told all of our early investors that I thought there was a 30% chance of success by which I mean just be getting your money back. Not like, not what actually happened. Because that's the truth. Every startup company is unlikely to work. It's helpful to be in reality about that, but that doesn't mean you can't be optimistic. So you kind of have to have this duality in your head. Like on the one hand, you know what the baseline statistics say about startup companies. And the other hand you have to ignore all of that and just be a hundred percent sure it's gonna work. And you're doing both things at the same time. You're holding that contradiction in your head. But it was so, it was so exciting. I love you know, every, from 1994 when the company was founded to 1995, when we opened our doors all the way until today, I find Amazon so exciting. And that doesn't mean it's like full of pain, full of problems, you know, it's like there's so many things that need to be resolved and worked and made better, and et cetera. But on balance, it's so fun. It's such a privilege. It's been such a joy. I feel so grateful that I've been part of that journey. It's just been incredible. - So in some sense, you don't want a single day of comfort. You've written about this many times. We'll talk about your writing, which I would highly recommend people read and just the letters to shareholders. So you wrote up explaining the idea of day one thinking, I think you first wrote about in 97 letters to shareholders. Then you also, in a way wrote it about sad to say, is your last letter to shareholders as CEO. And you said that day two is stasis followed by irrelevance, followed by excruciating painful decline, followed by death. And that is why it's always day one. Can you explain this day one thing? This is a really powerful way to describe the beginning and the journey of Amazon. - It's really a very simple, and I think age old idea about renewal and rebirth. And like every day is day one. Every day you are deciding what you're gonna do. And you are not trapped by what you were or who you were, or any self-consistency. Self-consistency even can be a trap. And so day one thinking is kind of, we start fresh every day and we get to make new decisions every day about invention, about customers, about how we're going to operate, what our, even as deeply as what our principles are. We can go back to that. It turns out we don't change those very often, but we change them occasionally. And when we work on programs at Amazon, we often make a list of tenants. And this, the tenants are kind of, they're not principles. They're a little more tactical than principles, but it's kind of the main ideas that we want this program to embody, whatever those are. And one of the things that we do is we put, these are the tenets for this program. And in parentheses we always put, unless you know a better way. And that idea, unless you know a better way, is so important because you never want to get trapped by dogma. You never wanna get trapped by history. It doesn't mean you discard history or ignore it. There's so much value in what has worked in the past. But you can't be blindly following what you've done. And that's the heart of day one is you're always starting fresh. - And to the question of how to fend off day two, you said such a question, can't have a simple answer as you're saying, there will be many elements, multiple paths, and many traps. I don't know the whole answer, but I may know bits of it. Here's a starter pack of essentials. Maybe others come to mind for day one, defense, customer obsession, a skeptical view of proxies, the eager adoption of external trends and high velocity decision making. So we talked about high velocity decision making, that's more difficult than it sounds. So maybe you can pick one that stands out to you as you can comment on. Eager adoption of external trends, high velocity decision making, skeptical view of proxies. How do you fight off day two? - Well, you know, I'll talk about, because I think it's the one that is maybe in some ways the hardest to understand is the skeptical view of proxies. One of the things that happens in business, probably anything that you're, where you're you know, you have an ongoing program and something is underway for a number of years, is you develop certain things that you're managing to like, let's say the typical case would be a metric. And that metric isn't the real underlying thing. And so you know, maybe the metric is efficiency metric around customer contacts per unit sold or something. If you sell a million units, how many customer contacts do you get? Or how many returns do you get? And so on and so on. And so what happens is a little bit of a kind of a inertia sets in where somebody a long time ago invented that metric and they invented that metric. They decided we need to watch for you know, customer returns per unit sold as an important metric. But they had a reason why they chose that metric. The person who invented that metric and decided it was worth watching. And then fast forward five years, that metric is the proxy. - The proxy for truth, I guess. - The proxy for truth, the proxy for customer, let's say in this case, it's a proxy for customer happiness. And, but that metric is not actually customer happiness, it's a proxy for customer happiness. The person who invented the metric understood that connection. Five years later, a kind of inertia can set in and you forget the truth behind why you were watching that metric in the first place. And the world shifts a little. And now that proxy isn't as valuable as it used to be or it's missing something. And you have to be on alert for that. You have to know, okay, this is, I don't really care about this metric. I care about customer happiness. And this metric is worth putting energy into and following and improving and scrutinizing only in so much as it actually affects customer happiness. And so you've gotta constantly be on guard. And it's very, very common. This is a nuanced problem. It's very common, especially in large companies, that they're managing to metrics that they don't really understand. They don't really know why they exist. And the world may have shifted out from under them a little. And the metrics are no longer as relevant as they were when somebody 10 years earlier invented the metric. - That is a nuance, but that's a big problem, right? - It's a huge problem. - That something so compelling to have a nice metric to try to optimize. - Yes. And by the way, you do need metrics. - Yes you do. - You know, you can't ignore them, and want them, but you just have to be constantly on guard. This is, you know, a way to slip into day two thinking would be to manage your business to metrics that you don't really understand. And you're not really sure why they were invented in the first place, and you're not sure they're still as relevant as they used to be. - What does it take to be the guy or gal who brings up the point that this proxy might be outdated? I guess what does it take to have a culture that enables that in the meeting? 'Cause that's a very uncomfortable thing to bring up at a meeting. We all showed up here, it's a Friday. - This is such, you have just asked a million dollar question. So this is what you're, if I generalize what you're asking, you are talking in general about truth telling. - Yeah. - And we humans are not really truth seeking animals. We are social animals. - Yeah, we are. - And you know, take you back in time 10,000 years and you're in a small village, if you go along to get along, you can survive. You can procreate. If you're the village truth teller, you might get clubbed to death in the middle of the night. Truths are often, they don't want to be heard. 'Cause important truths can be uncomfortable, they can be awkward, they can be exhausting. - Impolite and all that kind of stuff. - Yes, challenging. They can make people defensive even if that's not the intent. But any high performing organization, whether it's a sports team, a business, you know, a political organization, an activist group, I don't care what it is. Any high performing organization has to have mechanisms and a culture that supports truth telling. One of the things you have to do is you have to talk about that. And you have to talk about the fact that it takes energy to do that. And you have to talk to people, you have to remind people it's okay that it's uncomfortable. You have to literally tell people it's not what we're designed to do as humans. It's not really, it's kind of a side effect. You know, we can do that, but it's not how we survive. We mostly survive by being social animals and being cordial and cooperative. And that's really important. And so there's a, you know, science is all about truth telling. It's actually a very formal mechanism for trying to tell the truth. And even in science, you find that it's hard to tell the truth. Right. Even, you know, you're supposed to have hypothesis and test it and find data and reject the hypothesis, and so on. It's not easy. - But even in science, there's like the senior scientists and the junior scientists. - Correct. - And then there's a hierarchy of humans where somehow seniority matters. - Yes. - In the scientific process, which is odd. - And that's true inside companies too. And so you wanna set up your culture so that the most junior person can overrule the most senior person if they have data. And that really is about trying to you know, there are little things you can do. So for example, in every meeting that I attend, I always speak last. And I know from experience that, you know, if I speak first, even very strong-willed, highly intelligent, high judgment participants in that meeting will wonder, well if Jeff thinks that I came in this meeting thinking one thing, but maybe I'm not right. And so you can do little things like if you're the most senior person in the room, go last. Let everybody else go first. In fact, ideally let's try to have the most junior person go first and the second and try to go in order of seniority so that you can hear everyone's opinion in a kind of unfiltered way. Because we really do, we actually literally change our opinions. If somebody who you really respect says something, it makes you change your mind a little. - So you're saying implicitly or explicitly give permission for people to have a strong opinion as long as it's backed by data. - Yes. And sometimes it can even, by the way, a lot of our most powerful truths turn out to be hunches. They turn out to be based on anecdotes. They're intuition based. And sometimes you don't even have strong data, but you may know the person well enough to trust their judgment. You may feel yourself leaning in. It may resonate with a set of anecdotes you have. And then you may be able to say you know, something about that feels right. Let's go collect some data on that. Let's try to see if we can actually know whether it's right. But for now, let's not disregard it 'cause it feels right. You can also fight inherent bias. There's an optimism bias. Like if there are two interpretations of a new set of data and one of them is happy and one of 'em is unhappy, it's a little dangerous to jump to the conclusion that the happy interpretation is right. You may want to sort of compensate for that human bias of looking for you know, trying to find the silver lining and say look, that might be good, but I'm gonna go with it's bad for now until we're sure. - So speaking of happiness bias, data collection, and anecdotes, you have to, how's that for a transition? You have to tell me the story of the call you made, the customer service call you made to demonstrate a point about wait times. - Yeah, this is very early in the history of Amazon. And we were going over a weekly business review and a set of documents, and I have a saying, which is when the data and the anecdotes disagree, the anecdotes are usually right. And it doesn't mean you just slavishly go follow the anecdotes then. It means you go examine the data. 'Cause the data, and it's usually not that the data is being miscollected, it's usually that you're not measuring the right thing. And so, you know, if you have a bunch of customers complaining about something, and at the same time, you know, your metrics look like why are, they shouldn't be complaining. You should doubt the metrics. And an early example of this was we had metrics that showed that our customers were waiting, I think less than I don't know, 60 seconds when they called a 1-800 number to get, you know, phone customer service. The wait time was supposed to be less than 60 seconds. And, but we had a lot of complaints that it was longer than that. And anecdotally it seemed longer than that. Like, you know, I would call customer service myself. And so one day we're in a meeting, we're going through the WBR and the weekly business review, and we get to this metric in the deck, and the guy who leads customer service is to fit in the metric. And I said, okay, let's call picked up the phone. And I dialed the 1-800 number and called customer service. And we just waited in silence. - What did it turn out to be, like a couple minutes? - Oh, it was really long. More than 10 minutes, I think. - Oh wow. - I mean it was many minutes. And so, you know, it dramatically made the point that something was wrong with the data collection. We weren't measuring the right thing. And that, you know, set off a whole chain of events where we started measuring it right. And that's an example by the way of truth telling, is like that's an uncomfortable thing to do. But you have to seek truth even when it's uncomfortable and you have to get people's attention and they have to buy into it, and they have to get energized around really fixing things. - So that speaks to the obsession with the customer experience. So one of the defining aspects of your approach to Amazon is just being obsessed with making customers happy. I think companies sometimes say that, but Amazon is really obsessed with that. I think there's something really profound to that, which is seeing the world through the eyes of the customer, like the customer experience, truly like being, that's using the product, that's enjoying the product. They like the subtle little things that make up their experience. Like how do you optimize those? - This is another really good and kind of deep question because there are big things that are really important to manage. And then there are small things internally in Amazon, we call them paper cuts. So we have, we're always working on the big things, like if you ask me, and most of the energy goes into the big things as it should. So, and you can identify the big things. And and I would encourage anybody if anybody listening to this as a entrepreneur, has a small business, whatever, you know, think about the things that are not going to change over 10 years. And those are probably the big things. So like I know in our retail business at Amazon, 10 years from now, customers are still gonna want low prices. I know they're still gonna want fast delivery. And I just know they're still gonna want big selection. So it's impossible to imagine a scenario where 10 years from now I say, where a customer says, I love Amazon, I just wish the prices were a little higher. Or I love Amazon, I just wish you delivered a little more slowly. So when you identify the big things, you can tell they're worth putting energy into because they're stable in time. Okay, but you're asking about something a little different, which is in every customer experience, there are those big things. And by the way, it's astonishingly hard to focus even on just the big things. So even though they're obvious, they're really hard to focus on. But in addition to that, there are all these little tiny customer experience deficiencies. And we call those paper cuts and we make long lists of them. And then we have dedicated teams that go fix paper cuts because the teams working on the big issues never get to the paper cuts and they never work their way down the list to get to, they're working on big things as they should and as you want them to. And so you need special teams who are charged with fixing paper cuts. - Well, where would you put, on the paper cuts spectrum, the buy now with one click button, which is I think pretty genius. So to me like, okay, my interaction with things I love on the internet, there's things I do a lot. I may be representing regular human, I would love for those things to be frictionless. For example, booking airline tickets. Just saying, but you know, it's buying a thing with one click, making that experience frictionless, intuitive, all aspects of that. Like that just fundamentally makes my life better. Not just in terms of efficiency, in terms of some kind of- - Cognitive load. - Yeah, cognitive load and inner peace and happiness. First of all, buying stuff isn't a pleasant experience. Having enough money to buy a thing and then buying it is a pleasant experience. And like having pain around that is somehow just you're ruining a beautiful experience. And I guess all I'm saying as a person who loves good ideas, is that a paper cut, a solution to a paper cut? - Yes. So it's probably, that particular thing is probably a solution to a number of paper cuts. So if you go back and look at our order pipeline and how people shopped on Amazon, before we invented 1-click shopping, there were a whole, there was more friction. There was a whole series of paper cuts and that invention eliminated a bunch of paper cuts. And I think you're absolutely right by the way, that there, when you come up with something like 1-click shopping, again, this is like so ingrained in people now, I'm impressed that you even notice it. I mean, most people- - Every time I click the button. - I just, surge of happiness. - This, there is in the perfect invention for the perfect moment, in the perfect context, there is real beauty. - Yeah. - It is actual beauty. And it feels good. It's emotional, it's emotional for the inventor, it's emotional for the team that builds it. It's emotional for the customer. It's a big deal. And you can feel those things. - But to keep coming up with that idea, with those kinds of ideas, I guess is the the day one thinking effort. - Yeah, and you need a big group of people who feel that kind of satisfaction with creating that kind of beauty. - There's a lot of books written about you. There's a book Invent and Wander where Walter Isaacson does an intro. It's mostly collective writings of yours. I've read that. I also recommend people check out the Founders Podcast. That covers you a lot and it does different analysis of different business advice you've given over the years. I bring all that up because I saw that there, I mentioned that you said that books are an antidote for short attention spans. And I forget how it was phrased, but that when you were thinking about the Kindle, that you are thinking about how technology changes us. Yeah. - We co-evolve with our tools. So, you know, we invent new tools and then our tools change us. - Which is fascinating to think about. - It goes in a circle. - And there's some aspect, you know, even just inside business where you don't just make the customer happy, but you also have to think about like where is this going to take humanity if you zoom out a bit. - A hundred percent. And you know, you can feel in your brain, brains are plastic, and you can feel your brain getting reprogrammed. I remember the first time this happened to me was when Tetris, it first came on the scene. I'm sure you've had, anybody who's been a game player has this experience where you close your eyes to lay down to go to sleep and you see all the little blocks moving. And you can, you're kind of rotating them in your mind and you can just tell as you walk around the world that you have rewired your brain to play Tetris. And, but that happens with everything. And so, you know, one of the, I think we still have yet to see the full repercussions of this, I fear. But I think one of the things that we've done online, you know, and largely because of social media is we have trained our brains to be really good at processing super short form content. And, you know, your podcast flies in the face of this. You know, you do these long format things and reading books do too. Reading books is a long format thing. And we all do more of if you, if something is convenient, we do more of it. And so when you make tools, you know that we carry around a little, we carry around in our pocket a phone. And one of the things that phone does for the most part is it is an attention shortening device because most of the things we do on our phone shorten our attention spans. And I'm not even gonna say we know for sure that that's bad, but I do think it's happening. That's one of the ways we're co-evolving with that tool. But I think it's important to spend some of your time and some of your life doing long attention span things. - Yeah, I think you've spoken about the value in your own life of focus, of singular focus on a thing for prolonged periods of time. And that's certainly what books do and that's certainly what that piece of technology does. But I bring all that up to ask you about another piece of technology, AI that has the potential to have a various trajectories to have an impact on human civilization. How do you think AI will change us? - You're talking about you know, generative AI, large language models, things like ChatGPT and its soon successors, and these are incredibly powerful technologies. To believe otherwise is to bury her head in the sand, soon to be even more powerful. It's interesting to me that that large language models in their current form are not inventions, they're discoveries. You know, the telescope was an invention, but looking through it at Jupiter, knowing that it had moons was a discovery. My God, it has moons. And that's what Galileo did. And so this is closer on that spectrum of invention. You know, we know exactly what happens with a 787. It's an engineered object. We designed it, we know how it behaves. We don't want any surprises. Large language models are much more like discoveries. We're constantly getting surprised by their capabilities. They're not really engineered objects. Then you know, you have this debate about whether they're gonna be good for humanity or bad for humanity. You know, even specialized AI could be very bad for humanity. I mean, you know, just regular machine learning models that can make you know, certain weapons of war that could be incredibly destructive are very powerful. And they're not general AIs, they're just, they could just be very smart weapons. And so we have to think about all of those things. I'm very optimistic about this. So even in the face of all this uncertainty, my own view is that these powerful tools are much more likely to help us and save us even than they are to unbalance, hurt us, and destroy us. I think you know, we humans have a lot of ways of, we can make ourselves go extinct. You know, these things may help us not do that. You know, so they may actually save us. So the people who are you know, overly concerned, in my view, overly concerned. It's a valid debate. I think that they may be missing part of the equation, which is how helpful they could be in making sure we don't destroy ourselves. I don't know if you saw the movie Oppenheimer, but to me, first of all, I loved the movie and I thought the best part of the movie is this bureaucrat played by Robert Downey Jr. who you know, some of the people I've talked to think that's the most boring part of the movie. I thought it was the most fascinating because what's going on here is you realize we have invented these awesome, destructive, powerful technologies called nuclear weapons and they're managed and you know, we humans are, we're not really capable of wielding those weapons. We're, you know, that's what he represented in that movie is here's this guy who is just, he wrongly thinks, he's like being so petty. He thinks that he said something, that Oppenheimer said something bad to Einstein about him. They didn't talk about him at all, as you find out in the final scene of the movie. And yet he spent his career trying to be vengeful and petty. And that's the problem. We as a species are not really sophisticated enough and mature enough to handle these technologies. And so, and by the way, before you get to general AI and the possibility of AI having agency and there's a lot of things would have to happen, but there's so much benefit that's gonna come from these technologies in the meantime, even before they're, you know, general AI in terms of better medicines and better tools to develop more technologies, and so on. I think it's an incredible moment to be alive and to witness the transformations that are gonna happen. How quickly will happen no one knows. But over the next 10 years and 20 years, I think we're gonna see really remarkable advances. And I personally am very excited about it. - First of all, really interesting to say that it's discoveries that it's true that we don't know the limits of what's possible with the current language models. - We don't. - And like it could be a few tricks and hacks here and there that that open doors to whole entire new possibilities. - We do know that humans are doing something different from these models in part because you know, we're so power efficient. You know, the human brain does remarkable things and it does it on about 20 watts of power. And you know, the AI techniques we use today use many kilowatts of power to do equivalent tasks. So there's something interesting about the way the human brain does this and also we don't need as much data. So, you know, like self-driving cars are, they have to drive billions and billions of miles to try to learn how to drive. And you know, your average 16-year-old figures it out with many fewer miles. So there are still some tricks I think that we have yet to learn. I don't think we've learned the last trick. I don't think it's just a question of scaling things up, but what's interesting is that just scaling things up, and I put just in quotes because it's actually hard to scale things up, but just scaling things up also appears to pay huge dividends. - Yeah, and there's some more nuanced aspect about human beings that's interesting. If it's able to accomplish like being truly original and novel to you know, large language models, being able to come up with some truly new ideas. That's one. And the other one is truth. It seems that large language models are very good at sounding like they're saying a true thing, but they don't require or often have a grounding in sort of a mathematical truth. It can just, it basically is a very good bullshitter. So if there's not enough data, if there's not enough sort of data in the training data about a particular topic, it's just going to concoct accurate sounding narratives, which is a very fascinating problem to try to solve. How do you get language models to infer what is true and not to sort of introspect? - Yeah, they need to be taught to say I don't know more often. - Yeah. - And I know of several humans who could be taught that as well. - Sure. - And then the other stuff, because you're still a bit involved in the Amazon side with the AI things, the other open question is what kind of products are created from this? - Oh, so many. - Yeah. - I mean, you know, just to, we have Alexa and Echo and Alexa has you know, hundreds of millions of installed base, you know, inputs. And so there's, you know, there's Alexa everywhere and guess what Alexa is about to get a lot smarter. - Yeah. - And so that's really you know, from a product point of view, that's super exciting. - There's so many opportunities there. - So many opportunities. Shopping assistant, you know, like all that stuff is amazing. And AWS you know, we're building Titan, which is our foundational model. We're also building Bedrock, which our corporate clients at AWS, our enterprise clients, they want to be able to use these powerful models with their own corporate data Without accidentally contributing their corporate data to that model. And so those are the tools we're building for them with Bedrock. So there's tremendous opportunity here. - Yeah, the security, the privacy, all those things are fascinating of how to, 'cause so much value can be gained by training on private data that you want to keep the secure. It's a fascinating technical problem. - Yes. This is a very challenging technical problem and it's one that we're you know, making progress on and dedicated to solving for our customers. - Do you think there will be a day when humans and robots maybe Alexa have a romantic relationship? Like in the movie Her. - Well, I mean, I think- - I'm just brainstorming products here. - If you look at the spectrum of human variety and what people like you know, sexual variety. - Yes. - You know, there are people who like everything. So the answer to your question has to be yes. - Okay. - I don't know how- - I guess I'm asking when? - I don't know how widespread that will be. - All right. - But it will happen. - I was just asking when for a friend, but it's all right. Moving on. Next question. What's a perfectly productive day in the life of Jeff Bezos? You're one of the most productive humans in the world. - Well, I first of all, I get up in the morning and I putter. I like have a coffee. - Can you define putter? - Just like I slowly move around. I'm not as productive as you might think I am. I mean, 'cause I do believe in wandering and I sort of I, you know, I read my phone for a while. I read newspapers for a while. I chat with Lauren, I drink my first coffee. So I kind of, I move pretty slowly in the first couple of hours. I get up early just naturally. And then, you know, I exercise most days and most days it's not that hard for me. Some days it's really hard and I do it anyway. I don't want to you know, and it's painful. And I'm like why am I here and I don't want to. - Why am I here at the gym? - Why am I here at the gym? Why don't I do something else? You know, it's not always easy. - What's your social motivation in those moments? - I know that I'll feel better later if I do it. And so like the real source of motivation, I can tell the days when I skip it, I'm not quite as alert. I don't feel as good. And then there's harder motivations. It's longer term, you want to be healthy as you age, you know, you want health span, you want, ideally, you know, you want to be healthy and moving around when you're 80 years old, you know, and so there's a lot of, but that kind of motivation is so far in the future. It can be very hard to work in the second. So thinking about the fact I'll feel better in about four hours if I do it now. I'll have more energy for the rest of my day and so on and so on. - What's your exercise routine? Just to linger on that. How much do you curl? I mean, what are we talking about here? That's all I do at the gym. So I just- - My routine, you know, on a good day, I do about half an hour of cardio and I do about 45 minutes of weightlifting, resistance training of some kind, mostly weights. I have a trainer who you know, I love who pushes me, which is really helpful. You know, I'll be like, he'll say Jeff, you think you could, can we go up on that weight a little bit? And I'll think about it? And I'll be like no, I don't think so. And he'll look at me and say yeah, I think you can. And of course he's right. - Yeah, of course, of course. - So it's cool to have somebody push you a little bit. - But almost every day you do that? - I do, almost every day. I do a little bit of cardio and a little bit of weightlifting and I rotate. I do a pulling day and a pushing day and a leg day. It's all pretty standard stuff. - So puttering, coffee, gym. - Puttering, coffee, gym, and then work. - Work. What's work look like? What are the productive hours look like for you? - I, you know, so a couple years ago I left as the CEO of Amazon. And I have never worked harder in my life. I am working so hard and I'm mostly enjoying it. But there are also some very painful days. Most of my time is spent on Blue Origin and I've been, I'm so deeply involved here now for the last couple of years. And in the big, I love it and the small, there's all the frustrations that come along with everything. You know, we're trying to get to rate manufacturing as we talked about. That's super important. We'll get there. We just hired a new CEO, a guy I've known for close to 15 years now, a guy named Dave Limp, who I love. He's amazing. You know, so we're super lucky to have Dave and you know, we're going to, you're gonna see us move faster there. But, so my day of work, you know, reading documents, having meetings, sometimes in person, sometimes over Zoom, depends on where I am. It's all about you know, the technology. It's about the organization. It's about you know, I'm very, I have architecture and technology meetings almost every day on various subsystems inside the vehicle, inside the engines. It's super fun for me. My favorite part of it is the technology. My least favorite part of it is you know, building organizations and so on. That's important, but it's also my least favorite part. So, you know, that's why they call it work. You don't always get to do what you wanna do. - How do you achieve time where you can focus and truly think through problems? - I do little thinking retreats. So for, this is not the only, I can do that all day long. I'm very good at focusing. I'm very good at you know, I don't keep to a strict schedule. Like my meetings often go longer than I plan for them to because I believe in wandering, My perfect meeting starts with a crisp document. So the document should be written with such clarity that it's like angels singing from on high. I like a crisp document and a messy meeting. And so the meeting is about like asking questions that nobody knows the answer to and trying to like wander your way to a solution. And because like when that happens just right, it makes all the other meetings worthwhile. It feels good. It has a kind of beauty to it. It has an aesthetic beauty to it. And you get real breakthroughs in meetings like that. - Can you actually describe the crisp document? Like this is one of the legendary aspects of Amazon, of the way you approach meetings? Is this the six page memo? Maybe first describe the process of running a meeting with memos. - Meetings at Amazon and at Blue Origin are unusual. When we get new, when new people come in, like a new executive joins, they're a little taken aback sometimes because a typical meeting, we'll start with a six page narratively structured memo and we do study hall. For 30 minutes, we sit there silently together in the meeting and read. - I love this. - Take notes in the margins. And then we discuss. And the reason, by the way we do study, you could say I would like everybody to read these memos in advance, but the problem is people don't have time to do that. And they end up coming to the meeting having only skimmed the memo or maybe not read it at all. And they're trying to catch up. And they're also bluffing like they were in college having pretended to do the reading. - Yeah, Exactly. - It's better just to carve out the time for people - And do it together. - So now we're all on the same page. We've all read the memo and now we can have a really elevated discussion. And this is so much better from having a slideshow presentation, you know, a PowerPoint presentation of some kind where that has so many difficulties. But one of the problems is PowerPoint is really designed to persuade. It's kind of a sales tool. And internally the last thing you want to do is sell. You want to, you're again, you're truth seeking. You're trying to find truth. And the other problem with PowerPoint is it's easy for the author and hard for the audience. And a memo is the opposite. It's hard to write a six page memo. A good six page memo might take two weeks to write. You have to write it, you have to rewrite it, you have to edit it, you have to talk to people about it. They have to poke holes in it for you. You write it again, it might take two weeks. So the author, it's really a very difficult job, but for the audience it's much better. So you can read a half hour and you know, there are little problems with PowerPoint presentations too. You know, senior executives interrupt with questions halfway through the presentation. That question's gonna be answered on the next slide, but you never got there. If you read the whole memo in advance, you know, I often write lots of questions that I have in the margins of these memos, and then I go cross them all out because by the time I get to the end of the memo, they've been answered. That's why I save all that time. You also get, you know, if the person who's preparing the memo, we talked earlier about you know, group think and you know, the fact that I go last in meetings and that you don't want you know, your ideas to kind of pollute the meeting prematurely. You know, the author of the memos has kind of got to be very vulnerable. They've gotta put all their thoughts out there. And they've got to go first. But that's great 'cause it makes 'em really good. And so, and you get to see their real ideas and you're not trampling on them accidentally in a big, you know, PowerPoint presentation. - What's that feel like when you've authored a thing and then you're sitting there and everybody's reading your thing, you're like- - I think it's mostly terrifying. - Yeah. Like maybe in a good way? - I think it's- - Like purifying. - I think it's terrifying in a productive way. - Yeah. - But I think it's emotionally a very nerve wracking experience. - Is there a art science to the writing of the six page memo or just writing in general to you? - I mean, it's really got to be a real memo. So it means you know, paragraphs have topic sentences, like it's verbs and nouns. You can't, that's the other problem with PowerPoints, they're often just bullet points and you can hide a lot of sloppy thinking behind bullet points. When you have to write in complete sentences with narrative structure, it's really hard to hide sloppy thinking. So it does, it forces the author to be at their best. And so you're getting somebody's, they're getting somebody's really their best thinking. And then you don't have to spend a lot of time trying to tease that thinking out of the person. And you've got it from the very beginning. So it really saves you time in the long run. - So that part is crisp and then the rest is messy, crisp document. - Yeah, so you don't wanna pretend that the discussion should be crisp. There's, you know, most meetings, you're trying to solve a really hard problem. There's a different kind of meeting, which we call weekly business reviews or business reviews that may be weekly or monthly or daily, whatever they are. But these business review meetings, that's usually for incremental improvement. And you're like looking at a series of metrics, every time it's the same metrics. Those meetings can be very efficient. They can start on time and end on time. - So we're about to run out of time, which is a good time to ask about the 10,000 year clock. That's what I'm known for, is the humor. Okay. Can you explain what the 10,000 year clock is? - 10,000 year clock is a physical clock of monumental scale. It's about 500 feet tall. It's inside a mountain in west Texas in a chamber that's about 12 feet in diameter and 500 feet tall. 10,000 year clock is a idea conceived by brilliant guy named Danny Hillis way back in the '80s. The idea is to build a clock as a symbol for long-term thinking. And you can kind of just very conceptually think of the 10,000 year clock as it you know, it ticks once a year. It chimes once you know, every a hundred years. And the cuckoo comes out once every a thousand years. So it just sort of slows everything down. And it's a completely mechanical clock. It is designed to last 10,000 years with no human intervention. So the material choices and everything else. It's in a remote location, both to protect it, but also so that visitors have to kind of make a pilgrimage. The idea is that over time, this will take hundreds of years, but over time it will take on the patina of age and then it will become a symbol for long-term thinking that will actually, hopefully get humans to extend their thinking horizons. And my view that's really important as we have become, as a species, as a civilization more powerful, you know, we're really affecting the planet now. We're really affecting each other. We have weapons of mass destruction, we have all kinds of things where we can really hurt ourselves. And the problems we create can be so large. You know, the unintended consequences of some of our actions like climate change, putting carbon in the atmosphere is a perfect example. That's an unintended consequence of the industrial revolution that a lot of benefits from it. But we've also got this side effect that is very detrimental. We need to be, we need to start training ourselves to think longer term. Long-term thinking is a giant lever. You can literally solve problems if you think long-term that are impossible to solve if you think short term. And we aren't really good at thinking long-term as you know, it's not really, we're kind of, you know, five years is a tough timeframe for most institutions to think past. And we probably need to stretch that to 10 years and 15 years and 20 years and 25 years. And we do a better job for our children or our grandchildren if we could stretch those thinking horizons. And so the clock is, in a way, it's an art project, it's a symbol. And if it ever has any power to influence people to think longer term, that won't happen for hundreds of years. But we have to, you know, we're gonna build it now and let it accrue the patina of age. - Do you think humans will be here when the clock runs out? Here on earth? - I think so. But you know, the United States won't exist. Like whole civilizations rise and fall. 10,000 years is so long. Like no nation state has ever survived for anywhere close to 10,000 years. - And the increasing rate of progress makes that even- - Even less likely so. Do I think humans will be here? Yes. What, you know, how will we have changed ourselves and what will we be and so on and so on. I don't know, but I think we'll be here. - On that grand scale, a human life feels tiny. Do you ponder your own mortality? Are you afraid of death? - No, I'm you know, I used to be afraid of death. I did. I like I remember as a young person being kind of like very scared of mortality, like didn't want to think about it and so on. And always had a big, and as I've gotten older, I'm 59 now. As I've gotten older, somehow that fear has sort of gone away. I don't, you know, I would like to stay alive for as long as possible, but I'd like to be, I'm really more focused on health span. I want to be healthy. I want that square wave. I want to you know, this I wanna be healthy, healthy, healthy, and then gone. I don't want the long decay. And I'm curious, I wanna see how things turn out. You know, I'd like to be here. I love my family and my close friends and I want to, I'm curious about them and I wanna see, so I have a lot of reasons to stay around, but it's mortality doesn't have have that effect on me that it did you know, maybe when I was in my 20s. - Well Jeff, thank you for creating Amazon, one of the most incredible companies in history. And thank you for trying your best to make humans and multi-planetary species expanding out into our solar system, maybe beyond, to meet the aliens out there. And thank you for talking today. - Well, Lex, thank you for doing your part to lengthen our attention spans. Appreciate that very much. - Thanks for listening to this conversation with Jeff Bezos. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from Jeff Bezos himself. \"Be stubborn on vision, but flexible on the details.\" Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time."

      "transcript": "[Music] [Music] [Music] please please welcome Andrew Ross sorin and his guest founder and executive chairman of Amazon and founder of blue origin Jeff Bezos Jeffrey Bezos everybody Jeff thank you so much for being here uh we always try to save the best for last and uh we couldn't be more thrilled for you to be here um I said it at the beginning of the day um and I'll say it again in front of you Jeff Jeff is one of the world's most successful entrepreneurs uh we talk a lot about people we've talked about it all day about people of consequence on this stage and there's no question uh that Jeff has changed the way we live really um and it's rare to be able to say that about anybody um in 1994 he founded Amazon uh which started as an online book seller you know the story right out of his garage in Seattle today Amazon's one of the most five valuable companies in America now he's focused uh far beyond Earth to outer space through his company blue origin he's racing to the moon and then to Mars his new Glenn heavy lift booster rocket expected to launch any day now any day now and uh meanwhile back here on Earth his Bezos Earth fund granting $2 billion so far and of course he also owns the stored Washington Post which has put him in the headlines in recent weeks as well it punches above its weight in that regard um and we're going to talk about it we're going to talk about all of that and more um and in fact what I want to do if you'd indulge me is actually start there yeah with the Washington Post and the reason I want to do that um because I think as we all saw the election play out and we saw the decision uh not to endorse a presidential candidate prior to that it became I think a microcosm of so many different things in our society uh that decision it became a r Shack test for people and their politics it became uh a question about trust in the media about influence about business interests and so many other other things and so I was hoping maybe just to sort of help us with this story which we all read about if you could just in your own words take us back to the two weeks before the election when that decision was made and what happened and what was going through your mind at that time well it was the time when uh for some number of years about that time when the Washington Post would uh you know make an editorial decision and endorse a presidential candidate for many decades the post uh very studiously did not endorse presidential candidates the the kind of founder of the modern post guy named Eugene Meyer whose words are still inscribed on the in the lobby as you walk in was against the idea because he thought an independent newspaper shouldn't be uh endorsing presidential candidates and so they didn't do it after Watergate the post started uh endorsing presidential candidates and so we're talking about this in that time frame um it hadn't come up before and um you know we just decided that you know it wasn't going to help for well first of all it wasn't going to influence the election either way you know there we we didn't believe there's no evidence that newspaper endorsements influence elections there no independent voter in Pennsylvania at that time was going to say oh is that what the Washington Post thinks well then I'll do that so that wasn't going to happen and at the same time um you know we're struggling with the issue that all uh traditional media is struggling with which is a very difficult and significant loss of trust and you know the trust surveys have been done for many decades now and the media has been going down in those surveys four decades they've always been able to hang on to the one you know small positive that they're always above Congress and this year they lost even that um falling below Congress which is not easy to achieve um Congress was thrilled by the way not to be at the very bottom of the list and so we just decided that um the the pluses of doing this were very small and it added to the perception of bias you know the newspapers and media in general if they are going to try and be objective and independent they have to pass the same requirement that a voting machine does they have to count the votes accurately and people have to believe that they count the votes accurately both requirements are just as important for a voting machine and media is similar and there is a there's a strong per not all of it is the media's Fault there's a lot of uh a lot of external factors involved too but where we can do something we should okay let me ask you and you you know that there was blowback uh I just want to read you this is Marty Baron who was your former editor of that paper he said this is is cowardice with democracy as its casualty David remnick said if Jeff Bezos had said two years ago that he thought the editorial page should get rid of endorsements all of them you could argue the case one way or another but he was effectively suggesting that given this scenario with the timing of it look at if I had had the pressions to think about this topic at all two years before that would have been better for perception reasons but uh in fact we made this decision uh it was the right decision I'm proud of the decision we made and it was far from cowardly because we knew there would be blowback and we did the right thing anyway okay so let me ask you about that though there was blowback I think uh 250,000 people canceled their subscription so did you think when you were doing this that some people were going to say that actually creates less Trust in Media I mean right part part of it was it was it was aimed at creating more Trust in Media and at the same time clearly there were other people saying maybe there's less Trust no I don't follow that logic you don't mm and so what did you were you surprised at the not really we knew there would we knew that this was going to be uh perceived in a very big way as I said you know these things punch above their weight and we worried about that at all I mean this you can't worry you can't do the wrong thing because you're worried about uh bad PR or whatever it is you want to call it so you this is this was the right decision we made the right decision um I'm very proud of the decision so let me just uh ask you ask you one related question um which is this um you said in your um opinion piece about all of this I thought it was fascinating um you said when it comes to the appearance of conflict I am the not not the ideal owner no I'm a terrible owner of the post for the post from the point of view of appearance of conflict I there is you know probably not a single day goes by where some Amazon executive or some blue origin executive or some Bezos Earth fund leader right isn't meeting with a government official somewhere and so there are always going to be appearances of conflict and is that a pure newspaper owner who only owned a newspaper and did nothing else would probably be from that point of view a much better owner now the advantage I bring to the post is you know when when we uh you know when they need Financial Resources I'm available kind of uh you know I'm like that I'm the doting parent in that regard um I think embedded underneath the the fundamental question is this and the wall stre Journal wrote about at the New York Times I've been writing about it it's whether and this was I think the question that people had which was whether you had any worry in your mind about your other businesses about uh Trump uh and whether he would ultimately Target an Amazon or Target a blue origin as retaliation against negative coverage given that you had lived through that no I don't think so that was certainly not in my mind and I'm also uh very aware that the post covers all presidents very aggressively is going to continue to cover all presidents very aggressively and uh you know the endorsement or non-endorsement isn't going to you did not think that was going to change miss a drop in the bucket anything so no won't change anything if he likes you he likes you and if he doesn't like you he's not going to like you anyway well I don't know I mean that that's a different question um but you if we're talking about Trump I think it's very interesting I'm I'm actually very optimistic this time around that uh we're going to see I'm very hopeful about this his he have a lot of energy around reducing regulation and my point of view if I can help him do that I'm going to help him because we do have too much regulation in this country this country is so set up right to grow by the way all of our problems all of our economic problems like if you look at the the deficit and I mean you know the debt the national debt and how gigantic it is as a portion of GDP these are real problems and they're real long-term problems and the way you get out of them them is by outgrowing them you're going to get you're going to you're going to solve the problem of the national debt by making a smaller percentage of GDP not by shrinking the national debt but by growing the GDP you have to grow the denominator and that means you have to grow GDP at you know 3 four 5% a year and you know let the national debt grows slower than that if you can do that this is a very manageable problem so we need a growth orientation in this country this is the most important thing a growth mindset and we are the luckiest country in the world we have all these natural resources including energy Independence we have the best risk Capital system in the world by far so you know people get confused about why does the United States have so much Venture success so much entrepreneurial success why are the big tech companies here and not somewhere else what's really going on with all this dynamism in this country compared to what we see around elsewhere in the world and the prime there a bunch of reasons for that but the biggest one eight of 10 points there is that we have better risk Capital it's not the banking system you know we have a good banking system but so does Europe right what's different here is that you can get you can raise you know $50 million of seed Capital to to do something that only has a 10% chance of working that's crazy and but the people who are giving you that seed Capital know that the that their expected value is still positive in many cases or they're at least gambling that that's true that risk Capital system that we have in this country is turning out to be very hard for other countries to duplicate so we have that we have you know we speak English and English is turning into the linga Fran of the whole World it say you know there's so many advantages here but we are burdened by excessive permiting and regulation you can't build a bridge and all these things you know what they are we see these examples all the time we need to be able to build solar fields and everything your optimistic I'm super about this President and the reason because very optimistic that that President Trump is serious about this regulatory agenda and I I think he's going to I think he has a good chance of succeeding what about the idea that he thinks that the Press is the enemy well I I I think he I'm going to try to talk him out of that idea I don't think the Press is the enemy and I don't think you know he he's also I you've probably grown in the last eight years he has too like it's you know this is not the case the Press is not the enemy I hope you're right I hope I'm right too have you let's go persuade him of this no let's but you and I should go let's go talk to him if we could try I I really don't I I think that this is absolutely um uh he I I don't think he's going to see it the same way but maybe I'll be wrong was that always your your always your thought by the way what I've seen so far is that um he is calmer than he was first time and more confident more settled um let me ask one related question that I want to actually get into space but it actually is an interesting segue to space because we were talking earlier this morning to Sam Alman about Elon Musk um and Elon musk's relationship with the president interestingly and there's been a lot of questions about whether there could be the possibility that Elon given his proximity would make things difficult for people who are his competitors Elon in the space context is your biggest competitor yes does this concern you well they're certainly very able competitors I mean this is an arena where um I have the oh no no I know he's a great competitor no I'm saying does it concern you his proximity no I was headed there oh but I'm just saying there they're certainly very good competitors and you know uh no doubt about that um uh I don't I I I take it face value um what has been said which is that you know he is not going to use his political power to Advantage his own companies or to disadvantage his competitors I think that it face value again I could be wrong about that but I I think it could be true I think he probably is trying to uh you know I think this department of government efficiency and that he and VC are helping Trump with and so on again I'd like to take I have a lot of I've had a lot of success in life not being cynical and I've very rarely been taken advantage of as a result it's happened a couple of times but not very often and I think that cynicism you know why be cynical about that let's go into it hoping that the statements that have been made are correct that this is going to be done you know above board in the public interest and if that turns out to be naive well then we'll see but I I actually think it's going to be great I'm hoping I'm I'm glad you could address it uh it's something I think we all want to know one by the way before I even get to space uh Washington Post question just because there's a lot of media people here um the big plan to uh save or fix the Washington Post is you've been a great innovator as it comes to Amazon and everything else do do you have a a big idea about how the post is going to change newspapers are going to change I have I have a bunch of ideas and and and I'm working on that right now and I have a couple of small inventions uh there so we'll see I you know we saved the Washington Post once this will be the second time I would um I'd like to it was saved let's see 2013 so 11 years ago it took a couple of years it made money for six or seven years after that in the last few years it's lost money again and um it it needs to be put back on a good footing again and um the first time we did it by transitioning away from advertising to subscriptions and also away from being a local paper to being a national paper and there are many more details to it but that was the basic formula that was used and it was very successful and uh we have a few other ideas so stay tuned we'll see okay um here's my question to you about space which is I think a lot of us watched you this was weeks just weeks after you stepped down as a CEO of of Amazon uh you went aboard new Shepard uh as its first crew flight um and I remember watching it on TV just like everybody else this is 2001 and I know this is something you wanted to do literally since you were a kid I mean I went back and looked there were articles and letters and people who who said that when you were a child you were talking about this and so I was just curious if you could just take us back to that morning and what that felt like because you have now put all of your eggs now in the space basket um and and what that what that was like and and how that might have even shifted your thinking about this you put all my eggs in the space basket well you mean you have a huge investment in space yes but it's not all my eggs not all of them yeah no I I still have a huge investment in Amazon I still spent a lot of time there too I've I've actually never worked harder the the this retirement thing I've turned out to be extremely lame at um and so I'm I'm uh you know I'm waking up every morning and and doing meetings from 9 to 7 and reading documents and uh I most of it is blue origin but quite a bit of it is still Amazon too I um uh that morning um we're going to space and uh and I'll tell you about the overview effect which everyone goes we've now sent 6% new Shepherd is our tourism vehicle it takes people up in space the whole journey takes 11 minutes you're in space for 4 minutes um you go up above the Carmen line 100 kmers up you see the curvature of the Earth the thin limb of the Earth's atmosphere it truly is a lifechanging transformative thing every astronaut everybody who's ever been to space has felt this and it has a name it's called the overview effect um Jim level the uh Apollo 13 astronaut and uh uh and later moon walker has a beautiful quote um you know when he saw the Earth from space he looked back and said I realize um you don't go to heaven when you die you go to heaven when you're born and that's how beautiful this planet is and you may have seen uh William Shatner when he flew on new Shepherd and he came back he saw everything the Blackness and how it's there's the nothing and he described it as death and said look this is the one little pool of life that we in this entire solar system it's truly incredible and you get it is a profound uh experience that's hard to describe but that morning something else happened to me that is was very personal um we're getting ready to go at 4:45 in the morning and you know uh my whole family is there some close friends extended family 35 40 people there and by the way I'm going on the first human flight of this vehicle and uh so it's never flown people before um and my poor mother uh what's worse is I'm bringing my brother with me so uh it's me and my brother and we wake up getting ready to go to the launch site and and kind of you know we weren't really expected but everybody of course is awake and there to say goodbye but they thought they were saying goodbye forever and which was surprising to me I I wasn't expecting this but they were genuinely terrified for us and but it was paradoxically for my brother and and and me we it it felt really good to us because we got to see how loved we were and it was very you know my kids and my my sister and my mom and my dad and um these close friends it it's easy to know what's going on inside your own head it's easy to know that you love people it's not really it's not to know how much you're loved by others is not always as obvious and to so to see that concern was was very meaningful very emotional that was a kind of an unexpected the overview expect I talked to astronauts I knew I was going to in store for something special but it was very interesting to have that feeling from my family too did that change the way you've thought about everything you're doing with this with blue origin in terms of what this is all about you've said that the reason we've got to go to space in my view is to save Earth is that is that come from being up there and looking at that was that were for whatever reason since I'm a teenager and in fact there's a high school newspaper article my Miami Palmetto Senior High the they they wrote an article about my space plans which I would tell everyone who would stand still long enough about and um the those plans included um what I still think what I still working on which is moving all polluting industry off Earth and so my view but I know that sounds Fantastical so I I I I beg the Indulgence of this audience to bear with me for a moment but it's not Fantastical this is going to happen and we need to lower the cost of access to space low enough and that's what new Glenn our orbital vehicle is all about um that's the big super heavy launch vehicle that's so now it's literally on the pad now waiting for regulatory approval it needs its final regulatory approvals to to launch so we're very very close and uh if we can lower the costs enough and we will I mean it may take who knows how many years it will take but we can set up the preconditions where the Next Generation or the generation after that will be able to move pling industry off Earth and then this planet will be maintained as it should be and you know can kind of be can sort of think of a zoned residential and Light Industry and if you want to use large amounts of energy and large amounts of pollutants and so on you go do that off Earth and so we get the best of both we get to have this energy intensive civilization and use ever more energy per capita and get all the benefits that we get from that which are many by the way you don't want to go back in time and it's it's really important to think about you know when people talk about the good old days that is such an illusion you know that we're almost everything is better today than it was you know infant mortality is better you know Global illiteracy is better uh you know Global poverty is far better every things really are better today um there's one exception to that which is the natural world the natural world if you go back in time 500 years we had prestige oceans pristine Rivers pristine forests and that is uh you know that's part of the trade we've made is we're kind of you know we're we're using up the natural world here but space has infinite for all practical purposes Infinite Energy infinite raw materials so that's it's a very interesting philosophical choice because one of the things you're talking about trying to save the Earth and I was going to say that a number of other people including I think musk and others say that we need an escape hatch from Earth right we need to all move to Mars because Earth is not going to be saved do you do you see that no we have to save so so first of all there is no plan B we have to save Earth so we've sent robotic probes to all of the planets in this solar system this is the good one um and um and we must save it we cannot look we can live we can Cho how we want to live we could it is not impossible if you think about climate change and so on some of the issues that we Face here because of the way way we're doing things currently um you could imagine a world with enough technological sophistication where we can turn Earth into sort of a giant spaceship you know like air condition Fantastical no I know air no but I'm saying air conditioned planet and you know kind of pav the whole thing and turn it that that's a bad future we don't need to do that that turning Earth into you know take the whole thing and turning it into a human construct and destroying this natural ecosystem when it's so unique and such a gym that's not the right way to do it so we should move all that off Earth and and and we will because we won't do it the wrong way and you know why we won't because humans value Beauty and art I have a ranch in West Texas it's actually also where the launch site for the suborbital vehicle is the and on that ranch you can in many different places you can go and find uh uh you know arrowheads and ancient pottery and the son of the pottery is 7,000 years old and it is you know and that was a Hard Scrabble subsistence level life and that Pottery is decorated so here are these people who are in a desert environment scraping for water food and yet they're taking the time to paint their Pottery what does that tell you about our values and what we you know humans Value Beauty and art we're not going to destroy this planet um let me ask you two other related space questions I had the opportunity to go tour blue origin uh in the fall and one of the things that everybody down there talks about is this idea of going getting the moon and then using the moon in fact the phrase that one of your colleagues did was uh we're going to use the Moon the Moon is going to be like JFK uh the airport because no like JFK the airport because we're going to send stuff to the moon and then from the Moon then we're going to go to Mars we're it's like a pit stop on the along the way and I thought that was sort of a very interesting uh yeah there process there's a very strong argument to be made that the Moon is a good stepping stone to the rest of the solar system and the reason for that because of the moon is has a much much lower gravity level than the earth and because it has a lot of very important minerals and also water in the form of ice in the permanently shadowed creators at the poles of the Moon and ice can be uh uh converted water can be converted into hydrogen and oxygen which are happen to be the very best uh highest performing rocket propellants and so you can uh it takes if you to raise a kilogram of Mass from the Earth takes 28 times as much energy as raising that same kilogram from the moon so to the degree that you can get raw materials from the Moon which is again we're talking about a couple of generations in the future but to the degree that you can get raw materials from the Moon instead of from Earth those materials will allow you to build spaceships into fuel those spaceships and to build solar arrays and all these other things that you want to do but using lunar resources instead of Earth Resources and then it would provide a very convenient stepping stone to the rest of the solar system um Dave limp who DET tired uh to uh to run blue origin for you um as a CEO said apparently when he was interviewing with you he said Jeff is blue origin a hobby or a business yeah what did you tell them it's a business it's it's it's not a very good business yet we're investing no it'll I you know look I think it's going to be um I think it's going to be from a business point of view from a financial returns point of view I think it's going to be the best business that I've ever been involved in but it's going to take a while so bigger than Amazon yeah so let me ask you a different question which is I remember just being down there the scale of everything I wish I I wish you could all just go and see it is so remarkable you sort of look at the scale and you can't even understand understand what is happening around you it's sort of so hard to Fathom uh just the size of it all and it made me think um about confidence we were actually talking to Serena Williams earlier today about confidence and I was thinking to myself it's easy for her she just has to be the best in the world well but and but this is going to go to you too which is you know when you started Amazon that was a business that had to scale and you had to see the scale to work I remember for years I I was covering it I would be writing about when you were losing money left and right in center everyone thought this whole thing was crazy and the scale lost money for 11 years the scale of it it people think I thought it was insane yes and if you go down to Florida to Cape canaval and you see the scale of this thing you say to my God this is insane Tom broka interviewed me one time about Amazon's losses and he said he looked at me and he said do can Mr Bezos can you even spell profit and I said yes p r o p h e t so so where do you think that where do you think your confidence though comes from to create a business that requires such scale most people like to you know they take one foot and they put the other foot and then then they and they want to be able to see where they're going and I would argue with in in the case of Amazon in the case of space you can't see where I mean maybe you can see where you're going but a lot of people actually struggle to see it well I think I this first of all a very good question very interesting question and I'm not sure I know the right answer or maybe there are many answers so let's start with that but I one observation I would have is that I think it's generally human nature to overestimate risk and underestimate opportunity and so I think on rurs in general uh you know would be well advised to try and bias against that piece of human nature the risks are probably not as big as you perceive and the opportunities may be bigger than you perceive and so you're when you look at when you you say it's confidence but maybe it's just trying to compensate for that that um accepting that that's a human bias and trying to compensate against it the second thing I would point out is that you know thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy now when do you think you learned this though because you were doing this at a very young age I this is not something this is something maybe a wise and old man would say but I I I only say because I remember it's very early I remember watching I remember watching on 60 Minutes um this is maybe 1999 and at the end of the interview um they were asking asking you about whether this whole thing could work or not um and you said it is it it's not a fear that it can't work it's a fact that it might not work right that is true and no no but I remember I remember seeing that thinking and you just said it in the sort of matter OFA kind of way which is to say did you say to yourself there's a massive risk this is not really going to happen I to to raise the first million dollars of seed capital for Amazon so I I sold um 20% of the company a $5 million valuation I sold 20% of the company for a million dollars to 22 Angel Investors 50 roughly $50,000 each and I had to take 60 meetings so whatever you know roughly 40 of them said no and and a little 20 20 22 or so said yes and um it was the hardest thing I've ever done this was 1995 is 1995 and um the first question was what's the internet everybody wanted to know what the internet was and um and by the way the 40 NOS were hard-earned notes like they weren't just no they were me you know multiple meetings working really hard trying to get people to write that $50,000 check and the whole Enterprise could have been extinguished then and what I do remember in those meetings I would always tell people I thought there was a 70% chance they would lose their investment and I in in retrospect I think that might have been a little naive um but I thought but I think it was true in fact if anything I think I was giving myself better than better than the odds better than the real odds what do you think the real odds are in space with blue origin well blue origin is um H you know has doesn't have the same level of financing risk so you know because I can Finance blue origin um with my Amazon stock so it's it I think am blue origin has a lot of Runway blue origin is going to do some very amazing things here and and uh it's you know and by the way Amazon is doing amazing things I saw some of our announcements yesterday I hope but you know the the Nova foundational models are are truly incredible they're I you know it's there's a bunch of stuff going on the world is so interesting right now we're in multiple Golden Ages at once and you know I'm also very interested in robotics I'm I'm not doing that directly but I'm doing it I'm investing in a number of Robotics companies I'm a big believer in it that I I think there's never been a more extraordinary moment to be alive we're so lucky I want to go back to Amazon for second um well actually I want to go back you just mentioned the fundraising for Amazon the at the outset yes one of the things that I noticed recently um and you may you you'll infer why I'm even asking you this is throughout your whole career at Amazon it appears to me like you paid yourself about $80,000 a year in total yeah cash comp and never took additional equity in the company the entire time no I never did and I asked the comp Committee of the board not to give me any comp and I the my view was I was a Founder I had I already owned a significant amount of the company and I just didn't feel good about taking more I felt um I had plenty of incentive it was you know I owned you know more than 10% of the company you know more earlier you know before it was diluted by various things more than 20% of the company and it was I just felt how could I possibly need more incentive than owning such a you know most Founders own big chunks of the company they don't really need they're more like owner operators the way they increase their wealth is not by getting comp you know more Equity they just want to make the equity they have more valuable and uh and so I never I I just would have felt icky about it and uh it I really I'm actually very proud of that decision I I I sometimes wish that there were a um and maybe you can do this Andrew or maybe the Washington Post will do this but somebody needs to make a list where they rank people by how much wealth they've created for other people and so instead of the Forbes list it ranks you by your own wealth so you know Amazon's market cap is 2.3 trillion today I own about you know 200 billion is of it so if you take 2.3 billion and subtract out the piece I kept from myself then you know I've created something like 2.1 trillion of wealth for other people that should put me pretty high on some kind of list and uh and that's a better list you know what uh how much wealth have you created for other people you know people like Jensen Nvidia he's going to be very high on that list and uh that would be a pretty cool list somebody should do that list I think that is a very cool list how does that how does the idea of your own influence sit with you do you do you think about that do you appreciate that that you are one of the most powerful people in the world frankly given your connection to Amazon given what you're doing with blue origin given all the other things that you're investing in and can do the Washington Post you know I don't it's it's a fair question but I don't I don't think about it that way I don't wake up and think you know how am I going to exercise my power today you know um it's it's I wake up and follow my curiosity I've always been a Wanderer and uh I even organize our you know our I was on meetings this way I want crisp documents and messy meetings and I want the meetings to wander uh the only meeting I'm ever on time to is my first one because I won't finish a meeting until I'm really finished you the boss what about everybody else they have to wa for me but but that you know this is um uh you know it's but I and I actually would and I I try to teach like really wander in the meetings there's certain kinds of meetings that are like a weekly Business review or something where it's like a set pattern and you're going through it that can have an agenda and it can be very Crisp that's a different kind of meeting but most of the meetings that are useful we do we do these six-page memos we do half hour study hall we read them and then and then we have a messy discussion so I like a the memo should be like Angel seeing from high it's so clear and beautiful and then the meeting could be messy how messy can it be and I completely no no I asked that because culturally right now and there's so many people in the room here who go to meetings and we don't know how messy they can be no I I mean that because you don't know whether you really can raise your hand and say this totally this idea is completely insane and should not be happen in fact I am very skeptical if the meeting is not messy one time it doesn't happen very often because it's kind of verboten um at Amazon and but it I could I could tell in the meeting that that the team had rehearsed the meeting that happens and I would and I I I could just feel it like I could you can tell the little tiny cues and I I turned to them said did you guys rehearse this meeting and they were like uh yes I was like don't do that again you don't need to because here's what maybe you would rehearse a sales meeting right if you're going you know if if you're going to go visit you know a a customer and you're trying to sell them a new product or something maybe you want to have all your ducks in a row and you want to put your best foot forward but that's what people do you're seeking truth not not a pitch I don't want to be pitched and you don't want any of your senior Executives to be pitched you want and that's why messy is good and and uh and you also want to be early it's like you don't want the whole thing to be figured out and then presented to you right like you want to be part of the SAU Mage making like show me the ugly bits like and I always ask you know are there any dissenting opinions on the team you know who what you know I want to try to get to the controversy like what let's make this meeting messy Help Me Help Me Make It messy um how hard was it for you to leave Amazon I go last too oh you yes I've heard about this everybody we try to go in kind of seniority order so the most Junior person goes first the most senior person goes last and it helps with group think because if you say what's going to happen What happens if you have already come up with your view though well I don't want to torture people so in that rare case where I actually know that nothing can change my mind I will just say look guys nothing here is going to change my mind so like let's not waste a lot of time I don't want to it shouldn't be a charade um but in but that those aren't that's a very rare case I've actually personally very easy to influence something I've realized later in my life over just maybe starting 10 years ago or so I realized I'm a very easy person to influence I changed my mind a lot you know people talk to me and I taken the information and I to change I can be easily but a couple of percent of the time no force in the world can move me because I'm so sure of something there were you know I I can't tell you how many people tried to talk me out of fulfillment by Amazon as an example and I just I just knew and I was like you guys you w never talk me out of this we're going to do this I will do this through sheer force of will if need be do you think that you have that this is actually um something that I think a lot of people contend with do you think you have to project confidence no I I don't I you know I've gotten um well I guess a little bit of a personal story way but I have gotten um more intimate I would say in the last you know as I've gotten older so maybe the last 10 or 15 years and uh my my in my my upbringing I have you know I have really supportive family and um but in our family there were some unspoken rules which I think probably most families have unspoken rules of one kind or another and in mine uh all the positive emotions were allowed optimism you know happiness Joy uh and but only really the only negative emotion that was kind of tolerated in that unspoken family Dynamic and only occasionally was anger sadness fear uh anxiety these things were looked down on and that's probably in this in a scheme of things kind of probably pretty helpful for founding a company you know it's like you you probably mostly want to be focused on positive things anyway um and you need optimism you know without optimism optimism and energy I don't know how how some glum Eeyore type founder could ever lead a company to success I mean you've got to have some optimism you got to have some energy it's got to be a little contagious there's going to be a lot of bad days you got to lift people up um so you need that um but what you what I have figured out over the last you know sort of like especially I started with my own family uh and my close relationships my children and my brother and sister and parents and so on is I realized like I'm not really being intimate with them if I'm not sharing when I'm sad or sharing when I'm scared or these kinds of things and so I started working on that uh with them and found it very meaningful I could deepen those relationships very significantly and then I realized those were valid emotions at work too and so it's it turns out like they're more precise all of your emotions are sort of a early warning system you know if you're stressed for me that's a a kind of an early you know a radar that is detecting that I'm that there's something I'm not taking action on there's it's a it's a it's an important indicator and and it turns out if you're if you're channeling all of your negative emotions into occasion into frustration or anger or something like that you're you're not being very precise it it's much better now like I've had you know I'll have a meeting and I listens for a while and when it's my turn to talk I'll say I'm scared and that's more effective people are like you're what are you scared of and then you can start talking about okay what is what's making you scared that's um you get more in touch it actually help you probably not with your family relationships your close Intimate Relationships but I think it helps you at work too let me ask an Amazon question uh Amazon is your baby and for sure um you stepped away from that yeah um what did that feel like how hard was that for you and what is it like now well um I even when Amazon was a tiny company for whatever reason I always had in my mind that I wanted to build a company that would Outlast me and so I've always been thinking about it in that framework and uh how it could could could kind of grow up into a young adult and be set off into the world uh successfully and independently um and that's very different you know um you there you can do things you can build companies in different ways you don't have to do that you know you can there's you can have be the genius with a thousand helpers you can and that's also can be very successful there's nothing wrong with it it's just it wasn't what I wanted to do and and I you know it was I felt like a parent sending you know or maybe like with your kids become go off to college or maybe when they graduate from college and you're hoping that you've created this independent child you know now adult young adults who can go off in the world you don't you don't want them to be dependent on you if they are you've failed and I've also I've always preached inside the company and to myself that no one is indispensable I think it's most important for CEOs to look at themselves in the mirror every day and see I'm not indispensable and if you if you so I I want Amazon to go off without me and I'm still at Amazon by the way I haven't left fully and I am a parent and I will but I'm a 60-year-old man and my mom and dad still worry about me right so you never stop being a parent my heart is in Amazon my curiosity is Amazon my fears are there my love is there I'm never going to forget about Amazon I'll always be there to help um and right now I'm putting a lot of time in it because it's Al I you know I can help and it's super interesting so why not but this is the right way in my view to think about this you know big leaders only have to do a few things big leaders have to identify the Big Ideas they have to enforce tough execution right against those big ideas and they need to grow the next generation of leaders okay so two that's really it so two things um and so my job part of my what one of my jobs right now is to make sure Andy you know Andy jasse and the whole leadership team are successful I take that job very seriously that's what I was going to ask as a parent yeah your parent kids can go off but sometimes they do things you don't want the kids to do absolutely I just my I've got kids in college age and just out of college and I still have to vend more the money every once in a while just happened just um we we'll talk about what you subscribe and save to in just a moment on your app but um help us help us with this you just said you're very you're very involved with it right now what is it that you're doing at Amazon ai ai yeah so I mean there are a few things but small but it's 95% Ai and where do you it's just so because there we are literally working on a thousand applications internally so AI you have to remember AI modern AI is a horizontal enabling layer it it it it will it it can be used to improve everything it will be in everything um this is most like El electricity art I went to a um Brewery in Luxembourg many years ago now in fact this trip was one of the little tiny catalysts for the founding of AWS the and the brewery was 300 years old this company making beer for 300 years a lot of the oldest companies of the world are breweries by the way I don't know why this is and they were very proud of their history and they had a museum and in that museum was an electric power generator 100 years old and because when they wanted to improve the efficiency of their Brewery with electricity there was no power grid so they had to build their own power station so they made their own electricity and at that time that's what everybody did if a hotel wanted electricity they had their own electric generator and I looked at this and I thought this is what computation is like today everybody has their own Data Center and that's not going to last it makes no sense you're going to buy a compute Off the Grid that's AWS we had we were doing it internally in Amazon for ourselves and the apis were created there's that that's a very interesting story in its own right but the this is you know these kind of horizontal layers like electricity and compute and now artificial intelligence they they go everywhere there isn't I guarantee you there is not a single application that you can think of that is not going to be made better by Ai and where do you think Amazon is in this we've been talking about large language models yeah uh all day we talked to Sam we talked to Sundar um clearly AWS has a a big opportunity but on the language model piece it doesn't have its own does it matter you've been so busy yeah Andrew that you did not see I did see yester our announcements yesterday I did see the announ about Nova yes well that is a large language model and it is our own and do you believe that that model is competitive with yes these other models it it is absolutely competitive so it is um uh benchmarks extraordinarily well it's a worldclass foundation model it's a Frontier Model um and and it's very very price performant do you think that all these things we were talking about it earlier become commoditized though the models themselves I don't think they'll be exactly commoditized but I think there will be I think models will end up being specialists at certain they'll be better at slightly some will have lower latency uh you know some will be you know better at calling apis there's there's a there will turn out to be a bunch of flavors just like you you might not consult you know if you're phoning a friend and Consulting somebody you're not always going to consult the same person for everything it won't be exactly like that because this kind of intelligence that we're creating is a little alien it's very different uh from Human intelligence in certain ways these these these Transformers these large generative AI um and uh you know so there I think even you know even even a single application is likely to call multiple AI models depending on what you know some of them will be lower cost because they have a small number of parameters and then every once in a while you'll have to call the really big model the big models are mostly going to be used I don't know yeah probably mostly but they'll certainly be often used as teacher models so you know this is what we announced yesterday was Nova there are four classes of model there's the the giant you know Frontier Model but that model you know we just still down to the smaller models that are more cost effective have lower latency and can and provide different levels of intelligence so that's a really you know this whole thing is is fascinating it's by the way also one of the way it's very interesting to think about how alien this kind of it's it's um you know in some ways these models are already harder than humans because they're more multidisiplinary right um it's very difficult for a human to you know be an expert in you know even if you're a doctor you really have to specialize you know you can be does it excite you or scare you oh it excites me I'm not are you no I'm no I'm not scared I just want I do we do talk about sort of uh human you know what it's going to mean to be a human when this is all well I you know so I've had this conversation about with various people about what it means to be human and and people say well you know if AI is smarter than us better than us at various things won't that take the meaning out of your life or some you know some question along those lines and I said look I consider myself to be a very good writer but I know people who are much better writers than I am and in fact I don't think there's any single thing that I'm the best in the world at if I go down if I'm being really honest with myself there I can always find something I I know people who are better than me at math I know you know people who are better than me at dancing that's for sure so you know there like literally I go right down the line and I can always find somebody better and and yet that doesn't take meaning if you're if meaning only if you only get meaning because you're the best in the world of something then very few of us are going to have meaning in our lives there isn't going to be a lot of meaning and really your meaning is coming from your relationships you know how uplifting people so like if you if you think about by the way that uplifting can be very local think it's like if you're just uplifting your brother and sister you're uplifting your kids you're uplifting you know your friends and and the people in your community you're going to get meaning from that do you think technology has made that better or worse we were talking to Prince Harry earlier he clearly thinks it's social media and I don't are you on social media I am on social media sometimes and you say sometimes well I I am not addicted to social media I go in and look and and um I try to mine it for ideas sometimes and and it it it is uh it's a lot of work to find the little nuggets of there where there are some like I I follow a bunch of people who I think are really smart and uh and if I some if I can stay just on those but invariably the algorithm captures my attention and takes me down a different path you're I've seen you you're very good at compartmentalizing meaning I you will put the phone down I never I never pick up my I'm is that a natural act though it's easy for me I'm very I'm a um I'm a Serial multitasker so I'm very very focused when I was in monor school they told my mom that um I was problematic because I wouldn't switch tasks and my teacher would have to pick my whole chair up and move me in my chair to the next task and so I you know it's it's easy for me if I'm at dinner with friends I'm at dinner I do not want I don't it's not hard for me that is not hard for me I'm a good focuser that's hard for me um two other things before we go uh there are these different buckets obviously we've talked about blue origin which you spent a lot of your time on now and Amazon and then I see you making investments in robotics and Ai and other things and obviously um uh the Earth fund how do you how what is the day like for you what do how do you sort of see it I I I work from about 9 to 7 in meetings I mean it's meetings from 9 to 7 it's um and then I have a bunch of documents I read outside that um I get energy from that it is um I've always done that um you can't you know you can't start a company unless you're will to work really hard and not all the work is fun that's why they call it work um a lot of it is fun but I always people if you get half your job to be fun you're crushing it um you know that you got to have your expectations set right if you if you come out of college and think like 100% of your job is going to be fun you're setting yourself a disappointment um here's my final question for you you don't do this that often you mean do these interviews interview very frequently very rare and I'm curious because I do you must read about yourself occasionally um a little bit through social media oh I definitely see things sometimes like with the non-endorsement decision that wasn't very nice of some people so that was so I'm actually just I'm curious what you think the world misunderstands about you we all read about you all the time uh we see you in pictures and all sorts of things everywhere um and I'm curious what you think when when you sort of see the projected version of Jeff basos and the real Jeff basos it's actually the reason I wanted you to be here today U because I've had the opportunity to get to know you over the years um I'm curious though from your Vantage Point what you see as the thing that that the public doesn't well what an interesting I wasn't expecting any questions like this let me think about this it's [Music] um I you know I I gave up on being well understood a long time ago I kind of thought I I realized it was a um It's kind it would take so much energy and you'd probably still fail you know be understood to be understood is too difficult it's as a public figure it's hard enough by the way to be well understood by your loved ones you know by your kids and your and your and your close family members and your closest friends even that is difficult like you know it takes a lot of energy and I think to be well understood by the world I my I would POS it to you that if you think you understand any public figure you probably don't is there may be some exceptions where the people I don't know maybe like Oprah when she had her show because she really was you you're talking you saw her so often and and in so many different circumstances that maybe you got a real sense of her and you know I know her and she does seem like the woman on her show like it so there I think there are these rare cases where people end up defining themselves but mostly you end up defined by a small set of things that catch ATT as a public figure that catch people's attention and um and they they tend to they just dominate the entire conversation you know like I you know in my case it would be wealth or something like this people would would say you know it's very hard if you're you know um I had a a very funny moment on stage with Bill Gates once uh it was shortly after I had become the wealthiest person in the world and I had taken that title from Bill a title which I had you know I tell you I promise you I had never sought and um and uh we were being interviewed the Two of Us by I remember who the moderator was but he said uh uh Bill how do you feel about this guy stealing your number one uh wealthiest person title and before bill could answer I looked at Bill and said you're welcome um because of course it's not it's actually just a uh that particular thing is tends to be dominant in our culture it kind of people over focus on it and then they think you're focused on it which isn't really true um it's you know in my case I think of myself as an inventor that's what I am and I wake up every day and I follow my curiosity and I explore and I really am an inventor I'm very good at that I'm a very good lateral thinker and I love problems and I love a whiteboard and I love having a team of other smart people and we work together and we find unusual solutions to things and that's how I think of myself so like if I could somehow have a forbs list of inventors and if I could climb my way to the top of that inventor list that's what would make me and then I'd be understood or at least in part but I don't somehow I think it you have to decide too as a public figure how much energy do you want to put into being understood because you can spend a lot of time and it probably still wouldn't work so you know it probably helps to do an occasional interview like this I did Lex I did Le Freedman and um I've done a couple of things and so you don't want to be so mist serious nobody ever sees you and they you know you want to be the uh the the Howard Hughes or whatever you don't want to be a reclose completely but I also I really value my time I work very hard I care deeply about the things I work on and every minute I'm doing something like this is a minute I am not doing something else not that I'm not happy to do this I am and and I have enjoyed it and you're very good at it um thank you Jeffrey Bezos Jeff Bezos thank you so much uh thank you for your time today we very very much appreciate that was a spectacular conversation thank you so so much um"
