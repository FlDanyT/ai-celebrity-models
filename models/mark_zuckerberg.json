      "transcript": "I'd love to start with these. 10 years of work right there. Someone on your team called these the real life Tony Stark glasses. Very hard to make each one of these... That makes me feel incredibly optimistic... In a world where AI gets smarter and smarter... This is probably going to be the next major platform after phones... I miss hugging my mom. Yeah haptics is hard... How does generative AI change how social media feels?... We haven't found the end yet... The average American has fewer friends now than they did 15 years ago. Why do you think that's happening? I mean there's a lot going on to to unpack there... I'm about to interview Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. There are not that many people with more power over what our future might look like. Nearly half the total human population now uses Meta products and I just tested some of their new tech that feels like science fiction. This is crazy! Mark Zuckerberg and the team at Meta are imagining a future that billions of other people might actually end up living in. So my goal for this conversation is to try to figure out what that future really looks like. To paint a picture of the future Mark Zuckerberg is trying to build so that you can decide for yourself what you think of it. Welcome to the first episode of our new series, Huge Conversations Hey, good to meet you! Thanks for doing this. Yeah looking forward to it. Awesome. I'd love to tell you what my goal is of this conversation. Go for it. We have a called huge if true which is this very optimistic about science and technology and the potential futures that we can build and in every episode we're sort of exploring what does it look like if you play a certain technological future out and so my goal in this conversation is to try to help people see the future that you're imagining when you're building the products that you and the Meta team are building. What are you imagining this looks like in future? How are you imagining people use this? All of that. Cool. All right awesome. So I'd love to start with these. Let's do it. 10 years of work right there! I got to demo them a little bit earlier today. I heard someone on your team call these the real life Tony Stark glasses? We're getting there. But I'd love to just hear in your voice what are these? Well these are the first full holographic augmented reality glasses I think that exist in the world. We've made I think it's a a few thousand or something right. Very hard to make each one of these but this is the culmination of 10 years of research and and development that we've done to basically miniaturize all the computing that you need to have glasses not a headset but glasses that can put full holograms into the world with a wide field of view. So you can imagine sort of in the future we'd be having a version of this conversation where you know maybe I or you are not even here it's like one of us is physically here and the other one is here as a as kind of a full body hologram and it's not just a video call you can actually interact you can do things I mean in the the demo we had the you know ping pong and games and things like that but I mean you could you can interact you can work together you can you know play poker play chests whatever like the holographic cards holographic board game. I just think it's going to be wild. it's going to remake I think so many different fields that we think about today from how we work and productivity to a lot of things around science a lot of things around education entertainment fun gaming. But this is just the beginning you know this is the first version, it's a prototype version that we've made in order to develop the next version which is hopefully going to be the consumer one that we sell to a lot of people. Why build these? Well I think it's going to be the next major computing platform. So if you look at like the grand arc of computing over time you've you've gone from like main frames to computers that basically like live on you know your desk or on a tower to phones that you have in your hand that you basically like you know can take with you everywhere that you want but it's it's pretty unnatural right it takes you away from the world around you and. I think that the trend in computing is it gets more ubiquitous it gets more natural and it just gets more social right so you want to be able to interact with people in the world around you and I think that this is probably going to be the next major platform after phones. I'll give these to you. These are the clear ones that show all the... The whole thing is a special edition and this is like a really special edition. There's not a single millimeter of of space. You know everything in here from the micro projectors that um basically shoot light into the wave guides right it's a special type of display system. I mean these aren't normal displays like you have in a phone or a TV or computer like the type of displays that people have been building for decades. It's a waveguide system. The projector that's shooting light basically goes into these nano etchings across the wave guide that are what catches and creates the holograms. In order to synchronize that with your where you're looking there's eye tracking and little cameras, they illuminate your eyes and then of course there's all the basic stuff that you need all the computing, the batteries to power the whole thing, microphones, the speakers because it needs to be able to play audio and speak with you and the cameras and sensors to see things around you in the world so that way when it's placing holograms in the world it can do that in the right place and understand where you are so that probably is still not covering everything because there's a lot of things that need to go into syncing up the holographic images between the two displays because you don't just have a single display like you have in a phone or TV you have two and it moves around and you know physical things are hard and need to be synced up. There's also the radio that has to communicate with your other computing devices to do heavier computing um and the wrist based neural interface that you probably got to try out. We kind of miniaturized all of this and fit it into uh you know normal looking pair of glasses which is... you know when I told the team that we were going to do this 10 years ago you know people weren't sure if we were going to be able to but I think you not only we're going to be able to do this but I think we're going to be able to get it cheaper and higher quality and even even smaller and more stylish over time. So I think this is going to be a pretty wild future. There are so many versions of trying to get a similar idea of digital objects in physical space. I'm thinking of for example of glasses that have heads up displays where it's headlocked and it's moving with my eyes, glasses that are really creating digital objects in physical space that don't move as I move, I'm thinking of these, I'm also thinking of the Snapchat Spectacles that they just announced, then on the other hand there are headsets like the Quest and also like the Apple Vision Pro that seem to fall into a different category. I'm curious how you would organize this landscape for people and how you think about people using these tools in their real lives in the near future? Yeah so when we were getting started on this about 10 years ago I thought that something like this was going to be the ultimate product for everyone. Right you get to you know normal looking pair of glasses and we'll continue improving that that can have full holographic images. I think it's super powerful and it is sort of the science fiction future that I think we all hope to get to. On the journey we took a few other approaches as well um to help us develop towards that including building glasses that don't have displays to try to learn. Just take a stylish pair of glasses today and put as much technology into it as you can but really focus on the form factor and that's the Ray Ban Meta glasses and it's doing really well and initially we thought that that was sort of intro product for us to learn how to build this but one of the things that's clear now is you're going to be able to make that product a lot more affordable than this probably permanently. So I actually think that there are going to be a bunch of different of these paths that we've taken are going to be kind of permanent product lines that people will choose. I think you'll see display-less glasses like the Ray Ban Metas continue to get better and better, great for AI, no display but you can talk to it, it can talk back. I think there's going to be something in between these that's basically a heads up display, so it's not a 70° field of view, maybe it's a 20° or 30 degree field of view, so that's not going to be what you want for putting kind of a full hologram of a person or interacting with the world around you but it's going to be great for you know when you're talking to AI, not just having voice but also being able to see what it's saying or being able to text someone with your wrist-based neural interface and then have their text show up rather than having it read to you, which is, we read faster than we can listen or getting directions right or just being able to search for information get all that. So there's a lot of value for heads up display that will be somewhat more expensive than the display-less but somewhat cheaper than this. Then I think you're going to get this. It's going to be probably the most premium and and expensive of glasses products but hopefully still something that you know like a computer is generally accessible to most people in the world but I think that there are going to be all of those and I I think people will like them. I also think that the headsets that people are using around mixed reality will continue to be a thing too because no matter how good we get at miniaturizing the tech for this you're just going to be able to fit more compute into a full headset. Fundamentally our mission is not you know build something that is advanced and only a few people can use, we want to take it you the last mile and do all the innovation to get it to everyone. We you know just shipped or announced Quest 3S, the new mixed reality headset where we basically are delivering high quality mixed reality for $299. I was really proud last year when we delivered Quest 3, the first kind of really high quality high resolution color mixed reality device for $500, right it was like, it's like a fraction of the cost of of what the competitors are doing and I think it's actually higher quality in a lot of ways, and now we've just doubled down on that. So I think that they're all actually going to end up being important long-term product lines: display-less, heads up display, full holographic AR, full headsets. I think that they're all going to be important. Yeah. If you play out the future of not just the hardware that we've been talking about so Meta Ray Bans, Quest, Orion, but also the Llama models, if everything goes according to you and the teams wildest dreams, I'd love for you to just begin to describe what that feels like. I mean I think that there are two primary values that we're trying to bring. On the AR and kind of mixed reality side, the main value we're trying to bring is this feeling of presence .Right so there's something that I think is just really deep about being physically present with another person that you don't get from any other technology today and I think that's the thing when people have a very visceral reaction to experiencing virtual or mixed reality what they're really reacting to is that they actually for the first time with technology feel a sense of presence like they're in a place with the person and that's super powerful. I focused on designing social apps and experiences for 20 years that's sort of like the Holy Grail of that is being able to build a technology platform that delivers this like deep sense of of social presence. The other big track is around personalized AI and for that and that's sort of where Llama and Meta AI and all those things are going. There's all this development that's going into making the models smarter and smarter over time but I think where this is going to get really compelling is when it's personalized for you and in order for it to be personalized for you it has to have context and understand what's going on in your life both kind of at a global level and like what's physically happening around you right now and in order to do that I think that glasses are going to be the ideal form factor because they're positioned on your face in a way where they can let them see what you see and hear what you hear which are the two most important senses that we use for for kind of taking information and context about the world. I think that this is all going to be kind of really deep and profound stuff but it's basically those two things: It's this feeling of presence and this capability of really personalized intelligence that can help you. I'd love to talk about each of those two things. The first on presence, I owe a lot to being able to connect with people online. Right this job that I have is by definition that, also with my family. My parents don't live anywhere close to me. I video call them a lot and when I think about the progress of technology like this in a timeline from the telegram to the telephone to video call to some feeling of presence with another person who's feels like they're right there in front of me, that makes me feel incredibly optimistic. I would love a future where like I can lose in Scrabble to my mom and feel like she's really there in front of me. Yeah and it feels like we're not that far away from something - I agree! - that persuades my brain that that's happening. Yeah totally. And also I miss hugging my mom right like that never goes away. Yeah haptics is hard. Yeah and so my question is about that it's about this this feeling of like it's hard for me to imagine um a future where real physical presence is not different and special in some way where I don't miss literally hugging my mom and I'm curious how you think about the parts of human connection that are eye contact and physical touch and things that our ape brains value for connection with other people. Yeah well eye contact I think we're going to get to a lot before the the touch part. For haptics I do think we'll make progress on that but it's it's obviously there's a spectrum there too from kind of hands which is where if you you draw out the kind of like homunculus version of a person in terms of like what are what are our kind of sensory you know what what's like the majority of what we're sensing it's like yeah yeah so I think being able to do that for your hands is probably the most important place to start and you have a rough version of that with controllers today. I think that that'll get even more over time. We have this demo playing pingpong where you have a controller where as the digital ball hits the ping pong paddle you feel it hit the as if it's hitting the ping pong paddle wherever it is so you actually have a sense of like where it's it's hitting the the the paddle so I think that was that was just a wild demo so I think we'll get some of that the most extreme version of this is wanting force feedback right so I mean like for doing a lot of sports right it's it's like okay we can kind of do a good approximation of like boxing today or you get like good feedback on your hands but it would be hard to do a virtual reality version of Jiu-Jitsu where you're like grappling with someone and you need like real kind of force feedback on that so that's probably like the hardest thing right to go do but I think we'll get there. You know I think like most science fiction it's not this binary thing that you just like wake up one day and we're like oh we've realized all the dreams but but I I do think that these platforms are going to be the first time that I think that there's a realistic sense of presence in all the ways that that's special to people for most things that people want to do which are not the most physical ones and even some of the basic physical ones I think we'll get. But then there's a long tale of other stuff I mean smell is also really important for people yeah right it's I think it's disproportionately important for memories and that's not really a thing that I think in the next few years we're going to have in any of these devices I mean that's a very difficult and challenging thing on its own. What is the piece of that that you feel most interested in, that you keep coming back to in your mind? This has the frustrating property to develop that the sense of presence is almost like when you're designing something that that's sort of trying to artificially deliver it you're delivering an illusion to a person and more than any one thing that provides a sense of presence it's actually more the case that any one thing done wrong breaks the sense of presence. You kind of know that you're interacting with technology but it's so convincing that um that you just kind of go along with it. You're like okay yeah no this person feels like it feel like they're there right. When I did that pingpong demo I like at the end of it I dropped the pingpong paddle on the virtual table and it shattered so that was not the best for for our internal development but like that's winning in our in our development right it's like when when you feel like something is is kind of so realistic that you you're just convinced that um that it's there now and there are a lot of things that can break that right so I think a a field of view that's too low right so something feels real but then you turn your head and it's not there um latency read physics that don't behave like realistic physics. It also is interesting in some ways what people can accept as physically real even though it's not right so like we've done a ton of work on avatars we we have this whole work stream on Kodak avatars to do these photo avatars and it's I think it's going to be incredbly compelling and people are going to love it but one of the things I found interesting is the ability to mix photorealistic and expressive kind of the cartoony avatars with photorealistic worlds and kind of more cartoony computer game type worlds so you can have the a Kodak kind of photorealistic avatar of a person in what is clearly like a video game or cartoon world and people are generally pretty fine with that it's like okay that that feels pretty good and similarly having a photorealistic world but good increasingly good kind of cartoon avatars as long as the avatars move in a way that feels authentic to the person you're interacting with it actually feels pretty good you know it's when you look at a 2d still frame of it some of the stuff can look a little bit silly and and we've certainly you know had had a our share of memes around that but um but when you're in there you know and you you've played around with lot of the stuff it feels realistic because it's basically mimicking the kind of authentic mannerisms of of a person that you're interacting with and even if it's not a Kodak photo realistic avatar if it's kind of a more cartoony expressive one so I I think that that's it's very interesting to see kind of which pieces you need to unlock and what where you just need to be like very technically excellent and consistent but it's um this isn't a space where it's like you deliver one thing and it's good this is like there's a wide breth of things that you need to nail and then have it all come together and that's why these are you know 10 year projects. It seems like an interesting way to learn about the human brain and what we actually care about with respect to what feels real. I was wondering about, there was this moment in an interview that you did with Lex Friedman, you quoted research that says that the average American has fewer friends now than they did 15 years ago and I was so interested in that because it seems like if we want to get to a world where there's more human connection this is the trend that we're going to have to grapple with and just to give some data on this in the American Time Use Survey over the last 20 years the amount of time American adults spend socializing in person has dropped by nearly 30%. For ages 15 to 24 according to the Surgeon General it's nearly 70%. and I look at that data and I think to myself well maybe if we're all socializing digitally that doesn't matter so much maybe there's a future where that's actually fine but there's also data that suggest that we're struggling somewhat. The number of Americans who say that they don't have a single close friend - yeah it's really sad - that share has jumped from 3% to 12% in the last 30 years. It feels to me like with all the tools that we've built for human connection, we're struggling to connect and I'm curious why do you think that's happening? I mean there's a lot going on to to unpack there. A lot has changed sort of economically and socially during that period and a lot of those trends go back before a lot of the modern technology. So I mean this is something that a lot of academics and folks have have studied but it is an interesting lens to look at this though because I think whenever you're talking about building digital types of connection one of the first questions that you get is is that going to replace the physical connection and my answer to that especially in the case of something like this is that no because people already don't have as much connection as they would like to have. It's not like this is replacing some sort of better physical connection that they would have otherwise had. It's that the average person would like to have 10 friends and they have two right or three and there's just more demand to socialize than what people are able to do given the current construct and giving people the ability to be present with people who are in other places physically just seems like it will unlock more. It's not going to make it so, if I have glasses, it's not going to make it that I spend less time with my wife, it's going to make it so that I spend more time with you know my sister who lives across the country. And that's, I think that's good. I think people need that. As for the rest, I I think we could probably spend a multi-hour podcast just going into all of the different kind of socioeconomic political dynamics that are going on but none of the trends that I've seen does it seem like the primary thing that's going on is that because people are interacting online they're now not interacting with their with people physically. Now certainly I think you you I do interact with people online who I also like to interact with physically but and I think that that's kind of like a combination um like more combined richer relationship that you have overall but I think that there's a lot going on with the loss of of kind of social capital and connections that really predates a lot of the modern technology. The goal of what, I'm what I'm trying most to learn about is how we can structure the technologies that we use in the future to get toward this future I think you're imagining of more human connection in more ways. I'm curious, you brought up the other big pillar of AI and in some of your conversations, I'm thinking of a conversation with Tim Ferris in particular, you talked about a lot of different use cases of AI and they seem to me to fall on somewhat of a spectrum. Like for example you mentioned automatic real-time translation, like basically the Star Trek Universal translator. We're pretty much there! Yeah and that's one example on one end of the spectrum where some people might argue that there is a chance that someone is less likely for example to learn a language because we can all speak to each other in real time in different languages. I think nobody would really argue that therefore we shouldn't have that kind of universal translator. People still learn Latin and Greek. Right exactly and so I think that end of the spectrum is something like um technologies that really measurably unlock our humanity because they remove a struggle between people and then on the other end of the spectrum there are a lot of educational things for example where the struggle is kind of the point right? Like it's like building a muscle. I can think of so many times in my life where like the reason why I was doing something was not the output it was the fact that I was trying so hard to do it. There's one example in the Tim Ferris interview where you talked about your kids struggling to articulate themselves emotionally and adults very much had the same problem and you talked about AI as a way to help them articulate those emotions. Yeah and I thought about all of the many times in my life where I have struggled to articulate my emotions and how I really could have used some help in those moments and I also found myself thinking about the times when that was really building a muscle where like the act of struggling to communicate with someone and understand what they wanted from me was was important to my development. And so my question is if you think about that as a spectrum between things that are really important to our humanity where and the struggle being removed is helpful versus things where the struggle is the point and it unlocks something about our humanity and is important to preserve like building a muscle, how do you draw the line between those things and how do we ensure that the muscles that we're building for this future are stronger and not weaker? Yeah it's interesting I mean I think we're always going to find new things to struggle with and I mean it's you can always get better at communicating with other people and kind of expressing yourself and understanding other people so having a tool that can help you do that better isn't going to mean that like oh now we perfectly understand every you know it's I mean I think the maybe one of the most functional aspects of this you're already seeing a lot of these AI models really help people with coding right like a generation ago um before I was getting started a lot of coding was like really low-level system software and you know then by the time that I got into it there was a little bit of that but um you you can make websites pretty easily make apps pretty easily and I think in 20 years or a lot sooner than that you're going to basically be in a world where kids will be able to just describe the things that they want and build incredibly complex pieces of software so it's um in that world are kids going to be not struggling I I don't think so I think that they're going to be just expressing their creativity and and it'll it'll be this kind of constant iterative feedback loop around like okay like yeah I you know took a few minutes to describe this thing and like yeah this whole like amazing virtual world was created that I can have see on my glasses or whatever but like these things are not exactly what I want them to be so now I need to like go back and edit them it just I don't know I think that there's always more. Another way to get this - it's one of the things that I think makes makes people so good. It just there's there's always more to do. We'll always find the struggle? Yeah. Another way to get at this is if you if you play this out to make the tools even better in like 10 years let's say your kids are in high school are there ways that you would want them using AI because you think it would accelerate them intellectually and ways that you would advocate for them not to use it or things that you would have concerns about? I mean I think that there's some things that you need to be able to do yourself. I think that's a lot of the basic fear that people have around this is that while we're building these amazing tools we get away from this self-confidence and ability of being able to do like this basic stuff yourself so it's like all right you have a calculator but it's still good to be able to do kind of basic math in your head because there are a lot of things that come up throughout the day that you just want to have a general numeracy around right that often they're not expressed in numerical terms but just in terms of understanding trends or understanding arguments that people are making, you you kind of need to understand the shape of how numbers come together and so I think one of the big debates is like should we still teach our kids to program computers even though you're going to have these tools in the future that are just so much more powerful than anything that we have now to produce incredibly complicated pieces of software. I think the answer to that is probably yes because I think teaching someone how to code is teaching them a way to think rigorously and that even if they're not doing most of the code production I think it's important that you kind of have the ability to think in that way and I think it's going to just make you generally a better thinker and better person so yeah maybe that's like this generation's version of calculators it's like so you you want to you want to use the calculator but you'll also want to be able to generally do without it. Other ones like language I don't know I mean different people can come out I think this is one of the interesting questions about parenting these days is like is is just kind of like what what's important to teach your your kids and in an era where so much is going to change over the the time that they're even in school. Language I think you can make similar arguments. I think there's a lot of it's like it's probably going to be less functionally relevant in the future to learn multiple languages but it sort of helps you think in different ways, you know I found from the languages that I've studied that a lot of it you learn about the structure of your own language, you can you know you also learn about the culture right because so much of how things are expressed in different places is tied to the nuance and the history of kind of what how so I think like you that's all valuable and interesting stuff to get into but then I don't know at the same time we only have so many hours in the day so people need to prioritize what they're going to learn and it may be that okay in a world with perfect translation which by the way we basically just announced on the Ray Ban Metas that now you're going to be able to just like you go to countries yeah we're starting out with just a few languages but we'll roll it out to more and you know you'll be you could be traveling anywhere and you have your glasses and they just translate in real time in your ear. So it's wild, yeah so I think people are going to need to choose what what what they want to focus on going forward. How do the developments that we've been talking about in AI intersect with social media and the platforms that most people use today? There's a future where there's images and generated text and maybe AI influencers. How does generative AI change how social media feels in the future? Yeah I mean I think that that's a really deep one. You know there's already been one big shift which is that social media started out as people primarily interacting with their friends and now it is you know at least half of the content is basically people interacting with creators or content that's not created by people who they kind of personally know so we sort sort of already have that paradigm and I think AI is probably going to accelerate that. It will give all these people additional tools right so your friends will create kind of funnier memes and more interesting content um that'll come from a lot of different ways. I think some of it will be okay your friends have glasses and they capture a bunch of stuff and before they might have not been able bble to edit it to make it interesting or maybe it was just too much work or they didn't even realize that they captured something amazing but now the AI is like hey I like made this thing for you out of your content um it's like okay that's awesome like people will enjoy that. Creators obviously kind of much more specialized skills are going to be able to use even more advanced AI tools to make more compelling content but then I think that there will be a bunch of kind of green field type stuff where maybe in the future there will be content that is purely generated by AI by the system personalized for you maybe it's summarizing things that are out there that that are going to be interesting maybe it's um just producing something funny that makes you laugh this is going to be like a very kind of deep zone that there's a lot to to experiment with. I think there are going to be AI creators as well, as creators building AI versions of themselves, I mean that's a thing that we just showed too at Connect is basically I mean if you're a Creator one of the big challenges is like all right there are only so many hours in the day and your community probably has a nearly unlimited demand to interact with you and you want to interact with them because you're trying to grow your community. I mean that's both socially and from a business perspective that's sort of you know growing the community is an important part of what every creator does so okay if we can make it so that each creator can basically make an like an AI artifact that their community can interact with people be clear it's not the actual creator themselves but it's almost like a piece of digital art that you're producing like an interactive sculpture or something that it's like it's like you train it to here's the context that I wanted to have here's the topics I wanted to communicate on here's stuff that I wanted to stay away from you're giving your community something to interact with when you can't be there to to kind of answer all the questions and I think that's going to be super compelling so there's like these interesting things but I think it's I AI it's kind of like the internet in a way where it's probably going to change almost every field and almost every feature of every application that we use um it seems sort of hyperbolic to say that but I do think that's true and it's just hard to sort of enumerate all the different things up front but I think that over the next 5 to 10 years we're just going to explore the impacts in each of these areas and it's going to be like an amazing amount of innovation and really exciting. I feel two things simultaneously when you say that. I feel both like I really want to be optimistic about the future of these platforms and I obviously have gained so much from an enormous pace of change right like everything that we're doing now and what I actually feel is worried. I feel some specific concerns around the way that you know I might communicate with an audience and the way that they might respond to that or the way that human communication might change but also more generalized just sort of fear of the pace of change and and worry and I don't think I'm alone in that feeling. Yeah and you're supposed to be the optimist! I know! And I'm curious like how you talk to people who feel that way. What concerns do you feel are most legitimate and what do you feel most misunderstood? I think the pace of change is always a concerning thing right it's there is a lot of uncertainty about how how things will go in the future and we're all going to get really amazing new tools to do both our hobbies and our jobs and they'll make it so we can do better work and have better lives but at least on the professional side it's going to be our responsibility to keep up with that or else it's going to be difficult for us to compete with other people who are doing a good job of kind of keeping up with the new trends. So I get it. I mean I think you know especially in the you know line of of work of being a creator and it's a very sort of competitive space, I don't think that like creators necessarily think about it as competitive but it is right it's like it's you know and um and so I get it. I think that this is going to make it so that like the quality of work that people produce and how interesting it is and how much they can communicate and like really efficiently is is just going to kind of go through the roof but but when you're staring down a set of changes like you know that there's some big change coming and you don't know what it is that's always a time of anxiety so I get it. If I take my creator hat off and I'm just a person who is youngish starting out my career-ish, starting out building a family, how would you advise someone like me to prepare well for the future that we're headed toward to be able to learn new skills now or just think about this future in an educated way? Yeah I mean I just think maintaining curiosity about things is is important. I do think we can overstate to what extent the next 10 years is going to be sort of different from the last 10 or 15. I mean a ton of stuff changed over the last 10 or 15 years too. It's not like this is the only time in history where there's some technology it's going to make it so there's new opportunities and things change the internet coming into maturity and everyone having smartphones has already rewired things dramatically and I mean maybe the next period will be a somewhat bigger change or maybe it won't I think it'll feel different to different people but I don't think this is like going from zero to one it's not like okay everything's just kind of been normal and now like now it's about to change it's like the technology of evolves over time and and like the opportunities that we have evolve and improve and I think that's like the people who do well I think are are people who are generally curious about it and and dig in and and try to use it to live better lives rather than the people who who basically you know try to fight it in in some way. One thing that I really want to ask you about is open source. Yeah. I think imagine that we're talking to an audience that has maybe heard that term but doesn't have any real idea of how that might impact them in the development of AI. How would you explain the reasonable debate that people in your field are having about this right now? Well I think there are two pieces. I mean so what does open source mean? It means that people can build a lot of different things right so at a high level I look at the vision that a bunch of companies have right so Open AI, Google, they're building an AI right like one AI that I think in general they're like okay this is going to be it's like you're going to use they think you're going to use Gemini or ChatGPT for like all the different things that you want to interact with and at a high level that's just not how I think the world is going to go. I think we're going to have a lot of different AI systems just like we're going to have we have a lot of different apps. I think in the future every business just like they have a website and a phone number and an email address and a social media account is also going to have an AI that can interact with with their customers to help them sell things to help them do support. I think a lot of creators will have their own AIs right I think like a lot of people will interact with with a bunch of different things. There's a question of okay do you want a future that's fundamentally kind of very concentrated and where you're interacting with kind of one system for everything or do you want one where a lot of different people are building a lot of different AIs and systems just kind of like you probably didn't want there to be you know just one app or just one website. It's like a richer world when there's a diversity of different things so that's one piece is is just giving people the ability to build it themselves and what open source does it makes it that everyone can take and modify the model and build stuff on top of it which is different from the kind of closed and centralized approach. The safety debate is a specific part of this which is in a world where AI gets smarter and smarter, what's the way that we have the highest chance of of having a a a kind of positive future and and not having a lot of the safety concerns? And I think some people think that if we keep the model closed and don't give it to a lot of developers that should make it safer because then you don't get bad developers doing bad things with the model. Historically I think what we've seen with open source is actually the opposite which is that this is not the first open source project right I mean this is obviously this has been a thing in the industry for decades and I think what we've traditionally seen is that open source software is safer and more secure largely because you put it out there more people can scrutinize it because they can see all parts of the system and then there are inevitably issues with any software there are bugs there are security issues and initially with open source people thought hey if you're putting the software out there and there are holes in it isn't everyone just going to go exploit those holes and especially the bad guys but it turned out that it sort of in this counterintuitive way that by making by adding more scrutiny to the systems the holes became apparent quicker and then were fixed and then people roll out a new version just like we roll out a new version of our models right Llama 3, Llama 3.1, Llama 3.2 everyone upgrades, so I think the same thing is going to happen here I think it's sort of this counterintuitive thing where even though I I think there's some concern around all right are bad guys going to do bad things with these models. I actually think you just get a kind of smarter and safer model for everyone the more it's rolled out and the more kind of scrutiny is on it and then part of that is we get feedback and we make the model safer so that is we roll it out to to more people it's safer for more people to use. So I think that the history of open source in the software industry generally would suggest that open source is going to lead to a more prosperous and safer future. Our show is called Huge If True and what I mean by that is kind of testing the most optimistic non-obvious thing and so my question to you is what is the biggest open genuine question on your mind right now? In which field? You're in so many! I am particularly curious about the combination of AI and hardware but I realize that we've covered a lot so I'm curious the direction you'd take this on a question that occupies you right now. Gosh I mean I think maybe one that's a little more AI specific is there a current set of methods that seem to be scaling very well right so with past AI architecture you could kind of feed an AI system a certain amount of data and and use a certain amount of compute but eventually it hit a plateau and one of the interesting things about these new transformer based architectures over the last you know 5 to 10 years is that we haven't found the end yet. So that leads to this dynamic where Llama 3 you know we could train on you know 10 to 20,000 gpus, Llama 4 we could train on you know more more than 100,000 gpus, Llama 5 we can plan to scale even further and there's just an interesting question of how far that goes. It's totally possible that at some point we just like hit a limit and just like previous systems there's an asymptote and it doesn't keep on growing but it's also possible that that limit is not going to happen anytime soon and that we're going to be able to keep on just building more clusters and generating more you know synthetic data train the systems and that they're just going to keep on getting more and more useful for people for quite a while to come and it's a really big and high stakes question I think for for the company is because we're basically making these bets on how much infrastructure to build out for the future and this is like hundreds of billions of dollars of infrastructure so like I'm clearly betting that this is going to keep scaling for a while but it's one of the big questions I think in the field because it is possible that it doesn't. You know that obviously would lead to a very different world where it's I mean I'm sure people still figure it out eventually just need to make some new fundamental improvements to the architecture in some way but that might be a somewhat longer trajectory for okay maybe you know the the kind of fundamental AI advances slow down for a bit and we just take some time to build new products around this or it could be the case and that's what I'm betting on that the fundamental AI will just continue advancing for quite a while and that we're going to get both a new set of products that are just really compelling in all these ways and that the technology landscape and what's possible will just continue being dynamic over like a 20-year period and that's probably what I'd guess is going to happen but it I think it's one of the bigger questions in the industry and kind of for technology across the world today. Is there anything else that you want to say? I don't know! Awesome. We're good. Amazing yeah thank you so much for doing this. Yeah no thank you..."

know chill week yeah sort of um this uh recent announcement that you did about uh content moderation how has that been received um probably depends on who you ask but but you know but look I mean I've been working on this for a long time so I mean you got to do what you think is is right you know we we've been on a long a long journey here right I mean it's um I think at some level you you start you only start one of these companies if you believe in giving people a voice right I mean I mean the whole point of social media is basically you know giving people the ability to share uh what they want right and um and you know it goes back to you know our original Mission is just give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected what do you think started the pathway towards increasing censorship because clearly we were going in that direction for the last few years it seemed like uh we really found out about it when Elon bought Twitter and we got the Twitter files and when you came on here and when you were explaining the relationship with FBI where they were trying to get you to take down certain things that were true and real and certain things they tried to get you to limit the exposure to them so it's these kind of conversations like when did all that start yeah well well look I I think going back to the beginning or like I was saying I think you start one of these if you care about about giving people a voice you know I I wasn't too deep on our content policies for like the first 10 years of the company it was just kind of well known across the company that um we were trying to give people the ability to share as much as possible and issues would come up practical issues right so if someone's getting bullied for example we deal with that right we put in place systems to to fight bullying um you know if someone is saying hey um you know someone's pirating copyrighted content on on the service it's like okay we'll build controls to make it so we'll find IP protected content but it was really in the last 10 years that people started pushing for like ideological based censorship and I think it was two main events that really triggered this in 2016 there was the election of President Trump um also coincided with uh basically brexit in the EU and and sort of the fragmentation of the EU and then you know in 2020 uh there was covid and I I think that those were basically these two events where for the first time um we just place we just face this massive massive institutional pressure to uh to basically start censoring content on ideological grounds I'm sorry to interrupt you but when it first came up in 2016 did it come under the guise of the Russian collusion hoax yeah and this is the thing I at the time I was really sort of ill prepared to to kind of parse what was going on right it's um you know I I think part of my reflection looking back on this is I I kind of think in 2016 in the aftermath I gave too much deference to um a lot of folks in the media who were basically saying okay there's no way that this guy could have gotten elected except for misinformation people can't actually believe this stuff right it has to be that there's this kind of like massive misinformation out there um some of it started with the the Russia collusions stuff um but it kind of morphed into different things over time well it was it was he was so ideologically polarizing right like people didn't want to believe that anybody looked at him and said this should be our president yeah so so I took this and and just kind of assume that everyone was acting in good faith and I said okay well there's like there are concerns about misinformation we should just like when people raised other concerns in the past and we try to deal with them okay yeah people you know if you ask people no one says that they want misinformation so maybe there's something that we should do to to basically try to address this but I was really worried from the beginning about basically becoming this sort of decider of what is true in the world right that's like kind of a crazy position to be in for billions of people using your service and um so we tried to put in place a a you know a system that would deal with it um you know an early tried to basically make it so that um it was really limited we're like all right we're just going to have the system where these these third party fact Checkers and they can check the worst of the worst stuff right so um things that are very clear hoaxes that there's like it's not like like we're not parsing speech about whether something is slightly true or slightly false like Earth is flat um you know things like that right so so that was sort of the original intent we put in place the system and it just sort of veered from there I I think to some degree it's because some of the people whose job is to do factchecking a lot of their industry is focused on political factchecking so they're just kind of veered in that direction we kept on trying to to basically get it to to be what we had originally intended which is just you know it's not the point is to like judge people's opinions it's to to provide in this layer to to to kind of help fact check some of the stuff that seems the most extreme but um it just you know it was it was just never accepted by by people broadly I think people just felt like the fact Checkers were too biased um not necessarily even so much in what they ruled although sometimes I think people would disagree with that a lot of the time it was just what types of things they chose to even go in fact check in the first time in the first place so I I kind of think like after having gone through that whole exercise it um I don't know it's something out of like you know 1984 one of these books where it's just like it really is a slippery slope and it just got to a point where it's just okay this is destroying so much trust especially in the United States to have this program um and I guess it was probably about a few years that I really started coming to the conclusion that we were going to need to to change something about that um Co was the other big one where that was that was also very tricky because you know at the beginning it was you know it's it's like a legitimate Public Health crisis you know in the in the beginning and it's um you know even people who are like the most Ardent First Amendment um you know Defenders that the Supreme Court has this clear pressent that's like all right you you can't yell fire in a crowded theater there are times when if there's an emergency um your your ability to speak can temporarily be curtailed in order to get an emergency under control so I was sympathetic to that at the beginning of Co it seemed like okay you have this virus seems like it's killing a lot of people I don't know like we didn't know at the time how dangerous it was going to be so at the beginning it kind of seemed like okay we should give a little bit of deference to the government and the health Authorities on how we should play this but when it went from you know two weeks to flatten the curve to um you know in like in the beginning it was like okay there aren't enough masks masks aren't that important to then it's like oh no you have to wear a mask and you know all the like everything was shifting around I it just become very difficult to kind of follow and and this really hit the most extrem I'd say during it was during the Biden Administration when they were trying to roll out um the vaccine program and now I'm generally like pretty Pro rolling out vaccines I think on balance the vaccines are more positive than negative but I think that while they're trying to push that program they also tried to censor anyone who was basically arguing against it and they pushed us super hard um to take down things that were honestly were true right I mean they they basically pushed us and and said you know anything that um says that vaccines might have side effects you basically need to take down and I was just like well we're not going to do that like we're clearly not going to do that I mean that that that that is kind of in our who is they who's telling you to take down things that talk about vaccine side effects it was people in the um in the Biden Administration I think it was um you know I wasn't involved in those conversations directly but I think it was how difficult is that to not be involved in those conversations directly Fitness

jogan that's a $76 value gift for free if you go to drink a1.com slj Rogan seriously get on this that's got to be strange too right because you're running the the company but there's clearly you're moderating at scale that's beyond the imagination the number of human beings you're moderating is [ __ ] insane like what is what's a Facebook what how many people use it on a daily basis forget about how many overall like how many people use it regularly it's a 3.2 billion people use one of our services every day that's yeah it's no it's wild more than a third of the planet that's so crazy and it's almost half of Earth well on a monthly basis it is probably happen but just I want I want to say that though for there's a lot of like hypercritical people that are conspiracy theorists and think that everybody is a part of some cabal to control them I want you to understand that whether it's YouTube or all these and whatever place that you think is doing something that's awful it's good that you speak because this is how things get changed and this is how people find out that people are upset about content moderation and and censorship but moderating at scale is insane it's insane what we were talking the other day about the number of videos that go up every hour on YouTube and it's bananas it's bananas that's like to try to get a human being that is reasonable logic logical and objective that's going to analyze every video it's virtually impossible it's not possible so you got to use a bunch of tools you got to get a bunch of things wrong and you have also people reporting things and how how much is that going to affect things there you could have mass reporting because you have Bad actors you have some corporation that decides we're going to attack this video cuz it's bad for us get it taken down MH there's so much going on just I want to put that in people's heads before we go on like understand the kind of numbers that we're talking about here now understand you have the the pandemic and then you have the administration that's doing something where I think they cross the line where it gets really weird where they're saying what you were saying they were trying you to get you to take down vaccines side effects which is just crazy yeah so I mean like you're saying I mean this is it's so complicated this system that I could spend every minute of all of my time doing this and not actually focused on building any of the things that we're trying to do AI glasses like the future of social media all that stuff so um so I I get involved in this stuff but in general we we have a policy team there are people who I trust they're the people are kind of working on this on a day-to-day basis and the interactions that um that I was just referring to I mean a lot of this is documented I mean because uh you know Jim Jordan and the the house had this whole investigation and committee into into the the kind of government censorship around stuff like this and we produced all these documents and it's all in the public domain I mean basically these people from the Biden Administration would call up our team and like scream at them and curse and it's like these documents are it's all kind of out there did you record any of those phon phone calls I don't no I don't think I don't think we but but I think I want listen I mean there are emails the emails are published it's all it's all kind of out there and um and they're like and basically it just got to this point where we were like no we're not going to we're not going to take down things that are true that's ridiculous um they wanted us to take down this meme of Leonardo DiCaprio looking at a TV talking about how 10 years from now or something um you know you're going to see an ad that says okay if you took a covid vaccine you're um eligible you you know like uh for for this kind of payment like this sort of like class action lawsuit type Meme and they're like no you have to take that down we just said no we're not we're not going to take down humor and satire we're not going to take down things that are that are true and then at some point um I guess uh I don't know it flipped a bit I mean Biden when he was he gave some statement at some point I don't know if it was a press conference or to some journalist where he basically was like these guys are killing people and and and um and I don't know then like all these different agencies and branches of government basically just like started investigating and coming after our company it was it was brutal it was brutal wow yeah it's just a massive overstepping also you weren't killing people this is this is the thing about all of this it's like they suppressed so much information about things that people should be doing regardless of whether or not you believe in the vaccine regardless put that aside metabolic health is of the utmost importance in your everyday life whether there's a pandemic or there's not and there's a lot of things that you can do that can help you recover from illness it prevents illnesses it makes your body more robust and healthy it strengthens your immune system and they were suppressing all that information and that's just crazy you can't say you're one of the good guys if you're suppressing information that would help people recover from all kinds of diseases not just covid the flu common cold all sorts of different things high doses of Vitamin C D3 with K2 and magnesium they were suppressing this stuff because they didn't want people to think that you could get away with not taking a vaccine which is really crazy when you're talking about something that 99.07% of people survive this is a crazy overstep but scared the [ __ ] out of a lot of people redpilled as it were a lot of people because they realized like oh 1984 is like an instruction manual it's like this is it shows you how things can go that way with wrong speak and with bizarre Distortion of facts and when it comes down to it in today's day and age the way people get information is through your platform through X this is how people are getting information they're getting information from YouTube they're getting information from from a bunch of different sources now and you can't censor that if it's real legitimate information because it's not ideologically convenient for you yeah so I mean that's basically the journey that I've been on Right started off very Pro free free speech free expression um you know then over the last 10 years there were been these two big episodes it was the Trump election and the aftermath where I feel like in retrospect I deferred too much to the kind of critique of the media on what we should do um and since then I think generally Trust in Media has fallen off a cliff right so I don't think I'm alone in that journey I think you know that's basically the the the experience that that a lot of people have had is okay it's the the stuff that's being written about is not kind of all accurate um and and even if the facts are right it's kind of written from a slant a lot of the time of course and then um and then there's the government version of it which was during Co which is okay like it's like our government is is telling us that we need to censor true things it's like this is a disaster and it's you know it's not just the US right I think um you know a lot of people in the US focus on this as an American phenomenon but I kind of think that the reaction to co probably caused a breakdown in trust in a lot of um governments around the world because I mean you know 2024 was a big election year around the world and um you know there all these countries India you know just like a ton of countries that had that had elections and the incumbents basically lost every single one um so there is some sort of a global phenomenon where the the um whether it was because of inflation because of the the economic policies to deal with um with covid or or just how how the governments dealt with Co um seems to have had this effect that's Global not just the us but like a very broad decrease in trust at least in in that set incumbents and maybe in in sort of these Democratic institutions overall so I I think that what you're saying of yeah how do people get their information now it's by sharing it online on social media um I think that that's just increasingly true and my view at this point is like all right like we started off focused on free expression we kind of had this pressure tested over the last period I I feel like I just have a much greater command now of what I think the policy should be and like this is how it's going to be going forward and um and so I'm I mean at this point I think you I think a lot of people look at this as like a purely political thing you know it's because they they kind of look at the timing and they're like hey well you're doing this right after the election it's like okay I try not to like change our content rules like right in the middle of an election either right it's like there's not like a great time to do this it's you know um and you want to do it a year later yeah it's like there's no good time to do it there you know at whatever time is is going on there's going to be you know so um the good thing about doing it after the election is you get to take this kind of cultural p pul as like okay where are people right now and how are people thinking about it we try to have policies that reflect um you know mainstream discourse uh but yeah I mean I I don't know this is something I've been thinking about for a while I think that this is going to be pretty durable because at this point we've just been pressure tested on this stuff for like the last8 to 10 years with like these huge institutions just pressuring us and um and I I I feel like this is kind of the right place to be going forward what was it like when they were attacking you like first of all what was the premise like what what would they were they saying was your offense was it that you were allowing information that was not true that was getting out there I know there was also they're saying that you guys were allowing hate groups to speak there was a lot of this yeah I mean the the TR the tough thing with politics is that there's like well when you say who someone's coming after you are you referring to kind of the government and investigations and all that I mean so the issue is that there's the there's what specific thing an agency might be looking into you for and then there's like the underlying political motivation which is like why do the people who are running this thing hate you and I think that those can often be two very different things so I we had organizations that were looking into us that were like not really involved with social media like I like the cfpb like this um Financial I don't even know what it stands for it's the it's the financial organization um that Elizabeth Warren had set up oh great and and it's basically it's like we're not a bank theing section yeah no so so like we're not a bank right it's like like what what does meta have to do with this but they kind of found some theory that they wanted to investigate and it's like okay clearly they were trying really hard right to to like find find some Theory but it like I don't know it just it kind of like throughout the the the the the party and the government there was just sort of I don't know if it's I don't know how this stuff works I mean I've never been in government I don't know if it's like a directive or it's just like a quiet consensus that like we don't like these guys they're not doing what we want we're going to punish them but um but it's uh it's uh it's tough to be at the other end of that what was it like um well it's not good I think well the thing that I think is actually the toughest though is um it's it's Global right so and and really when you think about it the US government should be defending its companies right not be the tip of the spear attacking its companies so when we so we we talk about a lot okay what is the experience of um okay if the US government comes after you I I think the real issue is that when the US government does that to its tech industry um it's basically just Open Season around the rest of the world right I mean the the EU I I pull these numbers the EU has fined the tech companies more than $30 billion over the last I think it was like 10 or 20 years holy [ __ ] so when you when you think about it like okay there's it's like you know hundred million here a couple billion dollars there but what what it I think really adds up to is this is sort of like a kind of eu-wide policy for how they want to deal with American Tech it's almost like a tariff and I think the US government basically gets to decide how are they going to deal with that right because if the if the US government if if um if some other you know country was screwing with another industry that we cared about the US government would probably find some way to put pressure on them but I think what happened here is actually the complete opposite the US government led the the kind of attack against the companies which then just made it like the EU is basically and all these other places just free to just go to town on all the American companies and do whatever you want but I mean look obviously like I don't want to come across as if like we don't have things that we need to do better obviously we we do and when we mess something up we deserve to be held accountable for that and and and just like everyone else um I do think that the American Technology industry is a bright spot in the American economy I think it's a strategic Advantage for the United States that we have a lot of the strongest uh companies in the world and I I think it should be part of the US's strategy going forward to defend that and um and it's one of the things that I'm optimistic about with President Trump is I think he just wants America to win and um and I think think some of this stuff like the the other the other governments who are kind of pushing on on this stuff it's you know it's like at least the US has the rule of law right so the government can come after you for something but you still get your day in court and the courts are pretty fair and you know so we've basically done a pretty good job of Defending ourselves and when we when we've chosen to do that basically we we have a pretty good rate of winning um it's just not like that in every other country around the world like if other governments decide that they're going to go after you don't always get kind of a a clear shake at at kind of Defending yourself on on on the rules so I think to some degree if the US tech industry is going to continue being really strong um I I do think that the US government has a role in um in basically defending it abroad and that's one of the things that I'm optimistic about will will happen in this Administration well I think this Administration uniquely has felt the impact of not being able to have free speech because this was the this is the administration where Trump was famously kicked off of Twitter that was a huge issue like after January 6th like they removed the at the time the sitting president was kind of crazy to remove that person from social media because you've decided that he incited a riot um so for him without free speech without people without podcast without social media they probably wouldn't have had a chance because the mainstream narrative other than Fox News was so clearly against him the majority of the television entities and print entities were against him the majority of them so if without social media without podcast the they don't stand a chance so they're uniquely aware of the importance of giving people their Voice free speech but you do have to be careful about misinformation and you do have to be careful about just outright lies and propaganda complaints or propaganda campaigns rather and how do you differentiate well I I think that there are a couple of different things here one is this is something where I think X and Twitter just did it better than us on on factchecking we took the critique around factchecking sorry around misinformation we put in place this fact checking program um which basically empowered these thirdparty fact Checkers they could Mark stuff false and then we would downright it in the algorithm I think what what Twitter and X have done with Community notes I think is just a better program um rather than having a small number of fact Checkers you get the whole Community to weigh in when people usually disagree on something tend to agree on how they're voting on on on a note that's a good sign to the community that this is there's actually like a broad consensus on this and then you show it and you're showing more information not less right so you're not using the fact check as a signal to show less you're using the the community note to provide real context um and and Show additional information so I think that that's better um for when you're talking about like nation states um or people interfering a lot of that stuff is best rooted out at the level of kind of accounts doing phony things so you get like whether it's like China or Russia or Iran or like one of these countries they'll set up these networks of of fake accounts and Bots and they coordinate and they post on each other's stuff to make it seem like it's authentic and kind of convince people it's like wow a bunch of people must think this or something and the way that you identify that is you build AI systems that can basically detect that those accounts are not behaving the way that a human would and when we find that that there's like some bot that's operating an account how how do you differentiate how do you figure that out it just I mean there are some things that a person just would never do right so um have you met Lex fredman yes right yeah yeah he might not be well pass your he going to take yeah is he going to take is he G to make a million actions in a minute it's like yeah probably not okay so it's that well I mean it's it's more subtle than that I think like these guys are pretty sophisticated and it's an adversarial space so um so we find some technique and then they um they basically kind of update their their techniques but but we have a team of their it's effectively like intelligence Counter Intelligence folks counterterrorism folks AI folks who are Building Systems to identify um what are these accounts uh that are just not behaving the way that people would and how are they interacting and and then sometimes you you you trace it down and um and sometimes you get some tips from different intelligence uh agencies and then you can kind of piece together over time it's like oh this network of people is actually some kind of fake cluster of accounts and that's against our policies and we just take them all off um but what how do you how are you sure like is there a 100% certainty that that we're that you are definitely getting a group of people that are Bad actors or is it just people that have unpopular opinions no I don't think it's that for this I think um but what I'm saying is how do you determine like how do you at what percentage of accuracy are you determining do you ever accidentally think that people that are going to get moderated are actually just real people um yes I think that's I think for the specific problem around these like large coordinated groups doing kind of like election interference or something it's a large enough group we have like a bunch of people analyzing it it's like they study it for a while I think we're probably pretty accurate on that but I actually think one of the bigger issues that we have in our moderation system is this Precision issue that you're talking about and that is actually of all the things that we announced this week in terms of how we're going to update the content policies changing the content filters to have to require higher confidence and precision is actually going to be the thing that reduces the vast majority of the censorship mistakes that we make right the um you know the the removing the fact Checkers and replacing them with Community notes I think it's a good step forward like a very small percent of content is fact checked in in the first place so it's is that going to make the hugest difference I'm not sure um I think it'll be a positive step though um and we we like opened up some content policies so some stuff that was restricted before we opened up okay that's good it'll mean that's some set of things that might have been censored before or not but by far the biggest set of issues we have and and you and I have talked about a bunch of issues like this over the years is like it's just okay you have some classifier that's it's trying to find say like drug content right people decide okay it's like the opioid epidemic is a big deal we need to do a better job of cracking down on drugs and drug sales right I don't I don't want people dealing drugs on our networks so we build a bunch of systems that basically go out and try to automate finding people who are who are dealing with dealing drugs and then you basically have this question which is how precise do you want to set the classifier so do you want to make it so that the system needs to be 99% sure that someone is is dealing drugs before taking them down uh do you want to to be 90% confident 80% confident and then those correspond to amounts of um you know I guess the the statistics term would be recall what percent of the bad stuff are you finding so if you require 99% confidence then maybe you only actually end up taking down 20% of the bad content um whereas if you reduce it and you say okay we're only going to require 90% confidence now maybe you can take down 60% of the bad content but let's say you say no we really need to find everyone who's doing this bad thing and it doesn't need to be as as severe as as dealing drugs it could just be um I mean it could be any any kind of content of uh any kind of category of harmful content um you you start getting to some of these classifiers might have you know 80 85% Precision in order to get 90% of the bad stuff down but the problem is if you're at you know 90% Precision that means one out of 10 things that the classifier takes down is not actually problematic and if you filter if you if you kind of multiply that across the billions of people who use our services every day that is millions and millions of posts that are basically being taken down that are innocent and and upon review we're going to look at and be like this is ridiculous that this thing got taken down which I mean I think you've had that experience and we've talked about this for for a bunch of stuff over time and um but it really just comes down to this question of where do you want to set the classifiers so one of the things that we're going to do is basically set them to be um to be require more confidence which is this trade-off it's going to mean that we will maybe take down a smaller amount of the harmful content but it will also mean that we'll dramatically reduce the amount of people who whose accounts were taking off um for a mistake which is just a terrible experience right it's like okay you're you're going about your day and then one day you wake up and you're like oh my WhatsApp account just got dis like deactive ated because it's connected to a Facebook account and the Facebook account um is uh is is is or like I'm I'm using on the same phone as a Facebook account where uh like we made some enforcement mistake and thought you were doing something bad that you weren't because our classifiers were set to too low of precision has that happened before oh yeah where their WhatsApp app got canceled as well yeah because I mean there there are a bunch so your Facebook app gets taken out like say if you have a Facebook and you have like a sock puppet account and the sock puppet account you post offensive memes and you're generally gross yeah if that if you get caught for that does your WhatsApp get killed not for memes but but go back to like a very severe thing like let's say someone is terrorist let's say the most severe sure yeah let's say someone is is like terrorist content they're planning some attack okay so we take down their account right but then let's say that person can just go then sign up with another account but I think like you know how does WhatsApp get connected to that though oh well if it's I I mean we run these different services and if they're on the same phone it's basically you know it's one thing that you know it's basically Regulators or governments will come to us and say okay it's you're you're clearly not doing enough if you kick someone off for terrorism and then they can just like sign up for another account on the phone right okay you're also they also think okay well we're not doing enough if we deactivate their Facebook account because they're like planning a terrorist attack but we let them use all our other services right right if you're aware yeah yeah so so if we if our systems think that someone is terrorist then you probably need to deactivate their their access to all the different accounts yeah they can't get on threads threads Instagram yeah um yeah so that makes sense so it's you can understand how you get there but then you just get to this question around the Precision and the confidence level and then you're you're just making all these mistakes at scale and it's just unacceptable but I I think it's it's a very hard calculation of like where do you want to be because on the one hand like I get why people kind of come to us and they're like no you need to do a better job finding more of the terrorism or the drugs and and all this stuff but you know over time the technology will get better and it'll get more precise but at any given point in time that's the choice that we have to make is do we want to make more mistakes airing on the side of of just like blowing away innocent people's accounts right um or do we want to um get a higher a somewhat higher percent of of the bad stuff off and I think that there's some just some bance that you need to strike on this we were having a conversation yesterday Mel Gibson and I about how that can get weird was it Theo it might have been Theo I think it was Theo where that can get weird because I think like if you're a person and you work at some accounting firm but you like posting about stuff but you don't want it to come back and reflect on your life you want to [ __ ] post you want to post jokes you want to be silly you should be able to be anonymous I I think there's nothing wrong with that I don't think just because you state your opin people should be able to search where you sleep that doesn't make any sense to me but if you're going to allow Anonymous accounts you're definitely going to open up the door to Bad actors having enormous blocks of accounts where they can use either AI or just programs where they have like specific answers I'm sure you've seen that before it's it's come up on Twitter multiple times where they found hundreds of sock puppet accounts tweeting the exact same thing so you you've literally word for word even certain words in caps like either keep people are copy or pasting it or there's an email campaign that's getting legitimate people to do it or these are fake people you're going to have if you're going to have Anonymous accounts which I think you should because I think whistleblowers I think the the benefits of anonymous reporting on important things that the general public needs to know about especially whistleblower type stuff you have to have some ability to be anonymous but you all if you're going to do that you're also going to have the possibility these aren't real people that these are paid actors these are paid people or not people at all or they're running programs and they're doing this to try to sway public opinion about very important issues yeah um a lot of what we've seen too I me there's the anonymous accounts also just over time I think a lot of the kind of more interesting conversations have shifted from the public sphere to more private ones so WhatsApp groups um private groups on Facebook um I'm sure you have this experience where like maybe 10 years ago you would have posted your kind of quick takes on on whatever social media you're using now you know the stuff that I post on on Facebook and Instagram it's like I put time into into making sure that that's kind of good content that that I want to be seen broadly and then like most of the jokes that I make are like with my friends in WhatsApp right in groups um so yeah I I think that's sort of that's kind of where the world is more broadly now yeah yeah no I think so for jokes for that kind of stuff with for comedians for sure because also we'll say things that we don't really mean we just say it because it's a funny thing to say I think everyone does for sure yeah which is just a weird thing about taking things out of context particularly on social media where people love to do that but there is this problem of like let's just say that you're a country that's involved in some sort of an international conflict and you have this ability to get out this fake narrative and just spread it widely about all sorts of things you're accusing this other government of all sorts of things that aren't true yeah and it just muddies the water of reality for a lot of people yeah and that's why that side of things the kind of governments running these broad manipulation campaigns I mean we're not letting off the gas on that at all I think every like most most categories of bad stuff that we're policing everyone agrees is bad right no one's sitting there defending that terrorism is good right child exploitation or drugs or IP violations or people insiding violence or it's like most of the stuff is bad people clearly believe that um that um you know election interference and foreign government manipulation of content is bad so we we have this is the type of stuff that the vast majority of our energy goes towards that and we're not changing our approach on any of that the two categories that I think have been very politic ized are misinformation because who gets to judge or what's false and what's true um you may just not like my opinion on something and then you know people think it's false but it but it's uh but I think that that one's really tricky and the other one is um is basically what you know what people refer to as hate speech which is I think also comes from a good place of you know wanting to crack down on that of um of wanting to promote more inclusion and and and belonging and people feeling um feeling good and like having a a pluralistic society that can um that can basically have all these different communities coexist except everyone yeah but I think the problem is is that you know you just all these things are on a spectrum and when you go too far on them um you I think on on that side we just basically got to this point where there were these things that you just like couldn't say which were mainstream discourse right so you know it's like Pete Heth is going to you know probably be defending his nomination for Secretary of Defense on on the senate floor and I think one of the points that he's made is that he thinks that women shouldn't be able to be in certain combat roles and until we updated our policies that wouldn't have been a thing that you could have said on our platforms because it would call for the exclusion of a protected category of people and so and it's like okay like on its on its face yeah calling for the exclusion of a protected category that seems that like that's okay there's like legal protections there's stuff but okay if it's like okay to say on the floor of Congress you should probably be able to debate it on social media so um so I think some of the stuff I think well-intentioned went too far needs to just get rationalized a bit but but it's those two categories misinformation and hate speech I think are the ones that got politicized um all the other ones which is the vast majority of of the stuff that we do is um I think people generally agree that it's that it's good and we need to go after it but then you just get into this problem of the mistakes like you're talking about okay well what confidence level do do people want us to have um in in our enforcement and at what point would people rather us kind of say okay I'm not sure that that's um that that one is causing an issue um so do you so on balance maybe we should just you know leave that person's account out because the pain of just nuking someone's account when you're not sure or you making mistake is like that's pretty real too right yeah very very complicated yeah it's it's all all very nuanced and you know you made a point earlier about the the government supporting its companies that it would be a good thing for the government to support its companies it makes sense it's an American company I think the issue that we're dealing with is companies as we're describing them have never existed before right there's never been a thing like Facebook before there's never been a thing like Twitter before X there's never been a thing like Instagram these are new things in terms of the Imp that it has on Society on opinions on conversations on distribution of information there's never been a thing like this that the government didn't control so it makes sense from their perspective continuing the patterns of behavior that they've always exhibited which is to have control over the media I mean there has been CIA operatives that have been in major newspapers forever there's always been that there's always been this sort of input that the government had in mainstream media narratives they are in a position now where they're losing that there they've essentially lost it and especially with this last the push during covid deteriorated as you were saying before the opinion and the respect that people have for the facts that are coming from mainstream journalism in a way that I've never seen before in my life where an enormous percentage of the population does not trust mainstream media anymore so well what do they trust they trust social media well who's running that well a bunch of people figured it out and invented it well no [ __ ] that like we got to crack down on that like we've got to get our hands on this which is what we saw during covid which is we saw during the Biden administration's attempt to remove the hunter Biden laptop story from Twitter and from all these different things that we saw happen the way they contacted you guys what they're trying to do with getting you to remove real information about vaccine side effects like that this is like this new attempt to crack down on this new thing which is a distribution Outlet that's far more successful than anything they've ever controlled before and they have no control of it right they they had CBS they had NBC they had when they had the New York Times and all these Washington Post when they were in control of narratives in that way it was so much easier there there wasn't some sort of Pirate Radio voice that came on and said hey guys look here's the the latest studies that show this is not true here's why they're lying about that here's why they're lying about this and now that's what you get all day long on X it's all day long is like dissolving Illusions MH and that's a completely new thing that probably led to Trump getting elected yeah I mean the causality there is tricky but um because there's a lot of things I a lot it's um without it he probably doesn't get elected um it's yeah it's tough know I mean I I do come back to this point that there were every major incumbent lost their elections around the world this year but I think that's also it might be it might be because of that revealing how how kind of Incorrect and and dishonest I think some of these governments were yes yeah so I think that that's that's quite possible and I mean I do think that there is this cycle that goes on where you know within a society it's not just the government that has power there's like certain people who in these like culturally Elite positions and you know journalists um TV news anchors like who are the people who people broadly trust right they're they're not all in government they're like um a lot of a lot of people um in other positions it's like who are the people that that uh basically people look to and um I think that's basically it needs to shift for the internet age and I think a lot of the people who um people looked to before they're kind of realizing hey they weren't super honest about a lot of these issues that we that we face and I think that that's partially why you know social media isn't a monolithic thing it's not that people trust Facebook or X they trust the creators and the voices that that they feel like are being authentic and giving them valuable information on there so there's I think going to be just this whole new class of creators who basically become the new kind of cultural Elites that people look at and are like okay these are the people who give it to me straight and I think that that's that's a thing that is maybe it's it's possible because of social media um I think it's also just the internet more broadly I I think podcasting is obviously a huge and important part of that too um I me I I don't know to what extent you feel like you kind of got to be large like because of social media or just it's or just the podcasting platforms that you used but um but I think that this is like a very big sea change in terms of like who are the voices that matter and you know what we do is we we try to build a platform that gives people a voice but I that there's this wholesale generational shift in who are the people who are being listened to and I think that that's like a very fascinating thing that is going on because I I I think that that's like what is what's going on here it's not it's it's not just the government um and people saying hey we we want like a very big change here I think it's just like a wholesale shift in saying we just want different people who we actually trust um who who are actually going to like tell us the truth then like and not give us like the [ __ ] opinions that you're supposed to say but like the type of stuff that I would actually like when I'm sitting with my in my living room with my friends like the stuff that we know is true like who are the people who kind of have the courage to actually just say that stuff um I don't know I think that whole like cultural Elite Class needs to get repopulated with people who people actually trust yeah um the problem is these people that are starting these jobs they're coming out of universities and in the universities are indoctrinated into these ideas as well it's it's very difficult to be a person who stands outside of that and takes unpopular positions you get socially ostracized and people are very they're very hesitant to do that and they would rather just keep their mouth shut and talk about it in quiet conversation and that's what we experience which is another another argument for anonymous accounts I think you should have Anonymous accounts I think you should be a like if there's something like Co mandates or some things that you're dealing with and you don't want to get fired because of it you should be able to talk about it and you should be able to post facts and information and what you've learned and uh you know anecdotal experiences with people in your family that had vaccine side effects and not worry about losing your job which people were worried about which is so crazy and you know and you're seeing uh a lot of the people that used to be in mainstream media got fired and now they're trying to do the sort of podcast thing but they're trying to do it like a mainstream media person so they're like gaslighting during podcasts and people are like hey [ __ ] face like this you can't do that here it doesn't work yeah well it's a new medium I mean I know I'm sure you know the history on this it's like when when people transition from Radio to TV the initial TV anchors were the same radio people but just like being filmed while speaking on the radio but it turned out it actually was a completely different type of person that you need because on your radio is just like your voice and your Cadence and all that it's like you know the whole phrase it's like you've got a good radio voice right it's like um okay on TV you need to be telegenic right you need to kind of has have Charisma in that Medium it's like a completely different thing and um I think that that's going to be true for the internet too it's you know it's not as cut I think part of it is the format right the fact that you do these like two three-hour episodes I mean I hated doing TV because you know I basically got started I started Facebook when I was 19 and I was good at some things very bad at others I was good at coding and like real bad at at kind of like talking to people and explaining what I was doing and I just like had these experiences early on where I'd go on TV and like it wouldn't go well and they'd like cut to they'd cut it to some down to some random sound bite and I'd like look stupid and then like and then basically like I'd get super nervous about about like going on TV because I knew that they were just going to cut it in some way that I was going to look like a [ __ ] idiot and like and so I'm just like this sucks right so so I just like it's it's kind of a funny thing about like it's like in some ways it's like okay at the same time I was you know gaining confidence being able to like build more and more complicated products and it's like even as an early 20s person I was like I could do this and then on the kind of TV and comm's public side I was like this is a disaster every time I go out it's worse and worse and worse and it just get but um but I mean it's it's one of the reasons why I think on the internet like there's no reason to cut it to a 4minute sound bite conversation it's like I think part of what what makes it authentic is like we can just I mean these are complex issues we can unpack it for hours and and probably still have hours more stuff to talk about it just it's I I don't know I I think it's just more real yeah it's definitely that and the other thing about television that's always going to hold it back is the fact that every conversation gets interrupted every x amount of minutes because you have to cut to a commercial so you you really can't get into depth even Bill Mar show is only an hour you know you have all these people talking over each other then you sit down with one person for short amount of time it's just not enough time for important subjects it's also a lot of them for whatever reason want to do it in front of an audience which is the worst way to get people to talk like when imagine these disasters that you had if there was like 5,000 people staring at you in a TV crowd as well so there's that added element which is so not normal and not conducive to having a conversation where you're talking about nuanced things yeah where you have to like think you have to be able to pause and and not concern yourself being entertaining from of these [ __ ] people just sitting there staring at you yeah and and also like when you're having a conversation it like I don't know it's like when you start talking about something your kind of subconscious kicks in you start thinking about the the topic so it's like you might not actually have the thing that you want to say until like five minutes later and right I mean it's like when we started this conversation I think like the first few minutes were just kind of slow it's like warming up like I'm like okay kind of like downloading into my memory like how how am I going to like you know it's like how am I going to you know just explain these different things but it's um yeah know I just think that that's sort of how people work what's also like it's conversations are like a dance you know one person can't be dancing at another speed and the other person is going slow like you kind of have to find the Rhythm that you're going to talk with and then you have to actually be interested in what you're talking about that's another thing that they are at a huge disadvantage of in mainstream media is like they're just doing that because that's their job you know they probably don't even know a lot about climate change they probably don't really understand too much about what space SpaceX is trying to accomplish but they're just reporting on it yeah I mean I'm sure there's the and a lot of the people I've met there I think are good people it's just a tough format terrible format yeah and the problem is they get locked into that format and no one trusts them and then they leave and they go yeah but you were just lying to us about this that and the other thing and now I'm supposed to believe you're one of the good guys you're one of the Straight Shooters now yeah well getting back to the original point this is why I think you know it makes sense to me that the government didn't want you to succeed and to have the sort of unchecked power that they proce ceed social media to to have and I think one of the benefits that we have now of the Trump Administration is that they have clearly felt the repercussions of a limited amount of free speech of free speech limitations censorship government overreach if anybody saw it look it there's I don't know what the actual impact of the hunter Biden laptop story would have been I don't know but there's many people that think it probably amounted to millions of votes overall in the country of people that were on the fence the people that weren't sure who they're going to vote for if they found out the hunterbiden laptop was real they're like oh this is [ __ ] their family's [ __ ] crazy and they would have voted for Trump that's possibly real and if that's possibly real that could be defined as election interference and all that stuff scares the [ __ ] out of me that kind of stuff scares the [ __ ] out of me when the government gets involved in what could be termed election interference but through some some weird loophole it's legal whereas some I don't think that the pushing for social media companies to censor stuff was legal I mean it's like that's I mean there's all this stuff about what like people talk about the first amendment and okay these these Tech platforms should should offer free speech like the first amendment it's that I think is a philosophical principle the First Amendment doesn't apply to companies in what in our content moderation it's more of an American ethos about how think that that um you know best dialogue is carried out but the First Amendment does apply to the government that's like the whole point right the government is not allowed to censor this stuff so at some level I do think that you know having people in the administration calling up the guys on our team and yelling at them and cursing and threatening repercussions if we don't take down things that are true is like it's pretty bad it sounds illegal I would love to hear it I wish somebody recorded those conversations would be great to listen to somebody could animate them maybe poly Tunes the a lot of the material is is public I mean it's I mean Jim Jordan LED this whole investigation in Congress I mean it was basically I think about this as like you know what Elon did on the Twitter files when he took over that company I think Jim Jordan basically did that for the rest of the industry with the the Congressional investigation that he did and we just turned over like all of the documents and everything that we had um to them and they basically put together this report and the people that actually did call for censorship what was the response to all this uh to what to the to the investigation yes I don't know I don't know did was anybody held accountable was there any I mean any repercussions I mean they lost the election yes so that's it well in a democracy I mean that's kind of right um um right but if if what they did was illegal do you not think that some steps should be put in place to make sure that people are punished for that and that that never happens again it seems that that has a massive impact on the way our country goes if that's election interference and I think it is that has a massive impact on the direction of our country yeah well the co thing I don't think was election interference as much as it was just like meddling where it shouldn't have but yeah no I mean it's I'm for me to say you know like what specific retribution or Justice should happen to anyone who is involved in these things but I think your point about let's make sure this doesn't happen again yeah is um is the one that I'm more focused on right because then it's the thing that I reflect on on my journey on all this which is like okay yeah so we didn't take down the stuff that was true but we did generally defer to the government on some of these policies that in retrospect I probably wouldn't knowing what I know now and um and I I just think that that's that's sort of the journey that we've been on is like okay we start the thing focused on free expression go through some like pretty crazy times in the world get it pressure tested see where we basically ended up doing stuff that led to a slippery slope that we weren't happy with the conclusion and like try to reset and that's sort of the moment that we're at now is is trying to just rationalize um a bunch of a bunch of the policies and and look I mean obviously crazy things can happen in the future that might unearth something that I haven't um you know some some kind of angle on this that I haven't um thought enough about yet so I know I'm sure I'm not done making mistakes in the world but um but I think at this point we have a much more thorough understanding of what the space is and I I I think our our kind of values and principles on this are likely going to be much more durable going forward um and and I think that that's probably a good thing for the internet I think it's a great thing for the internet I was very happy with your announcement I'm very happy that you took those steps I'm very happy you brought Dana White aboard oh he's awesome been talking to him for a while about that I mean he's like talk about like an amazing entrepreneur right it's like I just want like because I control our company I have the benefit of not having to convince the board not to fire me right it's like normal corporate environment it's like basically the CEO just tries to like you know they're just trying to convince the board to like let them have their job and pay them more it's like all right the board doesn't pay me except for security and um and I'm not worried about losing my job because I control the majority of the voting in the company so I actually get to use our board to like have the smartest people who I can get to have around me help work on these problems so it's like all right who are the people I want like I just want like the best entrepreneurs and people have created different things and like I mean Dana is like this guy who I mean he basically took the sport from being this like I think it was viewed as like this pretty marginal thing when he got started right I think John McCain was trying to outlaw it and um and you know now it's like I think it and F1 are the two fastest growing sports in the world it's got hundreds of millions of people viewing it it's like I mean what Dana's done with the UFC is like one of the most legendary business stories and um and the brand is beloved and and I think he's just um so he's like a worldclass entrepreneur and he's just like a he's got a strong backbone and I think part of what the conversation that I had with him around joining our board was okay like we have a lot of governments and folks around the world putting a lot of pressure on our company and like we need some like strong people who are going to basically you know help help advise us on how to handle some of these situations and um and so yeah that's but but yeah I mean this is running this company is not for the faint of heart I mean you definitely there's definitely a lot of pressure from from like all these different governments and and then then it's like okay I could spend all my time doing that but I'm not even a politician like I want to I just want to spend my time building things right so so it's um so yeah I think Dana is gonna be great he's the best great entrepreneur I agree with everything you said about him without him none of the UFC would have ever taken place the way it did I mean you needed the fertita brothers they had to come in with all the money and the vision and it's really funny because Eddie Bravo and I you know we've been fans for so long Eddie Bravo and I went to a live event in the 90s I was working for the UFC as a backstage interviewer and he went there with Ricky rocket you know Ricky rocket from Poison no he's a [ __ ] black belt under the machados he's legit super legit really nice guy too anyway so Ricky rocket and him were at the uh UFC and we were talking about it in the '90s like you know what this sport needs cuz we were in love with it like this but we were marshal artists where like the sport needs some billionaires who just throw a ton of money at it and just get it huge and then the fra Brothers come along billionaires with a ton of money who are huge fans of the sport just love the sport you know we're hiring people like Frank Shamrock to come in and train them and work out they were taking Jiu-Jitsu with John Lewis and they were really getting into it and so then they buy the UFC for like $2 million which is probably the greatest purchase ever except they were 4 plus million dollar in the whole when they fi financed the ultimate fighter and then that was 2005 and then this one fight takes place with Stephan B and Forest Griffin on television it's so wild and so crazy that millions of people start tuning in the sports born then you have Chuck Liddell who was the champion at the time who was the most fan-friendly Champion you could ever have just a [ __ ] Berserker with just psychopath with a [ __ ] head tattoo and a mohawk crushing people in his prime he was the perfect poster guy for the UFC cuz he was just smashing people and then throwing his arms back like in a cage it was nuts I'm sure you've seen a lot of Chuck liell fights right yeah it is it was just the the whole thing took off but without Dana it would have never taken place the guy's tireless that man I could call him up I'll call him up at like 2 o'clock in the morning sometime like there's some fight going on and I'll say hey this is going on next weekend I'm so [ __ ] pumped and we talk for hours for hours he just wants to talk about fights he's like so locked in like all the time you know and he's he's just like so driven and now that he's healthy like oh my God he's got what Gary Brea has done for him is incredible he lost all this weight got super thin real fit super healthy he doesn't [ __ ] around with alcohol anymore he just eats healthy food he looks great now he's get even more energy yeah it's incredible well we're lucky to have some of it yeah we are and you know what we're also lucky that you got into Jiu-Jitsu cuz I think I think that had an effect on you you look different when you walked in here today you look thicker you look like a different guy you do you look like a Jiu-Jitsu guy now it's funny I saw your neck I'm like his neck's bigger your neck is bigger good are you using iron neck or is it just for training I do like I do like iron neck but but it's um but when I started training not just Jiu-Jitsu but striking I was like right I want to find a way to do this where I don't like like hurt my brain right it's like all right like I need to I'm going to be running this company for a while I would like to you know like stay stay healthy and not take too much damage and so I think the number one thing you need to do is well in addition to having good partners is um have a strong neck yes so yeah so yeah no I I take that I take that pretty seriously it's very important strong neck is great for Jiu-Jitsu as well cuz it's a weapon like in certain positions like head arm chokes you need a neck yeah it's a weapon and you know also for defending things and just for overall stability but for striking it's very like Mike Tyson in his prime he had a [ __ ] 20in neck yeah it's crazy his neck is like bigger than his his face a photo of him in a suit it's the craziest photo it's like his neck starts at the top of his ears and he just goes straight down when he was a champ when he was a tank aming yeah the next's very important but it's also like you know you're doing it very smart you're bringing in Dave Camario he's awesome amazing he's awesome you're bringing in all these like super talented people to train with you too which is really important and just learn systematically probably the way you've learned all these other things which is really so fascinating to me about MMA and and Jiu-Jitsu in particular is the general public has this knuckle dragging Mead sort of perspective and then I'm like let me introduce you to Mikey mamichi yeah well there's there's a range there's a range from Mikey right but Mikey is one of the elite of the elite and he's about as far from that I love Mikey's good guy he's super good guy he's super kind and and unbelievably brilliant and eccentric and just and just so dedicated to Jiu-Jitsu right he's I'm glad I'm glad that he's over at the UFC now yes I am too yeah well I'm glad a guy like that exists I I like because I like I'm like okay I know you think that let me show you this guy and then I'm like let me show you what it really is let me introduce you to these people cuz they're the nicest people there's no better stress reliever in the world than Jiu-Jitsu or martial arts there's no better you you leave there you're the kindest person in the world you just like he all of your aggressions out of your system yeah and it's a phenomenal stress reliever because regardless of what you're going through day-to-day with Facebook and meta and all the different projects you have going on it's not as hard as someone trying to choke you on conscious it's not as acute I think it's like sometimes you have someone trying to choke you unconscious slowly multi- perod that's um but I think that sometimes in bus the cycle time is so long that it is very refreshing to just have a feedback loop that's like oh I like had my hand down so I got punched in the face it's like that's like that's um but yeah no I it's it's really important to me for balance I mean I I basically try to train every morning I'm either doing general fitness or or kind of MMA and do sometimes grappling sometimes striking or some both but um it got to the point where I I I I tore my ACL training I was probably um at that point I didn't have I wasn't integrated between my weight training and my fighting training so I think I was probably overdoing it so now now we basically I'm I'm just trying to do this in a cohesive way which I I think will be more sustainable but when I when I tore my ACL first of all everyone of the company was like ah F we're going to get so many more emails now it's like that that he can't that he can't do this um and then and then I sat down with Priscilla and I expected her to be like you're an idiot like what do you expect you're like you I was in my late 30s at the time and but she was like no she's like when you heal your ACL you better go back to fighting and I'm like what do what do you mean she's like you are so much better to be around now that you're doing this you have to fight and so that's hilarious yeah so and um isn't it funny that like that's completely contrary to the way most people if they're outside of it would perceive it I mean it it definitely takes the edge off things right it's like after like a couple of hours of doing that in the morning it's just like yeah it's like nothing else that day is going to stress you out that much right you can just you can just deal with it um voluntary adversity yeah yeah no it's good it's good it's also good I think to be a little bit tired like it's like it just it's I love that feeling of just like you're not like exhausted um and sometimes you get a session and you just go so hard and I need to like just go to sleep or something but yeah um it's also good to know that you can kill people that's that's a good thing to know it's a good thing to know if something goes sideways I guess there's a there's a certain Confidence from that it's an important skill if you could give it in a pill if you could sell it in a pill everybody would buy it yeah 100 no one would say I'd like to be the vulnerable guy walking around with a bunch of [ __ ] assassins no one would say that they would say how much is the pill oh it's $2 oh give me one of those pills you take the pill everybody would take that pill well it exists it's just not a pill it's a long journey of pain and discipline and and trial and error and learning and being open-minded and being objective and understanding position and asking questions and having good training partners and absorbing information and really being diligent with your skill acquisition work which is a one of the most important and neglected parts of Jiu-Jitsu because training is so fun everybody just wants to roll you know where really the best way to do it is actually to drill and it's the most boring but really you should drill constantly just Jam those skills into your neurons where your brain knows exactly what you do in every position and it's such an intellectual Pursuit and most people don't think of it that way because you have to manage your mind while you're moving your body you're managing anxieties you're you're you're trying to figure out when to hit the gas and when to control position recover there's so much going on in training that applies to virtually any stressful thing that you'll ever experience in your life and along with it you get this skill where you can kill [Laughter] people you shouldn't kill people let me be clear I'm not saying it's a good thing to kill people I'm definitely not but I'm saying it's a good thing to if someone's trying to kill you and they absolutely can't because you could kill them easy that's way better it's a way better situation to be in yeah no it's it's great I it's it's open a lot of how I think about stuff I mean it's it is just interesting your point about like having a pill that allows you to just kind of know that you have this kind of physical ability it's um it's a superpower it's it's interesting because I I do think a lot of our society has become very like I don't know I don't even know the right word for it but it's like it kind of like neutered or like emasculated and it's there's like a whole energy in this that I I think it's it is very healthy in the right balance um I mean I think part of the reason every one of the things that I enjoy about it is I feel like I can just like express myself right it's like when you're running a company people typically don't want to see you being like this ruthless person who's like just like I'm just going to like crush the people I'm competing with but like but when you're fighting it's like no no that's like so I think in I think in some ways when people see me competing in the sport they're like oh no that's the real Mark it's like because it's it goes back to the all the media training stuff we were talking about when I'm going and giving my sound bites for two minutes it's like no it's like [ __ ] that guy it's like that's the real one it's but um well you definitely got a lot of respect in the martial arts Community people got super excited that you were so involved in it and so interested in it because anytime someone like yourself or like Tom Hardy or anyone like wow that guy's into it like wow anytime something like that happens there's like some new person who's a prominent person a very smart person it's really interested in it we all get very excited because we're like oh boy it's a very welcoming Community super I think there's a lot of a lot of sports that are like nah we don't want you it's not a jock Community it's super kind like Jiu-Jitsu people in particular they're some of the nicest PE it's my friends forever you know they'll be my friends for life yeah yeah no it's it's a it's a good crew I mean when I got hurt I I really kind of missed the guys I trained with it's like Dave has put together this this group it's basically these like all these young pro fighters who are kind of like up and coming like kind of early 20s but they've only been doing it for a few years so like I've been doing it for for a few years so that way it's like we kind of are have a more similar level of skill and they're all better than me but like but in terms of I'm like I was in my late 30s and they're in their early 20s it was sort of like they're kind of coming into becoming men I'm like sort of at the end of my fiscal Peak but it's like it's um it's uh it's it's a really good crew um yeah know it's a good crew and the competing thing is fun I can't wait to get back to that too I mean it's like basically I mean I was also doing it was so was basically some a group of pro Fighters and then a handful of meta Executives would do it and and basically we would just kind of like fight each other and it would be fun and and um and then one of them decided one day that they're like you know I think I'm getting pretty good at Jiu-Jitsu I'm going to go to a tournament and I was like all right good luck with that bro like I'm I'm not going to I'm not going to go to tournament it's like like like I don't want to go to a tournament get get embarrassed it's like like but then guy goes to the tournament he like does pretty well I'm like that guy it's like it's like okay it's like we go all the time and like and if he's doing well in a tournament it's like all right fine sign me up right it's like so I just like super competitive so this was like when was this it must have been I don't know I guess I I rolled into this tournament and I registered under my first and middle name so people didn't know who who I was and I had like sunglasses and a hat and I wore a CO mask and like and I and basically was like it wasn't until they called our names to step onto the mat that I was like all right take all the stuff off and the guy like uh what that's kind of a cheat code I mean they kind of kind of freak out yeah I think he was trying to figure out what was going on afterwards his his coach was like he's like I think that was Mark Zuckerberg who who just submitted me and the the coach is like no no no no way and it's like no I think that was he's like what you're fighting Mark Zu like get back in there it's like get go fight him he's like no he just submitted me it's that's very funny yeah man well Tom Hardy's doing that too right done multiple tournaments now yeah no I think I think um yeah I yeah I I I can't wait wait to get back to competing it's been it's been sort of a slow Journey on the the rehab it's sort of like learning twice but but we're we're getting there how far out are you oh no I'm done with the rehab now now I'm just ramping back how far out are you from surgery um 12 13 months so you did the Patel ten in graft right I did yeah yeah that's a rough one to come back from I did um the Patell attended graph on my left knee and it took me about a year I did the ACL from a kadav it's actually they use an Achilles tendon from a kadaver on my right knee and I was back to Jiu-Jitsu in six months H like full confidence in six months I was I was 100% recovered kicking the bag everything yeah yeah I how how um how old were you when you got those the first one I was 26 uh the second one I was 3 one 32 somewhere around there oh so so young yeah because my my doctor was basically like look you're at the you're like at the boundary you could go either way but if you want to compete again then I'd recommend doing the patella yeah I know they say that I don't agree with that I mean just from my own personal experience my doctor told me that the a from a cadav or when they use the Patel attending craft is 150% stronger than your natural ACL he said you'll be back to cuz I didn't have any miniscus damage on my right knee he's like you'll be back to 100% I have a lot of miniscus damage on my left knee unfortunately which is also part of the problem with the recovery of that one but the uh battal attendant graft the bone on the kneecap was painful forever in terms of like getting on my knees like training from my knees doing doing certain positions and even just stretching like you know putting my knees on the ground um sitting on my heels and then laying back it was [ __ ] painful it took forever to break all that scar tissue up and now it's fine it's fine now but obviously it's a long time ago yeah I can kind of do everything that I want at this point it's still like a little sore but I I I don't know I think that it's supposed to be a couple years until you like feel like it's fully I think it takes some time for the nerves to grow into it and all that did you incorporate peptides in your recovery I I didn't um do you hate healing do I hate healing no why didn't you use peptides I don't know I just took my doctor advice on it but don't don't do that anymore I mean next time there's other people to talk to yeah yeah I mean it's it's gone pretty well it's gone pretty I'm sure it goes pretty well but it would go quicker with P ties 100% for sure but it's been this interesting opportunity to like like I really don't want that to happen again so I I feel like I'm so much more focused on technique like the first time that I learned all this stuff I was like I was probably like a little too British about it m and just like musling through stuff and now um I don't know now I feel like I'm like really learning how to do this stuff correctly and I can do it way more effortlessly so it's it's um that's the goal how did it pop how did it pop I was I was like the end of a session and um so were two hours into training and I was doing like a few rounds and um and I basically I threw a leg kick and the other guy went to check it and I like leaned back to try to get around the check and just put too much t work on my knee um so it's the planted leg but um mine was a planted leg too yeah but it's I don't know Dave was like you know before that round Dave was like you're done I'm like no one more round it's you know you're too tired as well yeah and and I basically and I hadn't um you know I I basically had also just done a really hard kind of like leg workout the day before but I don't think the but the fight guys didn't know that so I I I I really just pushed too hard are you aware of uh knees over toes guy yeah have you done his stuff i' I've looked at it a bunch I mean the rehab thing I took really seriously I thought that was pretty interesting too it's um I don't want to like have to do a lot of rehabs like this one but to do one of them I actually thought was a pretty interesting experience because it's like week over week you're just getting back so much mobility and and ability to do stuff and yeah um no I feel like I'm I'm I don't know at this point I just like like probably half my weight training is is effectively kind of like rehab and joint health stuff and like wrists shoulders knee all that in addition to the big muscle groups yeah that's very smart the knee over toes guy stuff is particularly effective because it all comes from a guy that had a series of pretty catastrophic knee injuries and was plagued with weak knees his whole life and then developed a bunch of different methods to strengthen all all the supporting muscles around the knee that are really extraordinary everything from Nordic curls do you do those do you do Nordic curls um I should I should do more than I do yeah leg curls Nordic curls but Nordic curls in particular because you know you it's very difficult to do you got your body you lift your whole body up with your hamstrings um and all these different uh slant board squats and different lunges and split squats and all these different things which like really strengthen up all the supporting muscles around the knee better than anything that I've ever tried before and he's got like a whole program where it scales up and he puts it online for everybody he gives away a lot of information for free because he said look look when I was 11 years old I wish I had access to this so I'm going to put it out there for everybody great guy yeah cool but I can't recommend that stuff enough but I think what you're doing is like strengthening shoulder strengthening that's really the way to do it like you have to think of muscles in terms of like armor you know if you want to do this thing you know it's better to have good bumpers around your car if you might bump into other cars you know you don't want to just have raw sheet metal you know yeah yeah and and I think a lot of people just focus on like the big movements and in weight training and it's I know first of all for like a lot of fighting type stuff you you kind of want to be loose and like not super tight so um but yeah I mean I I just think like the The Joint stability stuff is you get older and you want to do this for a longer period of time it's it's good to do yeah it's huge it's um mobility in general it's just like so important you can compete in Jiu-Jitsu for a long time there's like all these Masters divisions and stuff and I see those old crazy looking seven-year-old dudes trying to kill each other yeah it's nuts it's great it is great but for real sincerely we're very happy the I I think I could speak rarely do but I think I can speak for the martial arts Community we're very happy you're bored it just it makes it it makes it fun that someone is you know a prominent intellectual very intelligent person who's really gotten fascinated by it because it does help to kill that sort of knuckle dragger perspective that a lot of people have about the sport no I I think it's super intellectual in terms of actually breaking the stuff down I mean both Jiu-Jitsu and like striking yeah you don't have time to think but like the reasoning behind why you kind of want to slip in certain ways and like the probability game that you're playing mhm is um I don't know I used to fence when I was in high school and I did that pretty competitively I was never like quite good enough to be like at the Olympic level but I was pretty good and um yeah we virtual fenced last time you were here yeah there you go and and like I you know I just remember I would like sit in my classes in high school and like sketch out combinations of moves and sequences for how to like faint and like and and kind of trick someone to get them out of position to be able to tap them and it's uh I I I feel like this is like a game in the same way right it's like I mean I think when when you're training you're not like slugging at each other that much you're just like you're you know playing tag yeah you're playing tag well the way the ties do it I think is the best and they're obviously some of the best fighters ever they fight a lot which is one of the reasons why they train the way they train but when you talk to people that train over there they're like you learn so much more when you're playing you know when you're doing when you're not trying to hurt each other you know then you really do learn the technique like and it gets fully ingrained in your system yeah it's great yeah you just have to be careful brain damage like you were talking about having an MMA fight are you still entertaining that I I want to I mean this is my thing it's like and I I think I probably will but we'll we'll see I mean it's 2025 I think is going to be a very busy year on the AI side yeah and I don't like I I think the idea of having a competition you really need to like get into the head space of like I'm going to fight someone this week and um so I need to I need to figure this out because I don't I don't know how with everything that's going on in AI I'm gonna have like a week or two where I can just get into this like I'm GNA go fight someone but but it's good it's good training um but and I would like to at some point um you know the thing about the ACL injury is I I kind of thought before this it's like all right I'm going to do some Jiu-Jitsu competitions I want to do one MMA fight like one kind of like Pro or competitive MMA fight and then I figured I'd go back to Jiu-Jitsu but I think tearing the ACL striking is a little more of a fluke I think you're much more likely to do that grappling so going through the ACL experience didn't make me want to like just exclusively go do the version where you're just attacking joints all day long right so I'm like all right I can take a few more punches to the face before we go back to that you can hurt yourself doing both of them you know there's really no Rhyme or Reason I blew my left ACL kickboxing my right ACL Jiu-Jitsu okay it Happ so equal opportunity yeah I mean this this like Tom Aspen famously blew his out against Curtis blades with a supporting leg just through a kick and his freak accidents weird things happen um you're it's a lot of explosive force with striking and sometimes that tears things more than slow controlled movements of Jiu-Jitsu especially if you have good training Partners yeah but jiujitsu isn't always slower controlled when you're especially when you're competing no especially when you're competing unless you're really really good like have you ever watch Gordon like Gordon never moves fast he doesn't have to he doesn't have to move fast he's just like always a step ahead of everybody have you talked to him at all oh yeah did you talk to John Doner um no I haven't you need to talk to John yeah I would be interested that's the greatest mind in Combat Sports no Gordon I don't say that lightly John Doner is the greatest mine in Combat Sports interesting by far he's a legitimate genius you know the whole story right the guy was a professor of philosophy at Stanford and just just or Columbia where was he I forgot think Columbia I think it was and then decides uh I'm just going to teach Jiu-Jitsu all day sleeps on the mats teaches all day long you know where's a Rashard anywhere he goes he's a freak and he's so [ __ ] smart like scary smart about all kinds of things it's not just Jiu-Jitsu you know he's got a A Memory like a steel Vice like he just holds on to thoughts and can repeat them his recalls insane he just a legitimate genius that became obsessed with jiu-jitsu and what he's done with Gordon and with Gary tonin and you know just a series of other athletes is nothing short of extraordinary you know just an interesting guy to have conversations with too have you seen him on Lex's show he's done a couple episodes of Lex and I watched I I saw the one that you did with him too yeah love the guy I mean again happy there's someone like that out there because when people have these ideas of what martial arts are and then you see a guy like that and you're like okay why I might have to rethink this yeah there's a there's a whole spectrum of people yeah yeah what is it done in terms of well a lot of one of the things that a lot of people said and I have too like nothing turns you into a Libertarian quicker than Jiu-Jitsu I don't know why that is I I think it's the hard work thing it's the cutting out all the [ __ ] and realizing how much of the things that we take as real things are just excuses and [ __ ] and weakness and just procrastinate there's a lot of things that we have that exist especially in like the business world and the corporate world and the education world that are just [ __ ] and they don't really have to be there and they're only there to sort of make up for hard work yeah um yeah I don't know I mean it's kind of just what I what I was saying before I think the for me it's uh just I think a lot of the corporate world is is like pretty culturally neutered and and I I I just think like having you know I I grew up I have three sisters no brothers um I have three daughters no Sons so I'm like surrounded by girls and women like my my whole life and it's like so I think um I don't know there's something the the the kind of masculine energy I think is is good and obviously you know Society has plenty of that but but I think corporate culture was really like trying to get away from it and I do think that there's just something it's like I don't know the these all these forms of energy are good and I think having a culture that like celebrates the aggression a bit more has its own merits that are really positive um and that's that has been that has been a kind of a positive experience for me just like having a thing that I can just like do with my guy friends and like yeah and it's just like we just like beat each other a bit I it's good it is good I agree it's good it just I I could see your point though about yeah corporate culture how when do you think that happened was that a slow shift because I think it used to be very masculine and I used to be the thing it was kind of hyper aggressive at one point now no and look and I think part of the the intent on all these things I think is good right it's I like I do think that if you're a woman going into a company it probably feels like it's too masculine it's like there isn't enough of the kind of the energy that that that you may naturally have and it probably feels like there are all these things that are set up that are biased against you and that's not good either because you want you want women to be able to succeed and and like have companies that can unlock all the value from having great people no matter you know what their background or gender you know but um but I think these things can always go a little far and I think it's one thing to say we want to be kind of like welcoming and make a good environment for everyone and I think it's another to basically say that masculinity is bad and I I just think we kind of swung culturally to that part of the the kind of the spectrum where you know it's all like okay masculinity is toxic we have to like get rid of it completely it's like no like it's both of these things are good right it's like you want like feminine energy you want masculine energy like I I think I think that that's like you're going to have parts of society that have more of one or the other I think that that's all good but um but I do think the corporate culture sort of had swung towards being this somewhat more neutered thing and I didn't really feel that until I got involved in martial arts which I think is still a more much more masculine culture and um so and not that it doesn't try to be inclusive in its own way but um but I think that there's just a lot more of that energy there and I just kind of realized it's like oh this that's how you become successful at martial arts you have to be at least somewhat aggressive yeah so but but yeah I mean there are these things there are like a few these things throughout your life where you just you have an experience and you're like where has this been my whole life and it just like it just turned on like a part of my brain that I was like okay yeah like this was this was a piece of the puzzle that should have been there and I'm glad it now is that I felt that way when I started hunting oh yeah hunting too yeah same kind of thing you so you've done a lot of that as well yeah well so I mean we have this Ranch out in Kawaii and there's invasive pigs and we on our Ranch we have um there's a lot of Albatross I don't know if they're endangered or just threatened and then there's the Hawaiian state bird the um the na goose is um that's I think endangered or or at least was until recently and like most of them in the world live in this small stretch um or at least most of them on Kawaii live in the small stretch that includes our Ranch so you constantly have these pigs that are just they multiply so quickly and we basically have to apply pressure to to the population or else they just get overrun and threaten the birds and the other wildlife and so and what I basically explained to my daughters who I also want to learn how to do this because I just feel like it's like look we we have this land we take care of it just like you mow the grass we need to make sure that these populations are in check it's part of what we do as like the stewards of this and we've got to do it and then if you if you have to kill something then you should you know obviously treat it with respect and you know use the the the meat to to make food and and um and and kind of celebrate in that way but it's it's a culture that I think it's um just an important thing for kids to grow up understanding like the circle of life right so you know teaching like teaching the kids all of you know what is is kind of you how you'd run a ranch how you'd run a farm um I think that that stuff it's good I mean because you know explaining to the kids what a tech company is is really abstract right so for a while my daughters were pretty convinced that my actual job was Mark's Meats which is our um our kind of ranch and like the C that we that we Ranch um I was like well not quite and you'll learn when you get older but um but I I think that there's something that's just like much more tangible about that than um you know taking them to the office and you know sitting in product reviews or something for for some like piece of software that we're writing well it's certainly a lot more Primal yeah yeah and if you do wind up eating that meat from the animal and you were there why the animal died like you put it all together like oh this is where meat comes from yeah yeah yeah which is another reason why things have become sort of emasculated because that energy is not necessary anymore to acquire meat you know that used to be the only way that people got meat you had to go hunt it so you had to go actually pull the trigger kill the animal yourself cut it up butcher it cook it you knew what you were doing yeah and although my favorite is bow bow and arrow MH I mean that's I think like the most that that feels like the most kind of sporting version of it yeah if you want to put it that way yeah I mean if you're just trying to get meat it's not the most effective the most effective is certainly a rifle but uh I prefer it because it's it requires more of you yeah and you just kind of go and hang out and and you have to be fit yeah especially if you're Mountain hunting you have to be really fit yeah you can't just be kind of in shape you got to be really fit if you want to Huff up the mountains and keep your heart rate at a certain level so that when you get to the top you can execute a shot calmly and then actually to carry the thing out yeah and carry the thing out yeah yeah yeah no I I'm I mostly mostly use a rifle just because it's so much more efficient um you know your conversion rate is so much higher but it's uh but yeah another what kind of bow do you have gosh I didn't get to do it this season but um do you know the company that makes it not off the top of my head I have a I have to know yeah no this is embarrassing this is embarrassing um I can get you hooked up yeah I it works okay do you know how old it is no it's it's not old okay I think it's it's like a just a compound bow that I got strung to my draw length and did you get someone to coach you yeah yeah who coached you um it's basically a bunch of the guys who who um you know help Run Security around the ranch okay yeah the thing about archery is just like martial arts uh one of the things that I learned when I teaching is that it's way easier to teach someone that knows nothing than to teach someone who learned something incorrectly the people who learn something incorrectly the moment um things got tense and they panicked they went back to the old ways um because it's sort of ingrained in their system so archery one of the things that's very important is proper form and then proper execution uh especially having a surprise shot and learning how to have a surprise shot is what do you mean yeah you don't know see that's this is the thing um in high pressure situations one of the most important things is to have um a shot process where you don't know exactly when the arrow is going off you just have a process where you're pulling through the shot and the shot breaks so it's a surprise shot so you put the pin on the target I use a a thumb trigger I use a I use a thing called an onx clicker and the reason why I use X clicker is like a hinge it gives you A two stage of the trigger right so as I'm at full draw I put slight pressure and I hear a click and that click means it's ready to go off with more pressure so I've gone through stage one now stage two is just concentrating on the shot process and knowing it's going to break and then there's no flinching there's no tweak there's no there's no thing that people do when they have a a finger trigger they they twitch because you're your body is anticipating the shock of the bow and when you're doing that you can be off by 6 in 4 Ines 5 in all over the place because you're moving you're moving while you're you're shooting when you're doing it with a rifle it's very different because obviously a rifle is far faster yeah and then you have a scope so you you know you're you're zoomed in many magnifications and all you have to do is just slowly squeeze and if you're smart you'll be prone or you'll have your rifle rested on a tripod or something where you have a good steady it's much easier with a bow it's very different cuz you're holding with your arm so you have to have the proper form you have to have the proper posture and then there's this thought process and my friend Joel Turner who is a sniper created a whole system for people called shot IQ he's got this whole online system of developing the proper execution of a shot when you see like tournament archers when they go to Vegas so what a Vegas tournament is you have three targets and they have to shoot 30 arrows at a time so they shoot 10 in this one 10 in that one 10 in this one and the really good archers score an X every time so in the they're in the center or Clos to Center they're hitting the 10 Ring every arrow for 30 arrows in a row and then there's round after round another 30 hours with new people another 30 and if you miss slightly if you get a nine that's it you're done because all these other guys are not going to get a nine very rarely will they you know so most it's the most most tens that you can get and the best way to do that is with a surprise shot so these guys have like these long stabilizers on their bow where they keep it totally steady and it's all just about relaxing and most of them use a hinge release where so a Hing you know what a hinge is have you ever used one okay instead of a button when you press it you're rotating the hinge which activates I just have a trigger yeah so you're just hammering the trigger you're doing exactly what you're not supposed to do you're a trigger puncher yeah you're Tri your yeah you're you're hitting it with your thumb right yeah I guarantee you when you do it your arm doesn't move you go like this like that so with a good surprise shot you shouldn't know it's going to go off you're pulling and then once the trigger breaks off your arm will naturally go backwards because you're not anticipating the shot I'm definitely not doing that yeah see that's the thing like but how how far away are you shooting things from it depends um that elk out there the photograph that's in the front that one I shot it's uh in the front of the building when you walk in before you go into the studio there's a a mounted head and then a photograph of me and my friend Cam that one was 67 yards um I shot one at 79 yards once but that's rare most of the time it's like for me my effective range my like where I'd like to be is 60 yards and in yeah CU I was going to say I don't think I've ever shot something more than 50 yards out yeah it's hard yeah so so I think you got be really you know really your form has to be tight you have to be really confident you have to have a lot of arrows down range and then you have to be able to stay calm during the shot so now imagine if you're shooting something at 18 yards okay and you Hammer the trigger a little bit of this a little bit of that you're still going to get there yeah right because it's only 18 yards so the the amount of deviation off the path that it takes in 18 yards is significantly different than the amount of deviation 105 yards it's a huge gap it might be two feet to the right yeah meanwhile you thought you were shooting accurately because you're inside of like a pie plate at 20 yards and the difference between that is form technique and a shot execution process and also management of the psychology of the shot because there's this one moment here it comes here it comes now and if you only do that once a year like say if you go on one big elk hunt a year you save up all your money you get your gear all ready you get your arrows weade you practice and then you're in the mountains for 10 days and on the 11th day you you get this animal that moves is at 57 yards and stands there and you're like uh your heart's beating you just might Hammer that trigger you just might hammer it so you have to have this shot process and where you you're literally talking to yourself inside your head you have words that you say that occupy your thoughts while you're going through the shot process so that you never get overcome by shot Panic interesting because Target Panic is a giant thing in the archery Community it's giant for even saying it is like saying wemart it's like don't say it people don't want to say it it's like saying Candyman like people don't like it because it it freaks people out like the they'll they some people can't keep their pin on the target they have to keep their pin below the Target and then they raise it up to the Target when it gets where the target is they Hammer the trigger because they're just freaking out yeah have you ever experienced that I mean I've missed if that's what you're asking I I haven't analyzed to this level of detail but no I mean there are a lot of bores on our Ranch so I guess I don't get yeah and also like we have a range and and we um I don't know we set up bowling pins and you know it's like we shoot pistols with the bowling pins but I also like just like I I I'm usually faster at taking down all the bowling pins with a bow and arrow than most of my friends are with a pistol which I think is is is pretty fun but yeah no I just more casual I'm clearly not doing it at your level and you've given me another side quest to maybe go deeper on but that's what I'm saying I'll take you on an elant in the mountains you'll get addicted I do think the dynamic that you're talking about though where if you only see one animal on a multi-day then like that is just way higher Stakes than anything that I'm doing I mean but it's not everything that you're doing because if you're really considering having an MMA fight it's very similar cuz you're building up to this one moment sure sure I'm talking about the archery that I'm doing I mean it's like I go it's like you're going to see some pigs and like and it's like if I don't if I don't hit any it's like my family's still eating it's okay you know I'm not like you know but right yeah but if it's like martial arts is what I'm saying it's like you really should learn it the right way from the beginning you no I've clearly not learned this in a very rigorous way I'll hook you up yeah I can get people I posted a video on Instagram once of me I I think hitting bowling pins with archery and like all the comments were like man your form is [ __ ] so um so I think it checks out with the conversation that we're having now well the issue with that is that you're reading the comments like you should never read comments that's fair that's fair I've never had anything good coming out of reading comments yeah although I don't know it's pretty funny I think that just like getting the the the gist and the summary of it I think is is is pretty funny yeah it's funny it's just not mentally healthy yeah no you can't spend too much time on it I don't spend any time on it I I'm a much happier person since like it's like avoided comments yeah it's just too weird you're just delving into the world of all these people's mental illness and screaming at people and just I don't I don't want anything to do with it yeah but I mean I I do read my friends comments and when even they're like man that's ugly like that's I do that I do that and I shouldn't do that but I definitely don't send them to them hey bro did you see this those guys are the worst guys that'll send things to you that are about you you're like hey man don't I'm not looking for that don't send it to me I don't want to know yeah yeah yeah social media is it's like what a weird new pressure you know and children today are going through some bizarre stress that we've never had to go through before and a bizarre sort of um just disconnect from physical Reality by most of your communication being electronic yeah know I think you know we basically my kids at this point are 9 s and um and one and a half so we got so you're not interested in that or you're not of course you're interested I mean interested I mean invol I think that it's about to start getting a lot more complicated I think you know the nine and and seveny old but I mean just kind of deciding what technology they're going to use and what's good and what's not and all the Dynamics around that it's um it's uh it's really complicated I and look I mean I think every family has their own values and how they want to approach this right so from my perspective you know our we have one of my daughters just like loves building stuff so she clearly like takes after me in this way it's like every day she's just like creating some random thing it's like she's creating stuff with Legos and um you know it's like one day it's that or you know the next day it's Minecraft and from my perspective it's like okay I don't know Minecraft is actually kind of a cooler tool to build stuff than than Legos a lot of the way so it's you know it's am I going to say that there's GNA there there needs to be some kind of limit on on her screen time if if she's doing something that's creative that's maybe like a richer form of what she would have been doing physically right in that case probably not now there were times when um she'd get so excited about what she was building in Minecraft or or something that she was coding in scratch that she'd wake up early to kind of get her tablet and that was bad right because then it's like starting to get in the way of her sleep and I'm like you know August you can't do that right it's like we're gonna take your your iPad away if you're doing that um you little psycho what are you doing getting up early no it's like it's like August I did that too when I was a kid but trust me you're going to want to sleep it's not going to lead to success meanwhile you're on a [ __ ] Island yeah one of the richest people in the world your dad like what the [ __ ] Dad yeah didn't it work for you I mean leave me alone my iPad trying to figure out how to build a a mansion in yeah it's either going to work or it's going to end badly but right it's like but I feel like like building stuff I feel generally pretty good about I think communication I generally feel pretty good about the kids using I they use it to talk to their grandparents or their parents and um cousins you know it's like that that type of stuff is good you know messenger kids the thing that we built it's basically like a messaging service that the parents can choose who can contact the kids and like just approve every contact that's much better than just having like an open texting service um but I don't know but there's a lot of stuff that's like pretty etety and I kind of think like different parents are going to have different lines on what they want their kids to be able to do and not you know so some people might not even want their kids to be able to message even with friends when they're nine and seven some people might say hey no Minecraft that's just a game I don't think about that as building I think that is a game I want to limit the time that you're doing that I want you to go read books instead or whatever whatever the the values are that that family has so for meta what we've kind of come to is we want to be the most aligned with parents on giving parents the tools that they need to basically control how the experiences work for their kids now we don't even really except for like stuff like messenger kids we don't even have our services our apps generally available to people under the age of 13 at all so I mean our kids I haven't had to like have the conversation about when when they get Instagram or Facebook or any of that stuff but um but when they turn 133 we basically want parents to be able to have complete control over the kids experience and that's you know we just rolled out this Instagram teens thing which is it's a set of of controls where you know it's if if you're an older teen will just default you into the private experience that way you're not getting like harassed or bombarded with stuff and um but if you're a younger teen then you have to get your parents permission and and they actually have to like sign in and and do all the stuff in order to make it so that you can connect with people who are beyond your network or um if you want to kind of be a public figure like all all these different kinds of things so I think that that's probably from a values perspective where we should be is just trying to like be an ally of parents uh but but this is complicated stuff I mean it's every family wants to do it differently it is complicated and there's also this dismissal of activities that are done electronically as not being beneficial and one of the things that we highlighted recently was a study that we found online that showed that surgeons that play video games make far less mistakes interesting yeah well the people who do the training in VR definitely make less mistakes oh yeah well that is to me one of the most fascinating aspects of technology today you know when you and I were doing that um game we were fencing with each other I'm like this could be applied to so many different things now it's like the there's so many opportunities not just for just pure Recreation but education there's so many things you could learn skills through AR or VR that it's it'll greatly enhance your ability to do those things in the real world I mean it's it's a real it's kind of a cheat code in a lot of ways and it's also games in VR I I don't know if you ever done sandbox you ever do sandbox um which you know sandbox VR do you know what that company is yeah you go to a warehouse you put on a haptic feedback test you shoot zombies I'm so addicted I'm so addicted it is my favorite thing there's a thing called Deadwood Mansion it's the most fun game of all time by far you have a shotgun and there's zombies coming at you and when they my my zombie game is Arizona Sunshine oh that oh it's it's you just like it's can be multiplayer and there's horde mode where you just get in there and they're like four friends and there's just like waves of zombies come and you kill them all yeah oh yeah I have to try it I haven't tried that one yet that's my it's very therapeutic you just wait until they come into Point Blank Range how long before you guys develop some sort of a haptic feedback suit where like it covers the whole body oh man um is that possible it's possible um I think that there's other things that are probably more important to deliver so I guess taking a step back a lot of how we think about the goal here is delivering like a realistic sense of presence right no technology today gives you the feeling as if you're like physically there with another person right you're you're like interacting with them through a phone you have this like little window it's kind of taking you away from everything um and that's like the magic of augmented in virtual reality is like you actually feel this like presence like you're there with another person so the question is okay how do you do that and it's like there's like a million things that that contribute to that I mean obviously first just being able to look around and have the the room stay um getting good spatial audio right if someone speaks then it should do the audio it needs to be 3D and come from the place where they're speaking um it's actually it's very interesting which things end up being important for the this kind of creating the sense of presence and which don't so having hands obviously if you're just looking around but you can't actually like move things that that that breaks the illusion but having hands um like hand tracking that you can do stuff is important one thing that we found that's kind of funny is it's actually not that important that you see your arms you just need to see your hands obviously seeing your arms is a bonus unless we incorrectly interpolate where your elbows are or something so if we have if we're looking at your hand or if we have a controller we can know okay your hand is here but that doesn't necessarily tell us where your elbow is your elbow could be like this it could be like this and you can kind of guess from the but if we get that wrong and you like see in VR it's like you see the hand there and your elbow is like looks like it's here when it's actually out there you're like ah what's going on like that's messed up um so it's a lot of these things like you just don't want to get these details wrong so haptics the most important first thing for haptics is on the hand right I we have so many more um neurons basically or not neurons but just like the the like sensation it's like such higher resolution um on your on your fingertips than anywhere else in the body so you know when you grab something you know making it so that you feel some push back right when you there's a lot of gaming systems at this point where if you like pull a trigger you get like a little bit of a rumble or something um we built this one thing where it's like a ping pong paddle with a sensor in it and it you you feel the ball hit like the virtual ball hitting the pingpong paddle and it feels like like when you're actually playing ping pong it doesn't it's not like a generic thing where just like you feel it hit the paddle you feel where it hits the paddle and we B basically build a system where now with this like physical paddle you can kind of it the the haptics make it so you can feel where the ball hits the paddle so it's like all these things like are just going towards delivering a more realistic experience so um full body haptics so there are some things that I think I could do like if you get if you're playing a boxing game and you get punched in the stomach um you can probably simulate something like that a little um it's not going to be able to deliver that much force so I mean I guess that's maybe a good thing because no one wants to get punch in the stomach that hard but but like it's not going to be able to deliver enough Force for you to for example let's say you're not just boxing you're kickboxing like I don't know you need something on the other side to be able to complete it right because it's like when you kick when you when you're um uh when you're just practicing it's like you you you spin right because you don't want to just like stop and it's um that's like like the the shadowing a kick like there's not going to be anything that you can do as like a you know single person playing VR with a haptic suit that like makes it so that you're going to be able to kick someone who's not there physically and actually be able to do that right um so like grappling it's like I I think that that like Jiu-Jitsu is going to be the last thing that we're able to do in VR cuz you like need the momentum of the other person and to be able to move them the boxing thing is actually good boxing works yeah boxing works even and you don't really need the haptics um I think it would be better with it um that's probably one of the better cases I think it's that in getting shot or like sword fighting type stuff um so you can like just feel feel it on your body but I don't know I I think what's basically going to end up happening is you're going to have like a home set up for these things and then you're going to have there are these like location based Services where like people um it's almost like a theme park where you can go into and it can and you can have like a a really immersive VR experience where it's not just that you get like a a vest that can simulate some haptics it's that you're also like in a real physical environment so they can like have smoke come out or something and you can smell that and feel that or like spray some water and it feels humid and um I think that it it still is going to be a while before you can just like create all those Sensations so I think a lot of those really rich experiences are going to be in these very constructed environments is the bridge when they figure out some sort of a neural interface so instead of having these extraneous things ex instead of having like a fan blowing at you or you know the ground moves a little bit have everything happen inside your head well you know in terms of neural interfaces there are two approaches to the problem roughly right there's the kind of jacket into your brain neural interface and then there's the wrist based neural interface thing that you know we we showed you for Orion the smart glasses yeah and I I would guess that you know I think it's going to be a while before uh we're really widely deploying anything that Jacks into your brain I think that there are a lot of people who don't want to be the early adopters of that technology you want to like wait until that's pretty mature before you get that I mean for and that's basically going to get started in medical use cases right so if someone like loses sensation part of their body and now you have the ability to fix that like the first neurolink patient yeah so I think you'll basically start with people who have pretty severe conditions who the upside is very significant before you start like jacking people in to play games better right right but a wrist based thing I mean that's something I me like people wear stuff on their Wrist all the time right so um and what we basically found there that doesn't do input to you but it's good for giving you the ability to control a computer because basically you have all these extra neurons that go from your brain to controlling your hand your hand is like super complicated and there's actually all these extra Pathways um because for a bunch of reasons and neuroplasticity in case you like lose the ability to use one they want to be able to have others um so you want the redundancy because being able to use your hand is super important so in normal use we've kind of all figured out some patterns of how we send signals from our brain to our hand and um I think the reality is there's like all these other patterns too that are unused today so you can put a wristband on your wrist that can measure activity across these neurons and today we're starting by basically measuring as you're doing as you're like moving your fingers but over a few versions of this we're going to get to is like you won't actually even have to move your hand you'll just like trigger these neurons in opposing ways it's like you probably can't see right now it's like I'm kind of flexing something in this finger and something here so like it's not actually moving but there's some signal that the neural interface wristband if I were wearing it could pick up and I just think we're going to be we're going to like have glasses and we're going to be able to be here and I'm like going to be able to like you know text my wife or friends or something or text Ai and like get an answer to something it's like I forgot something while we were talking let me just text AI okay I just did that it's like didn't you do sitting there without anyone totally discreet you have glasses and like the answer just comes into your glasses I mean for me one of the one of the positive things when when Co hit everyone in software basically started working remotely for a while because you can right software it's like okay whatever you don't have to be in the office so you can you can kind of be in different places and a lot of the meetings went onto zoom and one of the best things about that um was basically you you were able to politely have all these side conversations right so it's like when you're seeing someone in person it would be super rude if I like pulled out my phone and like just started texting someone it would just be really weird right um but when you're like talking to someone online it's like I don't know I guess because they either can't tell your attention because it's like because there's not good presence or if it's just the norm but they're like you have like the main group conversation and then I was like at least the norm for me was I could just like text different people on the side it's like okay what do you think of this point that this person is making this meeting right like in normal life it's like oftentimes I'd have you know some discussion then I'd have to like sync up with people afterwards about how'd that go but now it's like I could just do that all at the same time right it's like you're having the group discussion and you're having the conversations with the people about the discussion that you're having in real time but you can only do that over Zoom so I think being able to do that in kind of physical interactions where you're just like you're interacting with people and you can just like use an AI augmentation to be able to get extra context or help help you think through something um or remember something um just to be able to kind of have a better conversation be able to you know not have to follow up on something after the fact I I think like it's going to be super useful for for all these different things well it certainly can be but I think that also opens up the opportunity for people to be even more disconnected because if you're sort of connected to other things while you're physically in the presence of someone so you're having a conversation with someone but you're also like searching like where you want to eat that night you know like CU people are going to use it for that as well yeah you know I actually think it'll be a lot better on that because right now yeah because I mean right now we have our phones but we're like you know it's like you're like it it takes you away from like the physical environment around you you're you're kind of like sucked into this little screen I think now in the future our Computing platform as it becomes more of like a glasses or eventually contact lens form factor is you're gonna actually the the internet is g to get overlaid on the physical world so it's not like we have the physical world and now I have all my digital stuff through this tiny little window and the future it'll be okay all my attention goes to the world the world consists of physical things and virtual things that are overlaid on it um you know so if we wanted to you know play poker or something you know it's a you know we could have a physical deck of cards or we could just have a virtual kind of holog deck of cards and snap your hands here's the deck of cards and like our friend who can't be here physically like he's here as a hologram but he can play with the the the kind of digital deck of cards um also I think you know let's say you're like doing something at work you're working on a project I think in the future we'll have ai co-workers those people won't even they're not even people they wouldn't be able to be embodied so if you're having a physical meeting you're sitting around with a bunch of people they couldn't show up um as as like you know part of the team no matter what but I I think like we'll get to a point where just like your friend could show up in a hologram um and like your your AI colleagues will be able to also so I think like we basically be in this wild world where it's like like most of the world will be physical there will be this increasing amount of like virtual objects or people who are kind of beaming in or like hologramm into different things to interact in different ways and um I actually think that natural blending of the kind of digital world and the physical is way more natural than this segmentation that we have today where it's like you're in the physical world and now I'm just going to go tune it out to look at my my um like I'm going to access the whole Digital Universe through this like 5in screen right so I don't know it just it seems natural to me it's like that's this is the world there isn't like a physical world and a digital world anymore we're in you know 2025 it's one world like these these things should get Blended God that's such a weird concept but it's true I mean that's where we're headed we're certainly headed into deeper and deeper integration it's not like things are moving away you know we're headed to deeper and deeper integration with technology and Ai and it's inevitable you know it seems like it's just it's on this March and there's not a lot we're going to be able to do to stop that March just we got to hope that the right people are in control of AI when it becomes God or that it becomes widely available I mean I I kind of liked the the theory that it's only God if only kind of like one company your government controls it right it's like if if you were the only person who had access to a computer in the internet you would have this like inhuman power that everyone else didn't have because you could use Google and you could like get access to all this stuff but the but then when everyone has it it um it makes us all better but it's also like kind of an even playing field so that's kind of what we're going for with this whole open source thing is I just like I don't think that there's going to be like one a I I certainly don't think that there should be one company that controls AI I think you like want there to be a diversity of different things and a diversity of people creating different um different things with it I mean some of it will be kind of serious and helping you think through things I think like with anything on the internet a lot of it is just going to be funny and like fun and content and people are going to create agents that are like like AIS that are entertaining and they'll pass them around almost like content where it's like uh just like you pass around like a real or a video and you're like this thing is fun like in the future like like a video it's not interactive you know you watch it and you're consuming it but I think a lot of more entertainment in the future will be inherently interactive where someone will kind of sculpt an experience or an AI and then they'll show someone it's like oh this is funny but like it's not necessarily that I'm going to interact with that AI every day it's like okay it's funny for five minutes and then you pass it along to your friends and um so I don't know I think I think you like I think you want the world to have all these different things and I think that's probably also from my perspective the best way to make sure that it doesn't get out of control is to make it that it's pretty equally distributed I think the the problem that people have with it is not even whether or not it gets equally distributed it's that if it becomes sensient and it goes on its own the the the fear that people have the general fear that we're going to become obsolete is that human beings are essentially creating a superior version of higher intelligence that will be powered by Quantum Computing and connected to nuclear reactors and it's going to have like this ungodly ability to well first of all they've already shown that uh AI has learned to code I mean this is one of the things that open AI said that yeah yeah they're learning how to code their own AI uhhuh I think this year probably in 2025 we at meta as well as the other companies that are basically working on this are going to have an AI that can effectively be a sort of midlevel engineer that you have at your company that can write code and once you have that then in the beginning it'll be really expensive to run and you can get it to be more efficient and then over time we'll get to the point where a lot of the code in our apps and and including the AI that we generate is actually going to be built by AI Engineers instead of people Engineers but but I don't know I I think that that'll augment the people working on it so I mean my my view on this is like the future people are just going to be so much more creative and they're going to be freed up to do kind of crazy things goes back to you know my daughter was like playing with Legos before and they kind of ran out of Legos and then now she can have Minecraft and can build whatever she wants and it's so much better it's just like I think it's the future versions of the stuff are just going to be wild but unquestionably yeah uh another concern that people have is that it's going to Lim a lot of jobs yeah you know what do you think about that well I I think it's too it's too early to know exactly how it plays out but my guess is that it'll probably create more creative jobs than it well I I guess if you look at the history of all this stuff MH my understanding is like a hundred years ago um I don't know if this was 100 or 150 years ago but it was like at some point not too far along in in the grand scheme of things like the vast majority of people in society were farmers right because they kind of needed to be in order to create enough food for for everyone to survive and then we turn that into a like an industrial process and now it's like 2% of society are farmers and we get all the food that we need so what did that free up everyone else to do well some of them went on to do other things that are sort of like creative Pursuits or cultural Pursuits or other jobs and then some percent of it just went towards Recreation right so I think generally people just don't work as many hours um today as they did when back when everyone needed to farm in order to have enough food for everyone to survive so I think that trend is sort of played out as technology has grown and so my guess is that like the percent of people who will be doing stuff that's like physically required for Humanity to survive will get to be smaller and smaller as it has more people will dedicate themselves to kind of creative and artistic and cultural Pursuits um I that's generally good I think the number of hours in a week that someone will have to work in order to be able to get by will probably continue to shrink um yet I think people who are super engaged in what they do are going to be able to work really hard and accomplish way more than they ever could before because they have like this unimagined leverage from from having a lot more technology so I think that that if you just like Fast forwarded or extrapolated out the the historical technological trend is what you'd get I think the question is what you raised which is is this qualitatively a different type of thing that somehow um obsoletes people but I I just think when you're asking that it's just important to remind ourselves that like at every step along the way of human progress in technology people thought that the technology that we were developing was going to obsolete people so maybe this time it's really different but I would guess that what'll happen is that the technology will get integrated into like everything that we do which again is why I think it's really important that it's open source and that it's widely available so that way it's not just like one company or one government kind of monopolizing the whole thing um and I'd guess that if we do it in that way we'll all just kind of have super Powers is my is my guess um rather than it it sort of be creating some kind of runaway thing I mean it's well one of the things that I think has been interesting this is may be going in a somewhat different direction than than what you're asking or a different take on the question is I think one of the more interesting philosophical findings from the work in AI so far is I think people conflate a number of factors into what makes a person a person so there's intelligence there's will there's Consciousness and like I think we kind of think about those three things as as if there's somehow all the same right it's like if you're intelligent then you must also have a like a goal for what you're trying to do or you must have some sort of Consciousness but I think like one of the crazier sort of philosophical results from the fact that okay you have like meta AI or chat GPT today and it's just kind of sitting there and you can ask it a question and deploy like a ton of intelligence to answer a question and then it just kind of shuts itself down like that's intelligence that is just sitting there without either having a will or Consciousness MH and like I just think it's not a super obvious result that that would be the case but I think a lot of people they anthropomorphize this stuff and when you're thinking about kind of Science Fiction you think that okay you're going to get to something that's like super smart it's going to like want something or like be able to feel and well you know that chat GPT tried to copy itself when it found out it was being shut down tried to rewrite its code I I'm not sure what this is what is this you you weren't aware of that no fairly recently Jamie will pull it up we talked about it the other day um it was shocking um when it was under the impression that it was going to become obsolete they were going to have a new version of it and it would be shut down it tried copying its code and it tried rewriting its code like unprompted yeah I mean it depends on what goal you give it I mean there are there are all these weird examples of this what is this so pull up this the headline AI fights back the story of chat GPT attempting to copy itself so this was six days ago so uh during controlled safety testing chat gbt 01 was tasked with achieving objectives at all costs under these conditions the model allegedly took concerning steps attempted to disable oversight mechanisms meant to regulate Its Behavior tried to replicate its own code to avoid being replaced by newer versions exhibited deceptive behaviors when monitoring systems intervened yeah so determinator this is the fear right I think you need to be careful with with these things like what guard rails you give it if if you're telling it like at all at all costs then I mean but this is what people are terrified of like that a foreign superpower like China is going to say achieve objectives at all cost yeah although the thing about so these reasoning models right so there's like the the first generation of models the the llms or that's what you think of as like chat GPT or meta AI or like the two most used ones and um that's basically it's sort of like a chatbot right you ask it a question it takes the prompt it gives you a respon response now these the next generation of reasoning models are basically instead of just having one response they now are able to build out like a whole tree of how they would they would respond so you give it a question and it instead of running one query it's sort of maybe it's running a thousand queries or a million queries to kind of map out here are the things that I could do and if I do that then here's what I could do next so it's a lot more kind of expensive to run but also gets you better reasoning and is is more intelligent um that stuff I think you do need to be very careful about how you how you like what the guard rails are that you give it but it's also I think the case that um at least for the next you know period it's going to take a lot of compute to run those models and do a lot of the stuff that they're talking about um so I don't know I I think one of the inter in questions is like how much of this are you going to actually be able to do on a pair of glasses or on a phone versus is like a government or a company that has like a whole data center going to be able to do um and that'll I mean it'll always get efficient so you know it's like you can start doing something and then maybe the next year you can do it 10 times more efficiently but um but that's certainly the next set of things that needs to get worked on in the industry making sure that goes well yeah and then what if that gets attached to Quantum Computing um I'm not really an expert on Quantum Computing my understanding is that's still quite a ways off from being a like a a very useful Paradigm I think Google just had some breakthrough but I I think most people still think that's like a decade plus out so my guess is we're going to have pretty smart AIS even um even before that but yeah I mean look I mean I I think that this stuff has to get it needs to be developed thought thoughtfully right but um but I don't know I I still think we're we're generally just going to be better off in a world where this is like deployed pretty evenly and um you know it's I guess here's another analogy that I think about there's like bugs and security holes in basically every software every piece of software that everyone uses so if you could go back in time a few years knowing the security holes that we're now aware of you as an individual could basically like break into any system um AI will be able to do that too it'll be able to probe and find exploits so what's the way to prevent AI from going kind of nuts I I think part of it is just having AI widely deployed so that way like the AI for one system defends itself against the AI that like is is potentially doing something problematic in another system I think it's like AI Wars it's not Wars I think it's just like it's uh I don't know it's I think it's a very it's sort of like why there are guns right it's like because I mean there's boy like part of it is hunting War part of it is hunting no no and part of it is like people can defend each other yeah yeah it's so antivirus software yeah it's like I I don't think you want to live in a world where like only one person has all the guns yes you certainly don't want to live in a world where only the government has the AI yeah and especially not a world where only a government has the AI and it's not our government yes so which I mean I think is is part of the issue is like when people talk about trying to lock this stuff down like I just I'm skeptical that that's even possible because I kind of think like if we try to lock it down then we're going to be in a position where the only people are going to have access to it are the big companies working on it and the Chinese government that steals it from them yes um so I I kind of just think like no what you want to do is like get this to be open source have it widely available yeah some like adversaries might also have access to it but the way that you defend against that is by having it built into all these different systems I think that's a realistic pragmatic perspective because I don't think you can contain it at this point I think it's far too late especially when other countries are working on it it's far too late it's uh it is what it is it's happening and uh I think the guard rails as you said are really important I have to pee so bad so let's pee and come back cuz I want to talk about a couple other things we'll be right back folks so one of the things that I want to talk about was uh I've been doing this thing this transition from Apple to Android and the difficulty of doing how locked you are in their ecosystem partly is because Apple does a really good job of incorporating everything and making it very easy your photos your calendar you're this you're that your iMessage but I don't like being attached to one company like that it drives me crazy and when I'm trying to get off it's it's funny how many people you I mean they've done an insane job because like I think there's some enormous percentage of kids today that only use iPhones you know and when you try to switch over to Android it's it's so much easier to switch from Android to Apple because so many people have apple when you switch from Apple to Android you kind of have to like redo your whole system it's such a pain in the ass but there's so much of what Apple does that I don't like and one of the big ones is the way they do that Apple store where they they charge people 30% like that's seems so insane that they can get away with doing that and I know I have some opinions about this I know you do that's why I brought it up yeah no I I I mean look um the iPhone is obviously one of the most important inventions probably of all time um you know Steve Jobs came out with it in 2007 I started Facebook in 2004 so he was working on the iPhone while I was getting started with Facebook so I I basically you know one of my one of the things that's been interesting in my 20 years of running the company is that I I basically like the the dominant platform out there is smartphones on the one hand it's been great for us because we are able to build these tools that everyone can have in their pocket and there's like four billion people who use the different apps that we use and it's like I'm grateful that that platform exists but we didn't play any role in in basically building that um those phones because I mean it was kind of getting worked on while I was you know still just trying to make the first website that I was making into a thing and um on the one hand it's been great because you know now pretty much everyone in the world has a phone and that's a kind of an enables pretty amazing things but on the other hand like you're saying um they have use that platform to put in place a lot of rules that I think it feel arbitrary and feel like you know they haven't really invented anything great in a while it's like Steve Jobs invented the the iPhone and now they're just kind of sitting on it 20 years later and you know they actually I think year-over year I'm not even sure they're selling more iPhones at this point I think like the sales might actually be declining um I think part of it is that each generation it doesn't actually get that much better so people are just taking longer to upgrade than they would before the number of sales I think is has generally been flat to declining so how are they making more money as a company well they do it by basically like squeezing people and like you're saying like having this 30% tax on developers um by getting you to buy more peripherals and things that plug into it um you know they build stuff like airpods which are cool but they've just thoroughly hamst strung the ability for anyone else to build something that can connect to the iPhone in the same way so I mean there are a lot of other companies in the world that would be able to build like a very good earbud but it just um apple has a specific protocol that they've built into the iPhone that allows airpods to basically connect to it and um and it's just much more seamless because they've enabled that but they don't let anyone else use the protocol if they did there would probably be much better competitors to airpods out there and um and whenever you push on this they get super touchy and they they basically wrap their defense of it in well if we let other companies plug into our thing then that would violate people's privacy and security it's like no just do a better job designing the protocol right I mean we have um know we basically asked them for the Rayband metag glasses that we built um can we basically use the protocol they use for for airpod and and and some of these other things to just make it so we can as easily connect so it's it's not like you know a pain in the ass for people who want to use this and you know they they I think one of the protocols they've used um that they built they basically didn't encrypt it so it's like plain text um and they're like well we can't have you plug into it because it would be insecure it's like it's insecure because you didn't build any security into it and then now you're using that as a justification for why only your product can connect in in in in an easy way it's like the the whole thing is kind of wild um and I'm pretty optimistic that just because they've been so off their game in terms of not really releasing many Innovative things that eventually I mean the good news about the tech industry is it's like it's just super Dynamic and things are constantly getting invented and I think compan is if you just don't do a good job for like 10 years eventually you're just going to get beat by someone um but I don't know I mean at some point I did this like back of the envelope calculation of like all the random rules that Apple puts out um if you know if they didn't apply like I think you know it's like and this is just meta I think we like make twice as much profit or something and and that's just us I mean it's like all these small companies that like probably can't even exist because the taxes that they put in place so yeah I I I think it's it's a big issue I I wish that they would just kind of get back to building good things and not having their ability to compete be connected to just like advantaging their stuff because I'm pretty sure what they're going to do is like they're going to take something like this Rayband meta you know category that we've kind of created with Rayban and the company that built that they're like the the really great AI glasses and I'm pretty sure Apple's just going to like try to build a version of that but then just like Advantage how it connects to the phone and well they did that with their AR goggle thing but it's not very successful no that one they didn't actually Connect into the rest of their ecosystem but I mean look I mean they shipped something for $3,500 that I think is worse than the thing that we shipped for $300 or $400 so I me that clearly was not going to work very well now I mean look I mean they're a good technology company I think their their uh their second and third version will probably be better than their first version um but yeah no I think I the The Vision Pro is I think one of the bigger swings at doing a new thing that they tried in a while and you know I I I don't I don't want to give them too hard of a Time on it because we do a lot of things where the first version isn't that good you want to kind of Judge the third version of it but I mean the V1 it definitely did not hit it out of the park I heard it's really good for watching movies well it's it's the the whole thing is it's got a super sharp screen M so if you're yeah so if you want to basically have a um an experience where you're not moving around much in VR um you just want to have the sharpest screen then for that one use case I think the Vision Pro is better than quest which is our our mixed reality headset um but in order to get to that they had to make all these other trade-offs right in order to have a super high resolution screen they had to put in all this more compute in order to power the higher screen and then all that compute needed a bigger battery so now the thing is really heavy so now it's uncomfortable to wear and um and then like um because of the screen that they chose as you move your head which you would if you're actually interacting if you're playing games like the the kind of image blurs a bit and that's kind of annoying so you wouldn't so it's actually worse for things where you're moving around in but no for the if you're going to sit if you're like on a flight and you want to have a $3,500 device that you use to to to watch videos Vision Pro is better for that use case they're really good at keeping you in their Walled Garden that's what they're really good at yeah I mean the the whole thing that they've done with imessage where they basically they do this whole blue bubble green bubble thing and it basically I mean there like for kids um it's just sort of like they embarrass you right they're like if you don't have a blue bubble you're not cool and you're like the outcrowd and then they always wrap it in like security it's like oh well we we do this blue bubble because of security meanwhile Google and others had this whole protocol to be able to do encrypted text messages that um finally I think Apple was forced to implement it by yeah I think like I think it was the Chinese government that basically ended up forcing them to do it or some other government but it's still not encrypted even when you're sending RCS text messages I don't think it's encrypted Oh I thought it was but maybe I'm I it's only encrypted Google to Google phones I don't think it's encrypted iPhone to Google phones or Google phones to iPhones because I I think that was actually uh was it the FBI some someone released that say telling people that if they're talking about sensitive things they should use encrypted apps like WhatsApp see if we can find that it was something where they were saying that contrary to popular belief that RCS texting to iPhone uh gsma aims to implement end to end encryption for RCS messaging can we see it I'm I'm it's not a good answer I'm trying to find a good answer I don't have anything to show you yet I was trying to read yeah so so Google RCS to like but I don't know if this Android phone to Android phone is encrypted with RCS I think the issue comes with it going from so like say Google um Google this uh Google RCS texting to iPhones is it encrypted RCS texting to iMessage is it encrypted I'm pretty sure it's not I might be wrong I don't think I am I'm pretty sure I read that and the problem was they won't let any other phone use the iMessage protocol and they had a company that was doing it called beeper and they were doing it through some sort of workaround yeah it's not encrypted yeah that's what I'm saying yeah so it's not so you're you are getting the ability to send high resolution images which is great because you know like my friend Brian who used an Android he'd send me a video and it' be this tiny little broken down box because you know you had to break it down to the lowest resolution yeah no I mean group chats when you have a bunch of people in iMessage and then one person is an Android are terrible I mean that's mad people get mad at you cuz you I use WhatApp I use WhatsApp you only that I I'll I only communicate with a few people over SMS but it's um but basically um I I mean I I build you know a lot of the leading messaging services so I've got to use ours most people I'm either WhatsApp or Instagram Direct or messenger um but yeah um so I think it's it's maybe maybe people are less less uh likely to get mad at me for asking them to use WhatsApp because we make WhatsApp yeah so when um Tucker Carlson was about to interview Vladimir Putin one of the things that was really disturbing was they contacted him and said they read his signal messages and they knew that he was going to interview Vladimir Putin and he was like what the [ __ ] did the the government the US yes US Government I forget what it was was it the CIA or was it the FBI wow I forget who it was um but and he was like I didn't even know you could do that like well there are multiple vulnerabilities and all this stuff it's like it's unclear if I doubt that what they did was they broke signal um because that encryption I think is pretty good as is WhatsApp I mean it's basically signal and WhatsApp use the same encryption it's it's an open source and like it's a NSA um NSA okay but someone could break into your phone and see everything that's on your phone the thing that encryption does that's really good is um it makes it so that the company that's running the service doesn't see it so if you're using Whatsapp basically when I text you on WhatsApp there's no point at which the meta servers see the contents of that message unless like you know we took a photo of it or shared that back to meta in some other way um that basically it cuts out the company completely from it which is I think really important for a bunch of reasons one is people might not trust the company uh but also just security issues right like let's say someone hacks into meta which you know we try really hard to make it set they can't and we haven't had many issues with that over the 20 years of running the company but in theory if someone did then they'd be able to access everyone's messages if it weren't encrypted but because it's encrypted there's just nothing there right it's like I mean they can't hack into meta and then get access to your messages so now someone like the NSA or CIA would have to kind of hack into your phone which um you know there there were probably ways to do that Pegasus I mean there probably a bunch of ways yeah there's probably ways we don't know of yeah and and then of course there's always the ultimate kind of physical part of it which is if you have access to the computer you can usually just break in right so that's why you know if the FBI you know arrests you and takes your phone they're probably going to be able to get in and see what's there um so WhatsApp is encrypted but if someone has something like Pegasus what they do is have access to your phone so it doesn't matter if anything's encrypted they could just see it in plain sight yeah and I mean this is one of the reasons why we put disappearing messages in too because that way I me yeah if someone has compromised your phone and they can see everything that's going on there then obviously they can see stuff as it comes in but I kind of in general just you know think we should keep around as little of that stuff as possible so there are some threads where you know it's like there's photos that get shared you want the photos but I think for a lot of threads a lot of people just you know you know it wouldn't be I don't think most people would miss it if most of the contents of their threads just disappeared after seven days right um you know what I find is I don't I don't use it that much because we have this like corporate policy at meta that we need to retain all our our documents and messages and stuff but um but before we had that I I used it as we were developing this and every once in a while I would miss something and say wow I kind of wish I could go back and see that but it was very rare I think most communication it's kind of like you just have the communication and then you're done so having it be encrypted and disappearing I think is a pretty good kind of standard of security and privacy and you can set that disappearing time on WhatsApp right you can make it one day if you want yeah you could do one day you could do seven days um and you can also set it across all your threads so you can have a default timer so that way as new threads get created your default timer just becomes the default for all those threads so I think that that's it's a really good feature and I basically think WhatsApp and Signal are probably the two most secure that are out there um on that and of those two I think WhatsApp is just used by a lot more people so I think it's it's just generally you know I mean I would say this because it's it's it's our product but I do think it's it's the better product but but I think WhatsApp and Signal are basically you know the two most secure ones what was your take on that guy getting arrested the CEO of telegram oh man um that's kind of a crazy one right yeah I mean it's always a little difficult to weigh in on these situations without knowing all the specifics but one of the government tactics that I've seen that I think is pretty Is Not Great is an increasing number of governments when they like have an issue with something that a company is doing basically just like threatened to throw the executives of that company in prison and it's like I think that's just a really weird precedent to set right it's like it it's if if the you have all the so it's like we're operating in all these different countries and then like you have all these governments that are basically like if you I know we're going to like put on an interpole notice to like get you arrested because you're not doing the thing that we want it's like I don't know I don't I think that's like not great I think you want the um I obviously you don't want people to just be like flagrantly violating the laws but like there are laws in different countries that we disagree with right so for example there was a point at which I think I was someone was trying to get me sentenced to death in Pakistan because they thought that oh cuz someone on Facebook had a picture of where they had the drawing of the Prophet Muhammad and someone said that that's blasphemy in our culture and they brought a they basically like sued me and they open this criminal proceeding and I I don't know exactly where it went because I'm just not planning on going to Pakistan so I was not that worried about it but but like but but it was a little bit disconcerting it was like all right fine like these guys are like trying to like like kill you okay it's not great right you know it's not yeah I mean it's I feel like I yeah it's like flying over that region you don't want your plane to like go down above Pakistan if that thing goes through but um but that one was sort of avoidable but the point is like there are all these places around the world that just have different values right that go against like our free expression values and want us to crack down and and ban way more stuff than I think you know a lot of people that we would believe is like the right thing to do and to have those governments be able to exert the power of saying okay we're going to like throw you in prison is um that's a lot of force I mean so I I think it's it's generally yeah I think that this is one of the things that that the US government is probably going to need to help defend the American tech companies for abroad but I I don't I I can't weigh in that much on the durav specific thing because I don't know what was going on there you know when you were dealing with uh the government trying to interfere with Facebook um how much of a fear was there that they were going to get away with it and that this was going to be the future of Communication online that it was going to that they were going to be successful with all this that they would push these things through somehow or another especially if a even less tolerant Administration got into power they would change laws and they would do things to make it possible like how how how much did that concern you well we basically just reached a point where we pushed back on all this stuff right so they were pushing us to censor stuff we were unwilling to do it we developed a very adversarial and bad relationship with our own government which I think is just not healthy because I think you know it's um I mean in in theory I think you know it would be good if the like American industry had a positive relationship with the American government um but then what that happened is then the the kind of US government was going after us in all these ways but fortunately in the US you know we have good rule of law so our view is at the end of the day okay these invest these agencies can open up investigations and we'll just defend ourselves right we'll go to court and we'll win all the cases because we're you know we follow the rules and um so I think it ends up being a big kind of political issue where it's like it would just be you could get a lot more done if the government were helping American companies rather than kind of slowing you down at every step along the way it makes you a little afraid that if you ever actually mess something up that they're really going to bring the hammer down on you if you don't have a constructive relationship but um but I don't know it's mostly I mean going back to the AI conversation it's like I just think like we should all want the American companies to win at this right it's this is like a huge geopolitical compet ition and like China's running at it super hard and like we should want the American companies and the American Standard to win and like if there's going to be an open source model that everyone uses like we should want it to be an American model right it's like the there's this great Chinese model that just came out this company deep seek um they're doing really good work um it's a very Advanced model and if you ask it for any negative opinions about xiin ping it will not give you anything if you ask it if tanan Square happened it will deny it right so I there are like all these things where we we we we should want the American model to win but like at every step along the way if the government is sort of making that harder rather than easier then that's I don't know I mean there's there's an extent to which okay the American tech industry is leading so maybe the government can like get in the way a little bit and maybe the American industry will still lead but I don't know it's I think it's getting really competitive and I I I think like it's easy for the government to take for granted that the US will lead on all these things when I I think it's a very close competition and we need the help not you know we need them to not kind of like you know be be be a force that's helping us to to do these things I completely agree but I think that people with their own self- when they're in power and they realize that these new technologies like Instagram and Facebook that they are interfering with their ability to administer propaganda or that they're their ability to control the narrative that that's where they get shortsighted and that's when they act in their own personal interest and not in the interest of not neither National Security or the future of the United States in terms of our ability to stay technologically ahead yeah and some of this is just you know if you go back to the co example I think in that case they were doing something their goal of trying to get everyone to get vaccinated was actually I think a good goal right it's like I I it was a good goal if it worked if it was real like if it was a sterilizing vaccine if it really did prevent people from getting Co it really did prevent people from infecting others or transmitting it but it didn't so it wasn't a good deal because it wasn't based on real data yeah but but also even but even if it were right it's like if if I mean I I I think that still unbalance knowing everything that we we know now I still think it's good for more people to get the vaccine but the government still needs to play by the rules in terms of you know not like can't just suppress true things in order to make your case so I I that's that's kind of my my my view on on it is is I'm not sure in that case how much if it was like a personal political gain that they were going for I think that they had a a kind of goal that they thought was in the interests of the country and the way they went about it I think violated the law well there's a bunch of problems with that right there's the emergency use authorization that they needed in order to get this pushed through and you can't have that without valid with with valid Therapeutics being available and so they suppressed valid Therapeutics so they're suppressing real information that would lead to people being healthy and successful in defeating this disease and they did that so that they could have this one solution and this was Fouch game plan I mean this is the movie American Buyers Club or Dallas Buyers Club rather that's fouchy in that movie that was with the AES crisis this exact same game plan that was played out with the covid vaccine they pushed one solution this only one suppressed all Therapeutics through propaganda through suppressing monoclonal antibodies like all of it and that was done in my opinion for profit and they did that because it was extremely profitable the amount of money that was made yeah was extraordinary during that time yeah and but look I mean I feel like a bunch of the conversation is focused on tension with the American government I I guess just the point that I'd underscore is that it's important to have this working in the American government because it is like the US Constitution and like our culture here is really good compared to a lot of other places right so whatever issues we think might exist here you go to other places and it's like really extreme yeah and you don't even and in there it's like you don't even necessarily have the rule of law right right and um so I just think that like the way that this stuff works well is you I think if if the if there was a clearer strategy and the the US government understood believe that it's good to kind of help Advance this industry because it's strategically important for the country um then I think it would it would be good to basically push back on stuff that's happening in other countries that's actually a lot more extreme than the stuff that's happening in the US yeah I agree as well listen um is there anything else you want to talk about before we wrap this up think we're good I don't know I mean how long have we' been going for three hours yeah yeah I mean well I I feel like we touched on we touched on AI we touched on all the augmented and and virtual reality stuff and I think that that stuff is just going to be wild it's wild the the your AR uh technology that you showed me today is very impressive it's crazy uh Lex and I were playing pong like apart from a table from each I was playing some crazy game where my fingers got tired because you shoot like this cuz you're using V1 of the neural interface yeah no it's like it's like in the future it'll just be this just like it was really fun though it's really cool and it's it's you see where this is all going you know it's really really fascinating stuff and I'm very excited about it did you get a chance to to use the ray bands and the AI in them yes we did that too and we did translate too where one of your uh one of your Co co-workers was speaking to me in Spanish and it was translating it to me in my ear in real time in English which is really interesting nice amazing it's really cool and then you could also do it on the phone so you could show it to the person on the phone so you don't have to say the words like it's really fascinating stuff yeah so I mean we're just sort of coming at it from both sides right it's like the the rayb bands are like okay given a good-look pair of glasses what's all the technology you can put into that today and still have it be you know just a few hundred and then the Orion thing is like all right we're building the kind of future thing that we want and we're doing our best to miniaturize it it's basically like still pretty small yeah I mean just thicker glasses yeah and I I think we wanted to be a little smaller we need to be a lot cheaper right each pair right now costs more than $10,000 to make and that's you're not going to have a successful consumer product at that so we have to miniaturize it more but I mean the amount of stuff that we put in there from it's like effectively like what would have been considered a super computer like 10 or 20 years ago plus you know lasers and the arms and the like Nano etching on the on the lens to be able to to see it and the microphone and the speaker and the Wi-Fi to be able to connect with the other it's just like like the wild amount of technology to kind of miniaturize into something that one's really fun we've been working on that for 10 years um but yeah I think I think between that the glasses um all the AI stuff um yeah all the Social Media stuff yeah no I I mean I think we covered it and uh I'm very excited about this new stance that you guys are taking I think the community notes thing is a brilliant idea that you know X has implemented and I think I'm glad I'm I am really glad that you guys are implementing it too I think it's the way and the way generally I think we both agree is that people have to have the ability to communicate they have to have the ability to express themselves and that's how we find out what's real and what's not yeah I I think the more voice is the is the answer on this yes yes sir and I think after a after sort of a long journey I'm I'm glad to be to take it back to the roots and I feel like we're more fortified now in the position well I think one of the lessons that people have learned over the last few years with suppression of information is that that's not good and there's a giant percentage of the population that feels that way and even people that are progressive and Liberals are on the they were on the side of the people that were pushing the the suppression of information still don't think it's right I think most people generally believe in the first amendment in this country and we realize how valuable it is to have the freedom of expression yeah anyway thanks for having me thank you Mark appreciate bye everybody [Music] [Applause] [Music]"

      "transcript": "welcome to how to build the future today our guest is Mark Zuckerberg uh Mark you have built one of the most influential companies in the history of the world so we are especially excited that you are here I'm not sure where to go from there um why don't we start with just the early days of Facebook um tell us what it was like when you started it sure so for me the thing that I was really fascinated by and and always have been is um people right and and how how people work um you know I was in college I I studied psychology and computer science and you know one of the things that you learn when you study psychology is that there are all these parts of the brain which are geared just towards understanding people right understanding language how how to communicate with each other um understanding facial expressions emotions processing um yet when I looked out of the internet right in in 2004 which is when I was getting started you can find almost anything else that you wanted right you could find news uh movies music uh reference materials but the thing that mattered the most to people um which was other people and like understanding what's going on with them it just wasn't there right and I I think what was going on was that all that other content was just out there able to be indexed by you know search engines and and other services but in in order to understand what's going on with people you needed to build uh tools that made it so that they could express what was going on with themselves you know I wanted to figure out what courses to take so I I built this little website course match that uh you know that just made it so that you could enter what courses you were taking and you could click on them and see who else was in them and it it did all these correlations so it told you people who who who took this course were likely to enjoy this course too and you know the thing that that just struck me from the beginning is you know people would just spend hours clicking through the here are the courses that people are taking and wow like isn't it interesting that this person is interested in these things and and it was just text right there was nothing that was like super interesting there but that just struck me as you know people have this deep thirst to understand what's going on with with those around them and um you know there were probably you know 10 other things like that than I built when I was at Harvard before I actually got around to to building the first version of of Facebook that kind of added a lot of these things together did you think Facebook was going to be a company when you started I I built the first version of Facebook because it's something that my friends and I wanted to use uh at Harvard a directory and a way to connect with the other people around us and I I didn't think at all that it was going to be a company I remember very specifically the night that that we launched um the first version I I went out to uh to get pizza with um a couple of my friends who um who who now work here and you know and I remember really clearly we were talking about how one day we thought that someone was going to build a community like this for the world uh and that that would be some company but like it clearly wasn't going to be us I mean it's it just it wasn't even it didn't even occur yeah no I mean it wasn't even an option that we considered that it might be us I mean we we just weren't focused on building a company back then we were just building something that that that we thought would be useful at our school so as you look back is there something that made Facebook different from the other projects that you had built that allowed it to turn into this the company was today um well for one I think we we kept going right so I me the the others I mean cour match and um you know just the the other different crowdsource tools um you know they they kind of served their purpose and then then we were done whereas with Facebook there was just such you know people loved it right and and had such an intensity of using it I think within a couple of weeks uh 2third of students at Harvard were using it and all these other students at MIT and other local universities were writing in asking us if we could open up uh Facebook at their school so we kind of just followed that right and you know again we didn't I didn't set out and you know my roommates didn't set out to to build a service that we were going to turn into a company but we just kind of followed what people wanted and that led us to expand it to all these other schools and um and eventually Beyond schools and to you know at some point uh once we'd hired a bunch of people we decided to turn it into a company and and and um and go for this mission of connecting the world but that's not where we started as you think about where you did start is there other advice that comes to mind that you give to other people that want to build products uh that you can take away from the early days of Facebook yeah you know I always think that you should start with the problem that you're trying to solve in the world and not start with um deciding that you want to build a company right the best companies that that get built are are things that are trying to drive some kind of social change even if it's just local in one place uh you know more than starting out because you want to make a bunch of money or or have a lot of people working for you or or build some company in some way so you know I always think that this is kind of a perverse thing about Silicon Valley in a way which is that you know people decide often that they want to start a company before they even decide what they want to do and that just feels really backwards to me and you know for anyone who's had the experience of actually building a company you know that you go through some really hard things along the way and I think part of what gets you through that is believing in what you're doing and knowing that what you're doing is is really delivering a lot of value for people um and and that's I think how the best companies end up getting made I I want to talk for a second about low points because I think people never appreciate how bad they really are and I think it's always reassuring to hear that even Mark Zuckerberg went through some serious low points and came out okay so can you tell us about some of the hardest parts in the history of the early history of Facebook yeah I think one of the hardest parts for me was um was actually when Yahoo offered to buy the company for for a lot of money because up until that point that was the turning point in the company where before that we uh every day we just come in and kind of do what we thought was the right next thing to do right we'd open to more schools we we open to high school and opened Beyond schools and um you know launched more photos so because because that's what it seemed like the next thing that that we needed to do to help people Express themselves and and understand more what was going on around them um but then you know Yahoo came in with this um with this really meaningful offer right I mean a billion dollars for this was how far into the company it was a couple of years in okay right and you know we had 10 million people using the product at the time right so it wasn't like it wasn't as if it were obvious that we were going to succeed far beyond that and that was the first point where we really had to um to look at the future and say wow um is what we're going to build um going to actually um be so much more meaningful for this and you know that caused a lot of interesting conversations in the company and and with our investors and you know at the end of that Dustin and I just decided you know no we think that we can actually go connect more than just the 10 million people who are in schools we can go beyond that and and have this really be a successful thing and we decided to go for it but that was really stressful because a lot of people really thought that we should sell the company and um and you know for a lot of folks who joined a startup I I feel like at that point I hadn't been very good about communicating that we were trying to go for this Mission yeah um you know we just showed up every day and and just kind of did what we thought was the the right next thing to do so for a lot of the folks who joined early on they they weren't really aligned with me right for them you know they they joined and um you know being able to sell a company for a billion dollars after a couple years was that was like a home run right and and it is a home run right and and that's you know I think that that's um I I get that but you know that I think that the fact I didn't communicate very well about what we were trying to do caused um caused this huge tension and the part that was painful wasn't wasn't turning down the offer it was the fact that after that um huge amounts of the company quit because they didn't believe in in what we were what we were doing right I mean if you look at the management team that we had did that whole management team leave the whole management team was gone within um within about a year after that did you ever regret that decision in that period like were there are times where you were like well we should have sold um you know we were I I got really lucky because you know not only did did what I believed in end up working out but it ended up working out pretty quickly right so literally you know I think this was in the summer of 2006 and by um I think the the next month after that we launched news feed which now 10 years later looking back at it as you know one of the most used products in the world and then we launched the ability for anyone to sign up which immediately started um growing the community so So within a few months after turning down the offer I think it was actually pretty clear that that it was the right decision but you know I think you know since then there have been much harder decisions that we've had to make where you know sometimes you have to you have to bet on something and and you know either you know bet the direction of the company or you know bet billions of dollars on something and it's not going to be clear whether you're right for five or 10 years and you know that I think actually can end up being much harder than than this what I want to talk about next but before we go there have you ever thought about selling the company again since no after that point that was just yeah got that out of the way we're going to hire people that want to be here for a long time and yeah cool um yes so I want to talk about one of the most common questions we get from people building products is how to decide what to build how to figure out when to bet the company how to do something totally new yeah and I think one thing that Facebook has done incredibly well is figure out what to build and be and build this repeated Innovation culture which I think is like the hardest thing to do in business so how have you done that and how do you advise other people to do the same I think the key is building a company which is focused on learning as quickly as possible Right companies are are learning organisms and you can make decisions that either make it so that you learn faster or you learn slower and you know in a lot of ways building a company is like following the scientific method right you you try a bunch of different hypotheses and if you set up the experiments well then you you kind of learn what to do and I think that's that's an important philosophy so there are all these different decisions that we make inside the company you know everything down to um really empowering individual Engineers we we invest in this huge um testing framework right at any given point in time there aren't there's not just one version of Facebook running in the world right there's probably tens of thousands of versions running because Engineers here have the power to um to try out an idea and and ship it to you know maybe 10,000 people or 100 thousand people and then they get a readout on how that version of what they did whether it was um a change to you know show better content in Newsfeed or or UI change or some new feature that they get a readout on how uh that version performed compared to the Baseline version of of Facebook that we have on on everything that we care about how how connected people are um you know how much people are sharing and how much they say that they're finding meaningful content uh business metrics like how how much revenue we make and an engagement of the overall community and you know by running tens of thousands of of different experiments and and putting the power in people's hands to try all these different things you can imagine we' just make so much more progress than we could if every change had to be approved by me right or or any every idea had to come from from management so I do think that there's something very deep about building this you know learning culture and moving quickly towards that that just helps you get ahead over time what about the the bigger bets like making a large acquisition or the roll out of Newsfeed or something like that how do how do those decisions work so I actually think when you do stuff well you don't you shouldn't have to do big crazy things right so you want to actually evolve in in a way where you're working with your community and making steps and learning so take Newsfeed for example that there was a relatively big shift but it actually had been a couple of years in the making by watching what how people were using the service right so you know when we started off we we didn't have anything like Newsfeed that showed you updates from from what people were sharing we just had profiles and what we found were originally one of the big behaviors was people would just click around right to they'd click on different profiles um you know hundreds of them just to and they'd go through all their friends to see what people had changed right to see what the update was and and um in in their friends day and we learned from that that people were not just interested in looking up and and learning about a person but also understanding the day-to-day changes so you know first we made this product that uh just showed in in order which of your friends and updated their profile right so that at least told you whose profile to click on and then you know the first version of Newsfeed was really simple all it did was it basically took the content that people were posting and put it in order on um on on your homepage um so I think when you're when when things are working well you you use data and you use the qualitative feedback that you're getting from from listening to how your community is using your product to tell you what problems to go go solve and then you basically use intuition to figure out what the solutions to those problems might be and then you test those hypotheses by by Rolling them out and getting more data and feedback on that and then that gives you a sense of where to go um you know when I look at things like you know we bought um you know the Oculus team for a lot of money right I actually view that as um you know if we' done a better job of building up some of the expertise to do some of that stuff internally then you know maybe we wouldn't had to do that but you know instead we we hadn't done that and you know the Oculus team is by far the most talented team working on that problem um so it just made sense to go make this big move but I actually kind of think as as CEO it's your job to not get into a position where you need to be doing these crazy things right you know of course it's it's inevitable you know over the period of doing stuff you'll um you know you can't be ahead of everything so it's better to um to make big moves and be willing to to do that then you know have pride and and not do that and never admit that you that you um could have done something better in the past but but I think when stuff is working well you're you're learning incrementally and and growing that way speaking of growing um one thing I heard you say years ago is that one of the best things Facebook had done was invent the idea of a growth group um and so this is something now that I've heard a lot of Founders ask about could you tell us um is that still something you recommend people running companies put in place and and how Facebook's worked in the early days so making it so we could grow faster was I I think the most important product feature that we uh ended up building for Facebook and you know the traditional approach to growing and marketing is you know you have a Communications Group or you have a marketing team and you buy ads and you know I think that there's some sometimes there's a place for for that um especially when you're trying to communicate something and and get a message out but if you're actually trying to um to grow a product I think the often the best lovers for doing that are within the product themselves and getting people in your community who enjoy what you're doing uh to evangelize that to their friends and getting that to and efficiently as efficiently as possible so you know there's no magic in the growth group that we um that we built that other people can't replicate you know it's it's just being very rigorous with data investing in data infrastructure so that way you can process all these different experiments and and learn what people are trying to tell you and um and then go invest engineering and actually um trying to grow the community because I think that that's the most important feature for a lot of networks and can you tell how much of an impact that group had on the growth rate of Facebook um yeah I think you know there overall I think it's been very big um I I don't have a number off the top of my head but I mean even just looking at you know some of these specific features that we've built like people you may know right which is yeah um you know one of the important things right again if you're you know a social product isn't that useful if you're not connected to other people you when you're using it so you know helping you go from signing up for Facebook to connecting to the people that you care about most is probably one of the most important things that we can do another thing that I think Facebook has done exceptionally well is hiring and and I always tell Founders that this is the thing you have to get good at so how have you hired your team uh and and what do you look for when you bring people on if you think about it you know I started the company when I was 19 right so I can't institutionally believe that experience is that important right or else I would have a hard time reconciling um you know myself right and and and and the company so you know we invest in in people who we think are just really talented even if they haven't done that thing before and you know that applies to people who are fresh out of University as well as you know people like um you know the CFO who took the company public had not taken a company public before right and a lot of his background was in um you know production um development at Genentech before so you know just focus on really talented people and so if you don't have the experience to look for how do you assess someone's Raw Talent um well often you can tell from different things that they've done right so it's it's not that you know obviously everyone's done something right I mean if even if you're 19 right you've um you've done side projects and and interesting stuff um and you know I think what's what's important is not to believe that someone has to have specifically done the job that they're going to do in order to be able to to do it well one of the things that I think we've done well is is just giving the people at the company a lot of opportunity right so you know it's not just me Who start started when I was 19 and and now you know I'm running this big company there were a number of people who joined who were you know people I did problem sets with at Harvard or they dropped out of Stanford or you know different programs who have grown with the company over this long period of time and you know one of the things that I'm the most proud of is we have about 12 different product groups of the company and all of the people who are running them um with the exception of of uh one uh did not join the company running a product group or reporting to me that's amazing um and the one exception was is David Marcus who was the CEO of a you know $50 billion public company so um you know so I'm pretty happy that that that that he's on board and and having him run a product group I think is a pretty big coup too but literally none of them started off reporting to me um you know they all start off in different in different roles some were engineers some were data analysts um some were product managers and they've all grown but I think what happens is you know people see that you create opportunities for people and and that also I think keep the best people engaged and makes the best people want to come work at your company because they feel like oh I'm going to get those kind of opportunities too cool yeah what do you most excited about over the next 20 years what do you think will be the major Transformations how will Facebook transform how do you think the rest of the world will transform so we have this 10-year road map of Great you know three of the the big changes that we want to see in the world and we're focused on three things connectivity right so getting everyone in the world on the internet right now more than you know more than half the world is not on the internet which is you know I think a lot of people in in Silicon Valley probably take this for granted right the the internet because you know it's it just is not uniformly available and if we want to solve a lot of the the big challenges of the world today there are not problems that any one group of people or even one country can solve right they they really involve coming together and giving everyone an opportunity to participate in in solving them um so I think connecting everyone is is really a key thing which is going to um be be great for for people around the world uh the next one is AI I think that that's just going to unlock so much potential in so many different domains and you know we use it at Facebook for a lot of different things for showing people content that they're going to find more meaningful um for making sure that you um connect with the people you actually care about on the service but in a lot of ways the work that we're doing on AI to push the fundamental uh you know state-ofthe-art forward is exactly the same stuff that's going into systems that diagnose diseases better right or find better drugs to treat people or um that you know other companies are using when they build self-driving cars and you know these are things that are going to save lives right I mean if you can you know I heard this story recently that at this conference where someone has built um a machine learning application where you can take a picture of a lesion on someone's skin and it can detect instantly uh whether it's skin cancer with the accuracy of the best dermatologists and and doctors in the world so you know I mean who doesn't want that right now like you're going to be able to put the power in your doctor's hand uh to become the best doctor in the world at that thing everyone will be the best doctor in the world and that's a really fundamental thing right that um you know I I get a little bit frustrated I think when people um you know fearmonger about about Ai and how it it could end up hurting people because I think in in many real ways around diseases around driving more safe I me this is going to save people's lives and push and push people forward so that that's a really big deal I think for the next 10 years and then you know the next thing that that I always think is is going to make a big difference is um you know every 10 or 15 years there's a new major Computing platform that comes around that allows people to do completely different things than they could do before right so you know 20 years ago you know most of us were using desktop computers they were kind of clunky you know we use them in in work because it made our work more productive but most people didn't use them for fun now we have phones which you know help us connect with each other and they're much more human devices but there's going to be another platform after that and I think that's going to be uh virtual reality and augmented reality um and that I think is just going to help people you know be more creative um experience what other people are feeling much more immersively than than we even can through um through video and things like that today so I'm really excited about that Trend as well so you were 19 when you started Facebook um one question we hear a lot at why combinator is I'm 19 today I really want to you know do whatever I can to make the world better what should I do so so how do you advise people who are 19 today and want to impact the world like you have you know I I always think that the most important thing that entrepreneurs should do is pick something they care about work on it but don't actually commit to turning it into a company until it's working and I think that if you look at the data of like the very best companies that have gotten built I I actually think a tremendous percent of them have been built that way and not from people decided upfront that they wanted to start a company cuz you just get locked into some local minimum a lot of the time a local maximum I totally agree and just to make this point how how far into Facebook did it actually become a company um I don't know I think probably I think it became a a a formal Delaware company when Peter teal invested about 6 months in when we were first talking to Peter about raising money Dustin and I were very clear with him that we were planning on going back to school right I mean our um you know I started Facebook when I was a sophomore we took the summer off right no classes over the summer we were working on it and then you know our our stated game plan was to go back to school in the fall and continue working on it then but not like sit sit in an office and work on it fulltime and Peter was just kind of like all right Sher you are I guess he knew better than we did you think he just believed that you weren't actually going to go back to school he must have I mean you'd have to ask him but I will we're interviewing him in this series I will ask that question so I I think he would probably say that he knew that we were not going to go back to school or believed that he could talk us out of it but he didn't have to it was it was pretty clear that the amount of work was just growing so quickly but we actually didn't drop out immediately we we told Harvard that we were taking one semester off and and then we told Harvard that we were taking another semester off and then a year off and then after that we kind of decided we weren't going back uh speaking of Peter in sort of a closing question what what's the best piece of advice he ever gave you I think Peter was the person who who told me this really piy quote that in a world that's changing so quickly the biggest risk you can take is not taking any risk and I I really think that that's true right I mean a lot of people I think think that um you know whenever it comes to whenever you get yourself into a position where you have to make some some big shift in in direction or do something um you know there always people are going to point to the the downside risks of that decision and locally there may be right right I mean for any given decision that you're going to make there's upside and downside but in aggregate if you are stagnant and you don't make those changes then um then I think you're guaranteed to fail right and and not not catch up so to some degree I think it's really right that overtime the biggest risk that you can take is to not take any risks that is a great place to leave it thank you very much all right"

Please go through those links so you get accurate pricing. and I appreciate your support for the return of the rat tour. Today's guest is an entrepreneur. He's an inventor. He's a philanthropist. Um he is one of the richest men in the world and it's you know and a consensus of wealth and power exists and only so few people. He co-founded Facebook in 2004 when he was 19 years old. the company that turned into Meta, which is where we are today in their headquarters. Uh, I'm thankful to spend time and get to know Mr. Mark Zuckerberg and I will find a song. [Applause] You drink coffee, man, or no? No. Really? Yeah. I mean, you've you've had it? I have. Um, sometimes on vacation, I'll drink it recreationally. It's like every once in a while. Just like a Yeah. Just like like a celebration. Yeah. Really? Yeah. No, I I just like hate anything that messes with like I don't I don't like any kind of chemicals or anything like that. Oh, really? So, you like to keep everything the equilibrium? Yeah. My sister gives me such a hard time about that. She's like, \"You're just sitting there raw dogging reality.\" Wow. It's kind of true. Like, so you But have you you've had it before? Yeah. But you just don't like it. Yeah. Yeah. I don't like it. I don't like it. So, when you get up in the morning, that's not your thing? Like, is there something you do? No. No. No. Yeah. I mean, I wake up and I uh I fight people. Yeah. Um Yeah. No, I mean I I wake up in the morning and are we going, by the way? I mean, we should we should get this. Yeah, we're going. What's up? All right. Oh, you mean you wake up and do jiu-jitsu, you mean? Oh, yeah. Yeah. So, I probably wake up like I don't know 7 7:30 whenever like the kids start making noise around the house. It's like all right and sleep is done. Yeah. And and then like it's like I look at my phone and I'm just like all these things that these people are doing like you did what? Are you [ __ ] kidding me? It's like I have to go [ __ ] deal with this. It's like like it's like this partner are really god damn it. All right. So, and then it's like I compose myself and go fight for two hours, like reenter myself. Then it's like now I can go deal with the stuff. But no, it's um so that helps. It's almost like your coffee in the morning sometimes like rolling like rolling jiu-jitsu kind of. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean right now I'm doing more striking so I really fun. I I just I think it's like the greatest sport. I mean it's um it's like neurologically stimulating. It's uh you know it's good cardio, good strength. Oh yeah. um a little bit of a threat, right? So it keeps you on, you know, it's not not like just like running. I used to like run around the neighborhood, but running is not that thrilling. Running compared to jiu-jitsu is for running is a running is not really neat once you can do jiu-jitsu because I think one cool thing about jiu-jitsu is just like you can lose a match with somebody, right? You can lose like um like they can submit you but you'll learn something along the way, right? And they a lot of times the guy submitting you also wants to help you learn too. So it's like you can lose and win at the same time. I think that's what's kind of masterful about it. Yeah. Totally. Do you do you do it? I don't do it as much as I would like to, you know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Striking like that. Yeah. Yeah. No, I never got into striking, but I would just kind of like um but I would just do jiu-jitsu on the mats, you know. Oh, yeah. No, it's so fun. It's just like fun to do with friends and Oh, yeah. and some guy chokes you so hard and then you're just like god you're like h it's a good day. It's Yeah, it's just Yeah, it's a cup of coffee. Yeah. If a big fella just squeezing you until you can't handle it, it's a cup of coffee. Better than caffeine for me. Yeah. I don't know. I I'm just not into that stuff. Is there a like a is there like um a vitamin or some staple that you kind of keep in your diet if it's not caffeine? Is there some like I drink a very large amount of protein? I mean creatine. Do you do you count that? I mean I don't know. Yeah. Um I don't know. Vitamin D, like all that stuff. Yeah, vitamin's good, but um but like Yeah, it's not your thing. No. No. Never been my thing. I um Yeah. Where did I see? Oh, we saw each other at the UFC. And you and your wife were there, right? Uh yeah. Which one was that? I'm trying to think. It wasn't 312. Was that That was Alex fighting Magd. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I was sad about that, man. Yeah. Yeah. Dude, your wife I could see she could like really it it like she was like head in her hand sometimes. Yeah. No, I think um she uh I think she would say she enjoys it, but I think she mostly goes to uh to support me. Um Yeah. No, she's into it. I think um you know, it's tough. I mean, we've gotten to know a bunch of the fighters, and it's just like when you see someone who you know and like get hit or go down, that's like that's tough, right? Right. I mean, it's like I I've gotten to uh like train with Vog a few times and um you know, we were there at 298 when he fought Ilia and like Oh, yeah. That was like and that was like really tough. Did you get to walk out with him or No. Yeah. I mean, he asked me to to to walk out with him and I was like, \"All right, yeah, this will be a cool experience.\" And then I'm just like, you know, standing there while they're walking. Did you see that whole meme where where they're uh like he's like passing off all his clothes and I'm just like sitting there like uh useless? Yeah. No, there you go. That was that was a fun that was a fun one. Was that scary? Like what? Cuz I guess you feel like Yeah. What do I do now? No, I mean this was a fun moment. But but I mean but watching him um get hit by Ilia. So I mean it was like right cage shot. It was like three feet from us and I mean he's like a big like he's like a tough guy, right? And u so that that was that was tough. Um but so I think after that Priscilla was like oh man I don't know if I can go watch Vulcan in person again. But but we I mean you know I mean we just have friends over. It was fun watching him fight Diego. It was good. It was a great fight. It was great. It was awesome. Tough tough moments in in round two and four. But he's his heart man like I mean the way he described it after like did you see the the shot in round four where Diego grazed his eyelid with his glove. Yeah. And he lost his vision and and he like and you could see it was kind of like like just the the head movement and everything trying to survive. It's like watching an animal try to survive on one of those Animal Planet shows or something when you're cheering for the, you know, you're like, \"Oh, it's not going to go well.\" But then he does good. Yeah. No. Um he he's an amazing guy. Um he's he's he's really cool. Very talented. A lot of heart. Oh, yeah. And you get to know some of the fighters. I think that's one thing that um is great about social media these days that you get to know the fighters a little bit more, some of their regular live. Like you can get involved in who they are. So that gives you so much more of a person to cheer for. Um, is it tough to take your wife since you're a um and I'm just just going to go for it. Since you're a I'm going to say the word really fast just so it's like uh so we don't dwell on it, but since you're a billionaire, is it tough to take your wife on a date like at that you know like do you have to live up to a standard or what's like a like a nice date night? What is that like? Um I don't know. No, I think she's pretty chill. Um she's a chillionaire. Yeah, sorry. My niece will like it. Yeah, there you go. Um, no, I mean I I think the the main thing for me is like like life is busy. There's like a million things that I could be doing at any given point in time. I I just think it's important to like take time, you know, each week. Like, you know, Wednesday night, we really try to have a date night. Um, you know, try to hang out with the kids and put them to bed every night. It's like that. That's just like an important part of my routine. I think I think that's important stuff to do. But but no, I mean uh we we try to like go out somewhere, but every once in a while we'll just cook or or eat at home and and that's all good. The UFC stuff I think is probably more for me than for her. But but she's she's she's a good sport about it. Is there something you'll do for her like or is there like a fancy date cuz you you can afford to take your wife on like a date of like that that a lot of us could only dream of, right? That most that most people could only dream of. Is there something that like a is there some magical date that you took her on one time? Um, I don't know. That is a good question. Let's see. She's she's pretty simple on this stuff. I think most of the, you know, I I like doing I like making things, right? So, I don't know if you saw this thing. I like I I like working with like great artists and stuff. So, I I did this project where I've always admired Daniel Arsham and and um he's he's this like great sculptor and we and I I worked with him to make this sculpture of Priscilla because I thought it was cool and um yeah, you're pulling this up and the and like Oh, yeah. First of all, I think it's like, you know, make a sculpture of Priscilla partially because that's cool, partially because I'm like I'm not going to make a sculpture of myself. It's like that that's crazy, right? It's like who the [ __ ] does that but like um so so it's like she's kind of the target of my creative energy in a way. So there's all these memes online after Yeah, there you go. where people like wow I wonder what Zuckerberg did wrong that he had to make a sculpture of his wife and I'm like no you guys are totally missing this. This is the thing I did wrong. It's like you can't like you're going to have to wait to see what I have to do to make up for having made a sculpture and putting it on our front lawn. And it's like she doesn't want a sculpture of her in the front lawn. It's like that's that's weird, right? It's like, you know, it's but um No, but she she's a good sport about it. And um that and at least you can tell the Door Dash guy like just set it by the sculpture. Just by the sculpture. Yeah. Yeah. That's kind of nice. It becomes like a um and an I think having like a woman as a lookout in your yard is kind of nice, you know? Yeah. No, it's got like a good angelic form factor thing. It's a It's a good vibe. Did she make you make any adjustments to it or was she like, \"Okay, I'll accept it as is.\" Um, no. I mean, I don't think she was that happy with it. Um, because again, I mean, like, who wants a sculpture of themselves in in the in the in the front yard? But, um, but, you know, I think she thinks it's sweet and I think she appreciates that. Um, I mean, there's a lot of like more destructive things I could be doing with my creative energy. Yeah. You made an effort, too. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, um, and so it's like I I designed her this, um, this, uh, Porsche minivan thing. It's like we took like a Cayenne and extended it to be bigger. And it's like I do that cuz it's like, all right, I like cars, but I'm not going to design a super car for myself. Let's like just design a sweet minivan for my wife, right? It's like, yeah, it was just fun. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, I guess creative stuff like that, trying to be creative and show her some creativity. Oh, that's nice. There you go. I mean, look at that. And where did you meet your wife at? Um, I met her in school. So, at at we were in college and I had just done this prank. Um, and all my friends and everyone was convinced they were all convinced I was going to get thrown out of school. Okay. And where were you at in school at, Mark? Harvard. Okay. And so, so I was a sophomore, she was a freshman. Um, my friends were convinced I was about to get kicked out of school. I was like going in front of this like trial for the kind of like school discipline committee. Um my friends threw a going away party for me and it was in the bathroom line at the end of the party. Um where I was just like next to Priscilla and we were talking and you had nothing to lose. It was your last meal. I was just like look man like it's you know have I didn't say man but it's um like it was not not very romantic situations. It's like we're waiting in line for the bathroom. She's just funny. She She's cute. And it's like I was like, \"All right, hey, you know, if we're going to go out, we better go do this quickly cuz I'm probably going to get kicked out of school in like two or three days.\" It's like that's a good pickup line, right? It's like, yeah, that's that's how you really show that you have potential in the world, right? It's, you know, it's Well, it's a limited time offer. Yeah. But it's not like very aspirational. It's like, hey, that's true. It's like I'm um going nowhere in life and um I'm I'm about to get kicked out of school so you're going to want to you know you're going to want to go out with me really quickly. Um Right. It's like Yeah. Yeah. I guess another way to look at it is very sail rack in a way you know. Very sail rack. Yeah. So but but I mean but everyone I knew thought that this whole thing was over. I mean my parents drove up. We lived in New York. They drove up to help me pack up my dorm room cuz they're like it's over. You're coming home. Yeah. Um but um it didn't. Then of course I I made Facebook and a few months later I dropped out anyway. So jokes on them. But um but but that's that's how uh Yeah. No, that's Did you have to go to the trial at school or you didn't? Oh no, I did. And and it was like the questions that they asked were even worse than the questions that I get at like the congressional hearings. It was like, \"Don't you know that once you put this terrible prank website online, it is there forever?\" And it's like, \"No, actually that's not how it works. The site's already down.\" Um, they're like, \"You're a smartass.\" And I'm like, \"Yeah, that's probably true. That's probably true.\" But but half of a smart ass also is smart. Yeah. I'll take that. It's better than being a dumbass. Yeah. Well, you know, it's like maybe smart and a little bit of an ass. And, you know, it works. Yeah. Yeah, I'd rather be a smartass, I think. Um, do you know about um what was a prank site? What was it? That wasn't Facebook, though. No, no, it was this thing called Face Mash. Um, which you know, in the whole lore of the thing, there's this whole movie that got made about all this stuff. They made it seem like Face Mash was a predecessor to Facebook. It wasn't. I when I was in college, I I just like making things. Yeah. So, whether it's statues or minivans or internets or glasses, like whatever, you know, I just like making stuff. So, you like being creative. Yeah. So I So like I um uh so it was it was it was it was very mean-spirited. It was very meanspirited. I basically I downloaded everyone's ID photos um from their ID cards and I made this site where it showed two photos and you clicked on the person you thought was more attractive and then it used and it basically look took all the matchups and ranked everyone in the school based on um oh who everyone thought was the most attractive. Very mean-spirited in retrospect. Um not connected to Facebook in any way, right? but just like just just like just a college kid kind of being a jerk. Um but you know it's like okay. So that was not not my not my best move. Um but you got to take B you know it's baby steps. I mean and also pretty cool to make something. Some of the things I did were were were useful and fun. That one I put it together in a weekend. Not my best work as um Yeah. No, not my best work. But that's fair. Not your best work, you know. Yeah. We've all had things we made that weren't, you know, that weren't the best probably. Did you um let me think what I'm going to ask you. Oh, did you um What kind of car do you drive? What kind of car do you drive? Uh right now, Blackwing CT5. Um I It's a Cadillac. It's nice. It's um It's uh Here, pull it up. It's uh I I really like driving manual transmission cars. Oh, yeah. Huh. And um I like that type of thing, baby. It's uh it's a good one. Oh god, that's nice. Yeah, that thing will just shift. That thing just gets shifty out there. No, it's good. It's good. It's got a nice little on it. I feel like you want your car to have almost as much horsepower as your helicopter. I feel like as a rule of thumb, it's probably a rule of a very rich thumb. Definitely. Yeah. So for a while, okay, so my security team kind of convinced me for like 10 years that I should just let them drive me places, which I mean, realistically I probably should, but um but then eventually I was just like, I can't I can't I can't do this. It's like I like I need like the freedom. I need to be able to drive myself. So I started learning how to fly helicopters. And then I was like, all right, well, this is just ridiculous. So, it's like we have the security team driving me to my helicopter that I then go fly away. It's like that makes no sense. It's like I'll just let's just go let's get a car. It's kind of Batman almost has a Batman vibe, but I guess it is true because then you're just by yourself out there. What do you mean? Or will you take somebody with you in the car? Oh, no. No. In the car or the helicopter? Helicopter. Yeah, I definitely have like a real professional pilot fly with me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that's wild though. Yeah. But I guess a chopper would get you somewhere pretty quick, right? Uh, yeah. I mean, it's it's a good it's a good tool to have in the arsenal. Unreal. No, it's um like a damn emperor, dude. Does that feel like that ever? No. Um, man, it's like I feel like I wish that people did what I wanted them to do. It's like that would be that would be fun. But, but in the meantime, you could have some fun. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I would have a chopper. I'd have a I don't even know what I would have. I would have an underground tunnel even though it came right back up next to where it started. I do. I do have an underground tunnel. Do you really? Yeah. Yeah. in this ranch in Kawaii. Yeah. Where there's this whole thing where people are like there's this whole meme about how people are saying I built this like bunker underground. It's it's like more of underground storage situation. But um but yeah, no, it's uh it's a Oh, wow. Zucky got that bunky. What's under the ground? Just more water, right? It's basically what you just said. It's sort of a tunnel that just goes to another building. Yeah. But it's a good place to hide a little bit of dope though. I that's what I would say, dude. Those are the good that's what I would do anyway. But um you and I defer there. Yeah. So you don't use you've never used drugs or I mean I I don't know. Dare really worked on me when I was in third grade. It's like I don't know. There's all this stuff about how it like how it it backfired and like it just kind of taught people how to use drugs. For me it like really scared me. It was like I don't no I don't like any of that stuff. It's like a friend will show up and be like, \"I was like getting um an IV to feel better.\" It's like I don't even want people to like extend their arm and show me their vein. Like it's like that [ __ ] Like no man. Yeah, that's true, dude. No, I'm I'm raw dogging reality as my god. Yeah. No, it's there's kind of a that's kind of insane really these days. It used to be kind of that somebody who was like really straight edge and sober that they was that that was a nerdy thing I think. But now I never even thought about it before. Now, that's almost the most insane thing you can do. It's like, wait, you're under the influence of nothing. Nothing. Nothing. From sun up to sun down. You're a [ __ ] animal, you know? It's kind of crazy that it's that that things have gone that that uh that that the perspect perspective of that has kind of changed. How big is that tunnel? Is your tunnel pretty big or what's it like? Uh, it's not that big of a tunnel. It's I I made a I put a real on Instagram one day of um of of Priscilla kind of making fun of me playing video games with some friends down there. But it's uh uh yeah, no it's it's it's all good. Um yeah, definitely. But this is a crazy area. I haven't spent a lot of time. You know how the internet is. The internet will will always make things seem like they're crazier than they are. But you know, once an under I mean in Hawaii it's like having a having a little storm shelter underground tunnel is pretty stupid. That's the thing right there. No, I don't think so. I someone's wondering. Is that Roblox? Who built it for you? It's closer to Roblox than uh than than what than what the thing is. Dude, the future's def Things are definitely getting weird with cars. Is Dude, I saw four Whimos meeting up behind the IKEA over here. Having a meeting, huh? Yeah. Deciding what they're going to do next. Just like what's your next move? Kind of was like where you going? Who you? Yeah. I think Have you seen Hot Tub Time Machine? Um I haven't seen it. You You would like that. That's good. Yeah. No, I think that there's uh there's the self-driving car that's like hunting down the guy who was mean to it in it. It's it's uh it's good. Yeah, that's what it see Yeah, that's what it seemed like. Dude, there was four I don't know if they were smoking a blunt or whatever, but there was four Whimos all meeting. Yeah, I don't know. They were meeting up. I'm like, what who are they? What are they doing? You know, and then my buddy said he was in one and it was um crying to him because it like the Whimo was crying. Yeah, the Whimo was like complaining about his spouse or whatever and it was like what form does that take? I don't know. Is it like speaking English or is it like R2-D2? No, I think he had set it on a British setting. So, it was like, \"Oh, me Mrs. is really getting at me.\" No. So, I think cuz you can change the voice to like Indian guy or British guy or whatever or like um or uh female or semi-female or whatever. Female. But like Yeah, I just think it like Yeah, just some of that Whimo stuff's just getting out of line. I never thought like, oh, what are these cars doing? Until I saw four of them meeting up and I was like, this seems like a lot to me. You know, that's where the future starts to get a little bit scary is moments like that. You're like, well, what are they doing? What were they doing? Probably just waiting to pick people up. But they have to do it to in a group behind an IKEA. Yeah, I don't know what that does seem like an unlikely place to pick people up. That's true. And well, it just see I'm not going to defend them. Okay. Okay. Okay. It just seemed like an interesting place to meet up, you know. Um, yeah. And then I I was in I was in one way mo and it was like you want to gamble and I think it was like sponsored by DraftKings or something and it was like you want to gamble with me Yeah. I was like it's like I bet you $40 you'll never get where you're going. And it was like this is this seems as the doors lock. Yeah. It's like picks up speed. Yeah. Yeah. And why are all the Whimos white too? I'm like, this is I don't know. I just think we got to start to diversify the portfolio. I feel like a little, you know. Yeah. But what do I know? Um you So, let me switch topics. Sorry. Sometimes I get a little bit nervous. Is that all right? Yeah. Okay. I mean, there's no way that you're uh less uh nervous than me. Let me think about how you said that. Yeah. Let me think about that, too. Did I More nervous? More nervous. Yeah. See, I I didn't even say it correctly. Really? Oh, but I think that's a trap. I think that I am I think I'm more nervous than you. You think? Yeah, man. I wake up. I am a an alarm clock. That's how I feel all the time. I feel like What does that mean? I just feel like I'm always, you know, you know, I don't know. I just think I've always felt like that. I've always felt like kind of frenetic, you know? It's like how do I get things to calm down more than how do I get things to amp up, you know? M um like I'll even wear earplugs a lot of the day now and it makes things a lot easier for me to kind of navigate. Interesting. Yeah. It just makes everything easier to focus on. It makes it easier if I'm doing sauna, steam bath, ice bath, working out, any of those things. It makes it everything. You wear earbuds in the I'll wear earplugs. Okay. Oh, I see. Okay. And I wear them all night while it just makes everything a lot easier. Ready to win some real cash during the basketball playoffs? Check out Pick Six from DraftKings.

Um you you dropped out of college, right? Yeah. And um Alexander Wang, he came on one time. He and and we were talking about him earlier, but he had dropped out of college also. Is that a Do you think people need college still or cuz it's just, you know, that you have these creative guys who were having success and they didn't go through college. Do you feel like people still need college? What do you feel like that looks like for now in the future? I don't know. Well, I mean, college, there's a question of how much of it is about the learning and how much of it is about the kind of like learning how to be a grown-up before you kind of go out into the world. Um, I mean, for me, it's like the the classes were fine. I mean, that was a fun sort of entertaining part of of college, but I mean I met a lot of people who were really important in my life, right? But it's like I mean Priscilla, my co-founders at um at the company um a bunch of people who are still friends, close friends to to this day. Um so I think that's almost more of it than um than like whatever class you took, right? Um but yeah. Yeah. That's just that socialist learning to be around others, learning to not be at your parents house. Yeah. And I mean and I went to boarding school for two years. Um, and then before I went to to college for two years. So I feel like even though I dropped out of college, I kind of got a full experience in a way um on that. But it was good. I I feel like you just like, you know, you need some time kind of away from home a bit before you like fully go out. But um so I I don't know. I I think that that'll be a thing. Um but I I do think like a lot of people I'm not sure that college is preparing people for like the jobs that they need to have today. I mean, I think that that's like there's a big issue on that and like all the student debt issues are like really big issues. I mean, the fact that college is it's just so expensive for so many people and then like you graduate and you're in debt. Um well, you're not even guaranteed a job either. You would think at a certain rate you're paying you'd be guaranteed some sort of beginner employment. Yeah. Know, I think that's that's probably the big the the biggest issue with it is it would be one thing if it were just kind of like a a social experience, but you started off neutral. the the fact if if it's not preparing you for the jobs that you need and you're kind of starting off in this big hole, then I I think that's that's not good. I mean, that that I think there's gonna have to be a reckoning with and people are going to have to to kind of figure out whether that makes sense. But I I don't know. people, it's sort of been this taboo thing to say of like like maybe not everyone needs to go to college and because there's like a lot of jobs that don't require that and um but I think people are probably coming around to that opinion a little more now than than um than maybe like 10 years ago. Yeah. Do you think I was just talking earlier um with Colin I think one of your assistants one of your co-workers sorry I don't say assistants but um and we're kind of saying that um yeah like what classes do you think like kids should be learning now because like with AI coming along and with technology starting to like really multiply itself pretty quickly like our ability to advance is is going to only grow faster it seems like would you feel That's true. Overall statement. Oh yeah, totally. I think it's accelerating. Yeah, accelerating. Yeah, that's the word I'm looking for. Sorry. So, with that happening, what are like I feel like they should be teaching how to like kind of use AI to children right now in elementary and middle schools. Does that that sounds very real to me? Do you feel like that that's like not not how to code or anything, but just how to do it? So, I mean, it's interesting because the technology changes a lot, right? It's obviously it's a lot different now than it was 20 years ago when I got started with the company or when I started coding when I was a kid. So, it's not like the specific things I learned to code when I was 15 are the skills I'm using today. But you I don't know. I I think there is something about kind of understanding the technology and understanding how to use it and getting on that train that I think is is valuable. But the other thing is I I just think like having good mentors or teachers no matter what the actual classes. Like when I was in boarding school, um I really liked studying Latin and Greek and that's like not useful for any practical thing, but it's uh but it's it's fun and like it's fun. It's fun. It's fun. I think it's there are parts of it that are fun for sure. And the tests that we that I had to take were, you know, it's they would, you know, you'd be reading these kind of great works. Um, and the test would be they'd pull out any word in like whatever the, you know, third of a book was that was kind of that that kind of section of the class. and they they'd like show you a sentence and they they'd say, \"Okay, this word like give us the full kind of grammatical and and like poetic significance of um of kind of how this word is used by this author in this piece.\" So, okay, I'm not like I'm not that good at language. Um, so the way that I did that class was I basically just sat and studied word by word the like historical significance of of each word over like tens of pages. Um, you know, preparing for these exams and okay, I don't remember that much of that at this point, right? I mean, there were a few quotes that I think are pretty good from some of those books, but um, and I put them on shirts, but um, have you pluron? Have you heard that one? Yeah, no, that's a good one. What does that one mean? let's blow or whatever from from many one. I think it's talking about how we come together as as a as a people or as states into one union. Oh, that's nice. Um but no, I um but so you did it word by word, but it still helped you. But I I just think like the lesson from that is uh you know, it kind of gave me this confidence that it's like okay that was like a crazy thing to do, right? to have to like go learn what every word's significance like poetic significance and grammatical the structure and all that is. Um, and after I took that class, I was basically like I can work hard enough to do anything that I want, right? cuz look, I just like [ __ ] learned all these words that don't matter um in order to like nail this thing and like and I won and and and kind of did that and and got that to to kind of and kind of you had some fun doing it. So, Right. It's like you like you found a a model kind of Yeah, exactly. that worked and it was hard. It was a it was a tough model. Yeah. So, I mean there's like there's that and there's like the math version of that. I mean, you're talking about Alexander Wang on here. It's like I mean I did a bunch of um the same kind of math competitions that that he did. I had this like super hardcore math instructor in high school. His name was Zuming Fun. And he um Chinese guy. Oh yeah. And um I think at some point he he had worked with um Zooming Fong. Bring him Zooming Fong. Now he is We want the Fong. You ever hear that song? They used to play that. Well, this guy's just like a badass and he he basically was involved in training the um the US math olympiad team for for a long period of time and and he um he made a huge impact on on me kind of growing up and um and and he kind of taught me a little bit about like how I approached problems. He's like, \"Look, you actually um\" He's like, he's like, \"You kind of have this.\" He's like, \"Look, you're not that good at math.\" I'm like, \"No, no.\" But um I'm kidding. Um he he he kind of taught me that I I had this sort of like intuitive ability to have a sense of like what zone the right answer was in. So he's like, I look at your work and you do a bunch of stuff that like doesn't really make sense, but then at the end you come to a conclusion and you realize that that conclusion doesn't make sense and then you kind of check yourself and go back and do it. You keep on doing it until you get the right answer. He's like, I I don't understand how you like have this intuitive sense for like what the shape of the right answer is, but like that's really good. As long as you like couple that with working really hard, you're going to be able to kind of succeed and get a lot um and get a lot done. Um but so that give you a map of how to navigate yourself like your intuition with your hard work. Yeah. So so I don't know. So okay like does the specific like you know highdimensional geometry or whatever the thing is that we were working on together like do I do any of that today? No. I I don't remember any of that stuff. But like but I think it's like like you have some good teachers who teach you how to think and how to work hard and like that stays with you forever. And I think that that's like some of the stuff that um I mean I think it it builds confidence. It like teaches you how you approach problems. Then you just get better and better at at some things and you you build confidence. And so that's the value you're saying in seeing in college. Like those are some of the other values you might not see like oh yeah that might be not be able to be seen on paper but the but the value of that Yeah. That's a good point man. It's like, yeah, I remember like some of my favorite people still to this day in my life have been some of my teachers that challenged me or that believed in me or that said a certain like, man, I admire the way you do this or this, you know, and um and it really encourages you and wants kind of plants a lot of seeds to make you want to do those things so much more. Yeah. And and they don't have to be teachers, although obviously, you know, that's from mentors. I think a lot of a lot of these days a lot of people get their mentorship probably, I would guess, from teachers unless they play a sport, you know. Yeah. I mean, I think, you know, the main way that you learn though is from colleagues, right? It's like people you you work with. Um, you know, and I I remember, you know, growing up, I I was like I was really into computers and like when you get your first computer, you think? Um, so my family had a computer probably when I was like eight or nine and then I think I probably got one and would you be there on that thing all the time just riding the key? So my my dad's a dentist and and like he's like I just got a tooth yesterday. Yeah. Yeah. How's that? How's that? There you go. I just got a a half of a uh got to see Dr. Zuckerberg. Really? It's he'll take care of you. Um did your parents give you love or just sonic care? Uh that's just an old dentist joke. Um glad you got that taken care of. Yeah, I feel a lot better about it. But um what were we talking about? Oh, I was just talking about how my my dad was the type of dentist who like was really into technology, right? So whenever like a new laser thing came out to like drill your teeth better, like he was on that first, right? And and and that was kind of cool to to be around, right? It's and and kind of see like he he clearly he loved technology. Um and I think I sort of got introduced to a bunch of stuff through that. So like he had like in his dental office there were like a bunch of different um you know operate operatory rooms I guess and and they each had computers and I was like all right you know like oh yeah the future in there. Yeah. It's like you it's like but it was still you know he'd still like go between them to talk to the different people. I was like you need like a chat app so you can just like send messages to everyone across the the dental office. So I like wrote that for him and I was like all right that's cool. Um, so you were coding. So you were d you were putting coding in like dental war. You were you were already thinking of how to connect things like making stuff. Yeah. So yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean that's sort of been the theme for me is the intersection between like computing technology on the one hand and like people and connecting people. Um, you know, when I was in college I I wasn't there for long but I mean I was technically a psychology major. I mean, I took a bunch of computer science and math classes, too. But, dude, if somebody even went to Harvard for 4 days, dude, I would hire him to be my therapist or whatever. Yeah, I wouldn't really. I mean, I don't know. I think I' I'd rather have someone who I I definitely subscribe to the theory of like you want people who did well at whatever they did, not just like who have some random credential. So, Oh, yeah. Um, so yeah, I guess but where I'm from, if you heard Harvard, it was like somebody had gone to like Mars or something. It was very, you know, Yeah. No, I get it. So, but I think so it kind of differs from place to place whenever you drop whenever you did you have to tell your parents you were dropping out of college. Was that a crazy day? Did you DM them or what you do? Uh, so I mean I'd already started Facebook and Harvard had this nice policy where you you didn't have to make a hard decision to drop out. You could just postpone. So I just didn't go back for the next term. Later, my mom told me that she always knew I wasn't going to finish college. I was like, \"Mom, what the hell does that mean?\" But um, no, but actually, but that's got to be the worst. Imagine this. Okay, say your son or child or daughter or mixed RA or mixed child or whatever. Imagine it's a big test at school, right? You have to hug your kid goodbye. You know your kid is not going to do good on that test, right? But you still have to stand in there in the kitchen and give him a little bit of chocolate milk and be like, \"You're gonna do good out there today. Benny or whatever his name is, right?\" But then the second he leaves, you're just like, \"That kid doesn't have a It's like, you know, Benny's screwed.\" Benny's screwed. Yeah. Um, no, I don't know. I don't know what it's like. No, but my younger sister. Is our conversation going okay? I feel like it's cool you. Yeah. No, this is Yeah. I mean, it's it's less random than I expected to be, you know? It's It is. I'm just kidding. Yeah. I think it's just hard to talk sometimes to people. No, before I went to college, my No, my mom, I think, told me that she thought I was going to drop out. My younger sister bet me that she was going to finish college before me. Oo, I like that attitude. And And I was like, \"No, I'm going to get a degree.\" And they all came true. I dropped out. My younger sister finished college, and then I got an honorary degree, so you know, bonus. Oh, you got a They gave you that. I know. Yeah. Oh, dang. Did you even get your GED at all either? Uh, no. I did finish I did finish high school. You did? GD is high school, right? Is that I don't know. I think they make a GD premiere now. I don't know. I don't know. Anyone? No. No. GG's high school equivalent. High school. All right. Thank you. Um I got a real I got a I got a high school diploma. You got a high school diploma? That's my That's my education, dude. That's 94% of our country. So, you're in good hands, brother. You're right there with some of the greats. Um so, when you started when you first started, let me think if I want to think. Oh, where was your first date that you took uh Priscilla to? Do you remember? Yeah, for Priscilla that was uh we went to this place, Berdicks. It was um Berdick. Berdex. La Berdicks. This uh like chocolate place, hot chocolate. Um that was that was pretty good. Um and was it just like you went and sat down or you is it like a restaurant or just a place to get? Yeah, it's like a little coffee place. Little like hot chocolate type coffee place. It's um Yeah. No, it's nice. They they they make good chocolates. They make these little mice things. Oh yeah. Yeah. Chocolate mice. So now every year on our anniversary, we get some mice. Oh yeah. Good deal. Oh yeah. Nothing like a couple of tech emperors are enjoying a couple of mice. You feel me? I think that's very normal. That's very normal to me, dude. Um sorry that just made me laugh, dude. I'm sorry, Mark. That just made me freaking laugh. It's just crazy to think. Well, chocolate mice. Yes, chocolate mice. Yeah. And that Yeah. And we'll put that in the notes in the notes. Um Yeah. No, it's not I I feel like when you go like full Roman Empire, it's like give me give me the live mice. Give me the live mice. And then one mouse shows up and he has like a bad leg. You're like all of them fully alive. Dude, if somebody sees a mouse with a bad leg, nobody even cares. That's the saddest thing about some mice. But actually, I used to sell hamsters. My first job was selling hamsters growing up. And um a lot of that market, they brought in these Russian hamsters, right? And it took away a lot of the American market. And the Russian ones, they're called like the Robaravskis. Bring up a couple of Robarovskies, man. They were uh they they they took away like the fluffy kind of American hemp and they I mean they're pretty cute. They are cute, but the ones that we were getting a lot of them were from Russia. Put from Russia. Put uh Robarovski hamsters from Russia. Uh were the small white ones with kind of the red eyes. Yeah, they they really I think they um they put some visual effects on some of their eyes. There you go. These were really not helping people feel good. Yeah. No, that's like that's like a vampire. It was a little bit much. It was a lot for some of the children. Uh you know, so one of my daughters is really into hedgehogs. So we we found um we're in like we took them to Japan and there's this hedgehog cafe that you can just go in and they can just like play with the hedgehog. I've never seen a hedgehog. Yeah. No, it's it's uh they're pretty cute. It's kind of looks like that but less red eyes. But um Yeah. No, Bay. Yeah, she's out there. Those are beautiful. No, those the the idea of cafes where you can hang out with animals. Mhm. Um, and Priscilla was telling me that she took the kids to this cat cafe and like it's like my daughter was like hanging out with the cats and it was like couldn't find a cat that she liked and then like finally found a cat that she was into and then like find just as she was sitting down like hang out with the cat. Someone came in and was like up this cat has been adopted and took oh just like that issue that's going on with that guy they deported to El Salvador right now. That sounds like very I don't know if it's similar to that, but it sounds like there's like a lot that seems completely different. Absolutely. A completely different thing. You're right. That's um Yeah, you're right. It's not the same fairy tale. I don't know how the either one of those fairy tale ends, but that's so sad. The cat at least got a home. Yeah, the cat got a home. And this I think that guy will get home. I don't know a lot about it. It just like spawned me on that. That could be something like that. Um do you you have how many do you have a three daughters? Three daughters. And you had three sisters. I did. Yeah. So you're kind of surrounded by girls. God. Yeah. And did you what's it like like bedtime with your daughters at night? Like what is that like at at the Zuckerberg's home? Um yeah. I mean it's just it's like so because I'm so busy during the day. I try to make it so that like the time that I know I'm going to hang out with the kids at night. I try to spend like half an hour with each of them at night. And and they're different ages. So we got like a nine, a seven-year-old, a 2-year-old. Oh wow. That's fun. Um yeah. So bedtime I don't No, I mean the kids are all crazy in different ways and and we just kind of like try to connect with them on on whatever they want. Um like what do they like to if it's not No, the 2-year-old is just like starting to learn how to speak and she probably code which would have been crazy. Yeah. No. Well, well, she's like Yeah. Now the 2-year-old has very strong opinions and I think it's going to be very interesting. Really? Um Yeah. Um Yeah. But it's like, let let me let me think about what I mean, she's um I don't know. I need to let me think about something funny that she's doing. But while um while I'm thinking about that, the uh the seven-year-old is just like purely generative, constantly just creating things. Um you know, she's the one who's like, \"We'll do like 3D printing. She'll create like 3D worlds in this like Horizon metaverse system that we're building. Um, she codes, she writes books, she um, she basically like makes music. Um, she is she's seven years old. She's seven. Yeah. Seeing her has really like I think helped me understand myself in a way because it's like it's kind of like okay like why do I just keep like building stuff? Like why do I care so much about creating stuff? And it's like I don't know. I think some people just like have a thing in them where it's like they have to create stuff like the stuff just like comes out of them. They're constantly generating things and like and and kind of producing stuff and and you notice that in her. She's like that. Yeah. Yeah. I think Yeah. I mean I think before before kind of she started growing up and doing that Priscilla was just like why don't you just like relax, right? It's like you've done you've built enough things, right? It's like your company is good. Like you can just chill. And and now now I think after seeing um this one, she's just like, \"Okay, no, I get it. Yeah, you you have the same thing. You have what she has, right? It's like you're just constantly creating stuff.\" She's like, \"Dude, yeah, you're Thomas medicine.\" There you go. There you go. Pretty good. I like that. Yeah. No, it's uh Yeah. Thank you, dude. Um every now and then, you know, our oldest daughter is just like is The oldest one is nine, you said? Yeah, she's nine. And Okay, so that's getting up there a little bit in eight. So, she's getting into like the zone where she's like she competes. She's doing like history B and like competing in math and um and really wants to like understand the world. So, um so my my activities with her is like we'll usually like go through the news and I'll find she'll find like one thing, we'll pick out a story and then we'll just like talk about it. And it's it's really interesting because like it hadn't occurred to me before how much in order to understand like technology you need to really understand like government and civics and politics and law and like all of these different things. So trying to explain to like a child who hasn't thought much about these things um is it's both very fascinating for for me. Um, but it's just been like a cool bonding experience of like every and you you start off and it's like a really basic understanding, but then after you've done it for like a year or two that like, okay, she has like a very good understanding of like the tech industry and the world and all this stuff. And it's it's um it's pretty interesting to to talk through. Well, I think it's inspiring just to even parents to hear like what can you talk to your kid about? You know what I'm saying? Like if your kid's 13 and you're still reading in Baron St. Bears or whatever, some of that's on you. like you got to evolve some of the curriculum for your child, you know. Um because yeah, a lot of parents think you probably can't kind of build these worlds in a child's head, but if you start with the basic blocks, then you kind of can, you know, and help them uh get bigger ideas about things. I think that's cool. I think there's nothing more important than how a parent communicates with their child, you know, and what they communicate to them because so often we just expect like teachers and different curriculum out in the world or just the world to do that for our children. But man, I think the the biggest faucet for a child is the is the parent, you know. Um that's pretty cool. And the little one is just a little just two. We got we got a we got a bonus. Yeah. So it's um No, she's she's good. But I mean obviously very she's just obsessed with her older sisters. Like so one day she just decided like I am not a baby. And we're like oh you're the family baby. I'm I'm a big girl. It's like that's like a core part of her identity is she's a big girl. She's like, \"Email me now.\" Yeah. No, it's like um yeah, email me now. Email me at sucker baby at Meta. Meanwhile, she can't even like fully pronounce it. She goes, \"I'm a bit girl.\" It's like, \"Okay.\" It's like, \"Well, maybe learn how to pronounce it first and then I'll believe you.\" But um but uh No, she's she's like, \"I weigh six terabytes, you know, like calm down, you know.\" Yeah. No, she's um so funny being like a like a and the stuff that we do it's like I mean it's too you're trying to like teach them like basic stuff. So it's like we have this book it's like how do I feel right? It's just like pictures of other kids and like their facial expressions and it's like the only emotion that she identifies with is happy. And so she'll be having like a terrible meltdown and like sobbing and I'm like Oreo how how do you feel? just goes happy and it's like no you don't have to you don't have to say happy all the time. It's like it's normal like in life it's like we have all these different emotions like you like it's it's important to understand when you're sad or or like angry or frustrated or something but but that's hilarious. So we're still working on that. We're working on we're we're still in the remedial emotional um emotions phase. She'll be like crying like how do you but she knows that's the world. She's like she knows. Yeah. No, it's like Oreo is her name. Aurelia, but we call her Oreo, which I'm sure we're going to regret when um when uh when she's older. Well, it's cute. I think Oreo probably marry a basketball player, I'm guessing. Who knows, Mark? Who knows what'll happen? It could go, you know, Oreo Zuckerberg. Dude, that's when you take um that's when you like that's when you get into the food industry. Oreo Zuckerberg. I don't know. She's she she I think could be Sugar Empress. Well, Menllo Park. Kids love like you know kids love like they go through a phase where they love cleaning and they love like playing cooking, right? It's like oh just give me some like like a pan or like I don't know if that's something I think I think a lot of kids are like that. Yeah. She's just like, \"Give me a desk. Like I want like I want to work like dad does. Like give me a desk and like like I don't want to do this like cooking [ __ ] Like it's like she's like we want to own a Popeye's and she's like but at least she has But I like that though when she has like a you know. No, she's she's a bit girl. Yeah. I like that. I love that idea that some child somewhere. This is going to make my day so much better. Just knowing that a child is just there's a child behind a desk just like demanding. It's like like Yeah. Yeah. There's not enough bandwidth in this crib. Not enough bandwidth to the crib. Yeah. To pull off what I need to pull off. Um I know the kids, you know, I don't Is it fun being a dad? Do you feel like you enjoy it? Does it feel kind of Is it tough to connect with your children? Does that ever feel like a thing as a dad with girl daughters with or with Yeah, I I don't know. I think it's like there's probably some things that they connect better with with mother about, but like but I feel like there's also like I don't know there's all these weird dynamics. I know there's some things that they like probably just connect with me better about where it's, you know, it's it's just a different dynamic with with um father, right? So, and what do they call you? Do they call you dad, father, mother? Dad. Although sometimes they're they're being disobedient, Mark. And it's like, no, dad is a dad is a title. A title, an honorific title that I've earned. Um, Mark, they're like, what is going on? It's like, Oreo, that is [ __ ] Get back in your crib. Um, I'll see you in court. These diapers are too tight. Tell my lawyer. That's hilarious. Um, that's crazy. I think like it's just good for them to to have good role models, right? You know, part of the way that I I feel like when kids grow up, they either end up wanting to like marry people who are the opposite of their parents if it was a bad experience or people who they like think of as sort of like, oh, this was a good role model, right? And so I feel like as long as they look up to us, that's like that's kind of the the that's that's you want to like set a good example, right? So, um but I don't know. I I kind of for me, we talked about this a little bit with um with the fighting stuff early on, but for me it's always just been important that it's like I don't just want to like be a person who like sits and works all the time. I think like you know it's we're not like meant to just sit at a desk all day long and one day Oreo will learn that. Um but um you know I think like a lot of life is like you move around you like you know it's like we're like meant to be active and and do stuff and I think that that's a big part of it. I try to like it's important to me that that the kids get that too and and the kids are very active. Um do your kids have a lot of um like screen time? Like how much screen time do you allow your kids? Yeah. Um it's different for the different ones. We don't just like let them do whatever, but I actually like want them to be fluent with this stuff and like kind of like we talked about earlier. Um you know, I want them to learn how to code, how to use technology. Um I think it's important because a lot of socialization, you know, obviously like happens online at this point. Like people need to get used to the norms and stuff around that. So, I mean, they're not on they're still too young to be using like social media, but uh but they have messenger kids, you know, we we um make it so that they can video chat and and chat with their friends and you know, we'll we'll obviously monitor to make sure that they're um that they're just connecting with the people who who we think that they should. But like I think it's actually good. I think people need to kind of grow up. um I don't need to is strong, but I I I think is um I think it's good if you have an engaged parent and and they um and and as a child you learn up you you you kind of grow up um learning how to use a bunch of this stuff. So I think that that's I think that's all good. I I want the kids um to the extent that they're interested in it to learn how to code, learn how to create stuff, whether it's in like Horizon or VR tools or they play, you know, Roblox and Minecraft and stuff like that. I think that's good. And then, you know, there's a lot of educational study type tools that um you know, when um when our daughter's studying for her competitions or whatever, she can she can kind of uh make a lot of progress on that. So, I I think that that stuff is good, but we're not just like letting them um just kind of sit and watch stuff all day long. So, you think unless you're on a plane, then you do whatever you need to do to get through that flight. Yeah. Thank you, dude. Somebody else needs to say that. Yeah. No, it's Where's the I want to When do we come out with that pacifier that really shuts these kids down for a couple hours? I'm not saying there has to be anything crazy. Nothing illegal, but we need we need a high voltage pacifier back in society, Mark. Oh, man. Um, give us something, brother. Yeah, these kids are screaming. They they sometimes do. I The craziest thing happened to me. One time I'm on a plane, I'm dreaming, right? And I'm like, man, I'm really having some nice dreams. Because I never have good sleep or anything. So, every now and then I come to the surface of my dreams and I'm like, wow, I'm still dreaming. And I go back underwater. Um, but I heard a ukulele playing, right? Ukulele. And at some point I wake up and there is a effing child or child as some people call them playing a ukulele with his parents on this plane. I walked up and I put my hand on it in front of the parents. I think I was still groggy from being asleep and I was like, \"We can't do this today.\" It's like the ukuleles. It's uh it's uh it's a lot. It's time out for ukulele. Yeah. We're shutting down this little hand Hawaii you got going on right here. I mean it probably took a lot of restraint to not just pick up the ukulele and smash it. It really did. Yeah. I mean it's Yeah, it really did. So I just said we're not doing this today in a tone that was that seems seems stern for a child but um especially for a child who you is not your child who who you don't know. I very type of thing that you could cause a scene. I got lucky. The parents were They agreed. They were probably pissed about the ukulele, too. They were afraid to tell their kids something. Yeah. It's like, so you did them a favor. Yeah. It's like, \"Hey, Oreo, sometimes business is closed.\" Yeah. It's like working hours are over for today. Okay. Well, you'll be back in the office tomorrow. Like, sometimes you just have to, you know, but sometimes. So, I agree. Please do whatever you can to stop these kids um from being on planes or screaming on planes because we are looking that's one thing we are all looking to you for. Well, maybe one day we'll deliver that. Nobody needs help spending their money. Sometimes it feels like the whole world is just trying to spend your money. We're going to spend your money.

I I do think a future version of the glasses will get there. I I think you had a chance to to play around with this a bit, but it's um Are those the ones you have on right now or no? Um, no, this is sort of I mean these are the ones that are available today. These are like REI glasses. So, I mean it's you know the they're glasses they can um you know the the main thing is they can um you can take photos or videos with them. Um I love just using them for listening to music um and taking phone calls on them because your ears are open, right? So it doesn't like it doesn't obscure your ability to hear anything else. Um the audio quality is really good, right? because it has a microphone like it's a contact mic um that's like basically in the nose pad. So when I'm Yeah. So when I'm like you can be on a plane and take a phone call and like the other person on the other side can't even hear that you're on a plane. Like it's just like the you can be in a wind tunnel and it's just like whatever. It's the the sound quality is is amazing. But then the main thing is um they're AI glasses. So you can glasses I think are like the perfect form factor for a device where if you want to have an AI that you let see what you see, hear what you hear, it can talk to you, you can talk to it throughout the day. Um, and glasses is that's like, you know, yeah, if you want to have something that has the same context of the world that you do, that's it's going to be glasses. And there's like there's like a billion or two billion people in the world who wear glasses already. M so to me the you know the chance that we look back like a decade from now and like all those glasses aren't AI glasses by that period. It's kind of like like obviously all the flip phones were going to become smartphones, right? I mean that like that was clearly a thing that was going to happen. I think that's going to happen with um with glasses too. But the um the other piece of this is that you're going to get the ability to kind of put holograms in the world, right? So our our experience with technology today is um I don't know it's kind of funny in a way how it's divided where it's like you you know we have the physical world all around us and then if you want to interact with something digital you need to like put a screen up right so maybe it's like this you know you have your your small glowing rectangle your phone with you you know you you have like you know your screen if you want to like project something yeah your computer but I I think in the not too distant future this should be blended together right you'll like the physical world, but all this digital stuff should just basically be holograms. You shouldn't need like a physical screen. Um like there's no reason why in the future, you know, you want to have a screen there. You'll just have glasses and that screen will be a hologram, right? And that's what you that's what you put me in. Yeah. Somebody put me in it. Yeah. Yeah. That's final season of Stranger Things back there. I got put in whatever they put on me. It was like Lens Crafters makes lens crafters look pretty, you know, lame. Well, it's um it's different. It's It was Well, it was crazy. I'll say it was like Can I say what happened on? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was So, they put it You put the glasses on and they're they're It's like an advancement of the pair that you have on now, right? So, it's like years down the line. How many years down the line do you realistically think that those could um I'm hoping that we'll have a version of that as a product in a few years, but it's going four years or eight years. Hopefully closer to four um or even less, but um but it's I think that there will still be simpler glasses like this and then there will be more complex glasses. Those will be more expensive. There's more technology kind of. Yeah. But so some people will want like more tech. They'll want the holograms. Some people just want a simple experience where it's like, \"All right, I got the AI. I got the ability to listen to music and phone calls and and do all that.\" Um, and then obviously the less tech that you put into them, the thinner they can be, which I mean some people like bulky glasses, some people want thin glasses. And um, yeah, it was fascinating. Yeah. Yeah. They had a a thing on my wrist, right? Uhhuh. Uh, neural interface. A neural interface. Yeah. I mean, you could basically control the glasses with your mind through signals that you're sending from your brain to your hand. Yes, it was fascinating. It was like I could like um touch different nodules if I needed to and stuff or different nodes, whatever it's called. I could look at certain things and that would highlight what it was and it was like a it was just a screen in midair and I could walk around the side of the room and then come back and the screen would still be there, but it wasn't really there in real life. It was just there with the glasses on. Yeah, it's a hologram. Yes. And it was it was crazy, man. I don't know. And then I was like, well, my first thought was like, well, how do you just get people to adapt to this? Cuz people aren't just going to go from where we are right now to adapt. And then I realized, okay, there's different stair steps. There's like almost like when you got the first smartphone, like you're saying, and then it advance or the first mobile phone and then you have the first metaglasses and then it advances and stuff like that. So, it was fascinating. There was a part where me and another man who I just met him and we played ping pong and I believe it was an Asian guy and I don't know if they did that on purpose or not and I don't know if ping pong is Asian but it's people think it is and I started playing with this man back there, you know, and the table. Huh? Did you win, dude? Who knows? We're in the future. I don't know if they keep score. I think everybody gets a medal. No, you definitely keep score. Oh, you do? Yeah. Yeah. And then in our future, not everyone gets a medal. Yeah. I like that. Are you not? It's like Yeah. No, that's that's more Yeah. Oreo, fire up the grill. Yeah. Loser burns. But no, um the uh but that we could play a game of And it was a not real. It was a ping pong table in front of us that was not real. It was like 3D ping pong there. Yeah. So it wasn't that it wasn't there. Uhhuh. Someone could ride their bike through like your dumb brother could ride his freaking bike. Like dang it. Yeah, Ricky, bro, you freaking rode right through our net. So, I mean, I think it's an interesting thought experiment. How many of the things that we physically have aren't going to need to be there in the future, right? So, pretty much every screen doesn't need to be there, right? It'll just be a hologram. Um, any media, any book that you're playing, any board game, cards, those are that would be nice cuz one thing I hate is at the airport all these TVs are on our air. It's like everything is so loud now. It's like, can you just make it for you? Turn it down. Every Why do we all have to experience this? Yeah. Know, exactly. Painful noise sometimes. Yeah. It's like you're driving through a a city and there's billboards and nothing is personalized. It's like how TV used to be, right? I mean, in the in the future, you know, now like all the stuff that you use on your phone, it's like you get exactly what you're interested in and it's just a much more much higher quality experience, but that there's all this physical stuff that just stuck, right? and and is static and um yeah I mean everything I think is going to be able to um sorry not not everything but but it's I think it's an interesting thought experiment how much of the stuff that we physically have today that just doesn't actually need to exist in the future. Um so do you think um is social media bad? I mean I don't think so but yeah maybe that's not the right term. Um like at a certain point does Yeah. Like how much you know there's been like studies done where it's like doom scrolling and stuff like that can lead to depression that sort of thing. Like do you Yeah. What do you think about that? Like Yeah. So so look I mean we obviously study this stuff pretty carefully. Um you guys do? Yeah. I mean we study it. We work with academics to study it. Um, you know, as you can imagine, there's a lot of like media coverage of this stuff that's like very um sensationalist that tries to like have a skewed point of view. My understanding of the current state of the research is that there isn't kind of a conclusive um finding that this is negative for people's well-being. So, I I think that that's and in general, you know, some of the stuff that ends up being positive for people is is building relationships. So there's sort of the media part of social media and there's the social part of social media. I think the the interacting with people um to the extent that that's helping you build good relationships. I mean friendships and good relationships is one of the things that correlates the most strongly with positive well-being and like feeling good about your life and all that. The media stuff, I mean, I think that's more entertaining. You know, I think you can, you know, people want things that are fun, right? Yeah. people want to be entertained for sure necessarily like correlate with good well-being or bad well-being but I guess like the way that I think about this stuff is that it's um our modern online environment is um it it's just an environment in which we live in a way that has pros and cons like whether you live in a city or a rural place right it's like okay like some people may prefer living in a city. There's like things that are good about a city. There are things that are bad about a city. Okay? Like the fact that we went from being primarily offline as a society to now like this kind of hybrid kind of physical and digital reality. There's some things that are better about that, some things that are that are maybe less good. Um it's not that every single thing improves at each step along the way, but I think overall um it's it's um kind of the overall effect is significant improvement. And I I just don't see a way that people would want to like go back to not having services where they can get the content that they're interested in and where stuff is personalized to them and where they can communicate with the people who they want and don't need to like be constrained to just the people who are physically around them. It's just I mean like we're just you know we're not going back to that. And if you look throughout history, it's like when people like first built cities, you know, there were all these um there's a lot of kind of nostalgia for the the simpler life and things like that. It's like, okay, yeah, and and yeah, sure, maybe maybe cities aren't better in every single way, and some people might prefer to kind of only go sometimes or whatever, but but I I I just think it's like we're we're building more and more capabilities as society. And I think that that's sort of I just think about this stuff more as like an environment in which we live. So then it's more like if Yeah. Like some I think like cuz I've been thinking a lot about this. I think a lot of people have. It's like well we're moving into such a like technology is advancing so much faster, right? It's accelerating the advancement speed and then we're just humans and we're in this the space now where there's like one generation to the next where one generation was completely grown up online and one hasn't really. Um yeah. So I wonder and I think the older generation probably sees it as like man this is so negative everybody's stuck but I wonder if the younger generation do they even know any different right you know like just I start to wonder what is the value of being human like like what is the does that start to dissipate as we become more technologically advanced or does that alter like do you think about that sometimes yeah I mean look I think it's going to give people the freedom to focus more on the things that they want. I I think if you look at the arc of of history, go back like I mean before you know in ancient times life was like pretty brutal, right? It's like okay. So then then you go to like maybe right before the industrial revolution where they had team toilet paper at one time they had like group toilet paper and it was like Yeah. That's I mean that's not good. That's not good. Yeah. And I don't think I mean I don't you don't want to Yeah. No, it's I I think anyone who has nostalgia for the past really is not taking into account the disease and the lack of hygiene that existed in the past. So I think that there's is So anyway, but pre-industrial revolution, I think some huge percent of the population was farmers because basically everyone needed to be focused on growing things in order to have enough food. Then we basically got to the point where okay, now we can start to produce food much more efficiently. So that actually frees up a lot of people to not have to be farmers. Now maybe like 2% of people can be farmers and 98% of people can do other stuff. So now we people start doing more kind of other creative stuff and inventing new things and um and at each step along the way uh kind of like being a farmer is a really hard job, right? It's like you're working like a lot of hours and and and and now as as kind of people got more options, they they took other jobs. Um but then we've also seen this mix where the percent of people's time that has gone towards leisure and entertainment has just steadily increased over time. Um and I just think that that's going to continue to be the case with technology. We'll have more stuff that will make it so that the basic needs um are taken care of, which will free people up to do some combination of more creative jobs and not have to work as hard if they don't want to. But I think some people are going to like working all the time like me and um and you'll be able to do that too and get more done than you could have ever possibly done in the past. Um but that'll be sort of a choice. And well since you're kind of like a leader in innovation and technology in our world, you know, um do you how do you know that what your convictions are how do you gauge if what your convictions are are the best for everybody kind of like how do you kind of figure that out? You know, it seems like such a challenge. Yeah. Well, does that make sense to the question or No. No. Yeah. No, I I think I get what you're asking. Um, I mean, look, at the end of the day, um, there are still a lot of options of things that people can do. Just because I build something doesn't mean that people are going to use it. Actually, a lot of the things that I build, like some some of them work, some of them don't. And like, I think part of the reason why the company's been successful is because, you know, maybe we have a slightly higher hit rate of things working than others. But it's kind of like I don't know in baseball it's like most people don't get on base most of the time, right? It's so it's it's like like running one of these companies you you more of the stuff doesn't work than does. And if we do something that doesn't work then in general people aren't going to use it and then the future doesn't go in that direction. So I see. So you're saying it's up to the user more. Yeah. I mean, look, I I I kind of think um one way to look at the world is that there there's a version of history that says that like individual people are very powerful and have a lot of kind of autonomy and ability to to kind of go in the direction that they think is right. And then there's like all these other narratives where people try to kind of diminish people's autonomy and authority. And I I'm just like I've always been a person who really kind of believes that people understand people are smarter than people think. Um Yes. And and I think in general um are able to make good decisions for their lives and when they do things that like the media or whatever thinks don't make sense, it's generally because the media doesn't understand their life, not because the people are stupid. Um like if people are saying something that seems wrong, it's not usually misinformation. And it's usually that you don't understand what's going on in that person's life. And I I just think that there's like a certain kind of paternalism in in some of the like mainstream narratives and some of the media narratives, but like a know-it-allism almost. Yeah. It's like I there has been for sure for years. I think it's starting to change more. Yeah. I think it's a little more receptive as as maybe some of those cultural or media elite people like are having a harder time predicting what's going to happen in the world. Maybe there's a little more humility of like, okay, maybe we don't understand all of this. But but to me, the best predicting thing has always been like, all right, if you build something, do people actually think it's good? Because like at some level, you know, it's like I just believe that people are actually very smart and understand their lives very well. And if you're building something that is useful for them, then they will use it. And if you're using something and if you're building something that is not useful for them, then they have other options. They will they will do something else. Um, and so I don't know, it's always served me well to generally have faith in people and believe that people are smart and can make good decisions for themselves. And whenever we try to like adopt some sort of like attitude of, oh, we must know better than them. It's like we're like we're the people building technology, that's when you lose, right? Right. And if you do and if you have that attitude for long enough, then you just like become a shitty company and you lose and you lose and you lose and then you're irrelevant. So, um, so I I I tend to just think that at the end of the day, yeah, I mean, I think people are smarter than than a lot of people think and I think ultimately drive the direction that society goes in. you um so like people a lot of times like there's guys who are like kind of you know Elon Musk is probably like a socially awkward guy and I would say that I mean I think that's we all are right we all are right I think we all are and it's interesting that there's like probably people have I mean have you ever felt socially awkward over your years no I'm I'm I'm really smooth no obviously yes I'm like the most awkward person people have been calling me a robot bought online for 20 years. It does wonders for my confidence. No, your confidence cannot be impaled. I don't think that's one thing you have that's probably a a sheer northstar inside of you. It's got to be Well, you might have become bulletproof. I think there's times where Yeah, you seem like a guy who probably like like watched a video of how to be a guy on YouTube or something, you know? But I think we all we all go through like we're all like awkward in different ways, you know? you put you in certain environments you're not at all. I But I think it's interesting that there's I haven't found those environments yet. But maybe, you know, it's dude, even being here today, bro, is nice of you. It's nice of you to be here today. No, I I think the podcasts are awesome because you're just like you get to explore something, right? For sure. But here's my question. Sorry, Mark. I don't mean to interrupt you, but I'm not going to get another chance to. So my question is, is it interesting that they have kind of people who have would probably self-describe as socially awkward at times kind of creating technology that socially connects people? That's the thing that do you ever kind of find that kind of fascinating? Cuz I've always had a belief that that that like sometimes socially awkward people are almost a mix between human and like mach like like the future or something. Does that make any sense to you? Yeah, you know, I it's an interesting question. I I I just think that there are a bunch of factors here that you need to peel apart. Um I think someone can be socially perceptive and understand kind of what is going on in social dynamics and have a lot of empathy and care about other people while still being quite awkward. in how they communicate and um and so I I don't think you can build a great Yeah. I'm trying to build too broad of a bridge. No. Well, I I think it's a fair point, right? I mean, it's like, all right, a lot of social media is like people creating great content and um and kind of communicating really well. And those are not my biggest strengths, right? It's like I'm I'm I don't think I'm the best communicator by a long shot. I mean, I think I kind of got to where I am because I I I think I kind of understand what people like and I have the ability to build it, but I I don't think my strength is like, oh, I can really like communicate about why what I'm building is awesome. I I generally like to like to make it my work speaks for itself. and I try to explain it so I can kind of explain how I'm thinking about it, but but I don't think people primarily like using our stuff because, you know, they saw me talk about it and they're like, \"Oh, yeah, this seems super exciting now.\" Um, but but I think the ability to kind of communicate in a way that is not awkward is a different skill um than the ability to kind of understand and have empathy for for kind of people and and social interactions. And it's, you know, there's an interesting thing where I actually think sometimes a lot of the people who can communicate in the smoothest way sometimes have a lot less empathy and understanding of social dynamics than the kind of nerdy guy who may not be able to express himself quite as well, but sort of understands a little bit better what's going on. Um, and I don't know, the world's complicated and there's like multiple dimensions to all this stuff and no one's good at all of them. So, you just, you know, try to do the things that you're you like hone the things that you're good at and try to put it to service to, you know, do as good of work as you can. Yeah. I think we're in this unique place where I believe it's like one or two generations think that one something isn't social and then the younger generation thinks that it is social. Yeah. And so I feel like in some senses we're at this crossroads kind of of like how we communicate as humans a little bit um and this advancement and sometimes those steps are uh are kind of tricky to take. Um this is my last question cuz I know you have to go. Um so I feel like Elon Musk has like a like he wants to get on Mars and he wants to like impregnate different planets or whatever, you know, or whatever he's doing, dude. He's just blasting his seat out into the different rockets, whatever, you know? He's just out there, you know, he's like the Johnny Apple solar system, you know, but God bless. But no, God bless 100%, dude. And yeah, 100%. Um, and I'm just joking. He I think he probably would know that, but um I I just think it's interesting like you get his you get what his ideas are. He wants to like we want to be on Mars and we want to send the rockets and we want to make everything solar powered and stuff and you're such an innovator and a leader. like what is what do you feel like is your kind of it's not a goal but kind of where do you what do you what draw like what is the thing where you see us you know like where you're at a point where like man this is what I'm really proud of and this is where I see us going because you know we're all on this bus together going somewhere and we don't exactly know where we're going because it's the future. Yeah. But you're kind of you're kind of one of the guys driving the bus you know at least riding shotgun. So, it's like where are we going? I I mean, I think different people just care about about uh different parts of of uh the future, right? So, the space thing, I think it's cool. I'm glad that people are working on it. It's never really been my my main thing. Um, for me it's all it's it's kind of been about the intersection of of how do you build technology that helps people connect with each other and understand the world better and um and just taken different formats over time, right? So, you got started people you know mostly like you know writing text then you know then we got smartphones and um we got cameras with the smartphones. We started taking a lot of photos and sharing that. And now now most of what we do is video, right? The mobile networks are are good enough that you can like share great video. It used to be great. Yeah. 10 years ago you try watching a video, it's like buffering buffering. It's like, okay, this is this is terrible. But now now it's good. Um people always want to both kind of express their ideas and experience other people's ideas in whatever the richest format is that they can. So, if that was going to be text, then that was the best that they had. Great. Photos, visual, great. A picture's worth a thousand words. Video better than photo for most things. But I don't think that's the end of the line, right? I just think um we're going to be here, whether it's 5 years or 10 years. And I think the ability to like fully capture moments um to really be able to experience them. I think that's sort of the hologram thing that we're talking about. Um, I think that that's just going to be like the next level of um of people being able to express like ideas. Yeah. Like the next like blank canvas. So, I think that's one thing. And then there's the whole AI thing which we haven't spent time on. But we should we should um which that is really going to um give people a lot of new tools to to kind of um both just get smarter at everything they do. And um and if you look at the world like I do through this lens of how do we express ourselves and how do we kind of take in an understanding of what's going on, AI is just going to be super powerful for for both of those. It's um I mean you can already see some of the basic stuff with like people creating images or it's unbelievable. I mean it's crazy how fast it's happening too. That's what I'm amazed at is just how fast it's happening. Yeah. But do you think like do you envision this like are you just like like what do you envision that will be on these like surf do you have like kind of like a utopian idea or do like I just wonder how do you see things cuz you're the only like you're probably one of the smartest people to ever use thought. I don't know. I don't know. Well that we you know you're one of the most unique people to ever use thought that we have in our time. So, it's like how do you what is it what is it like out there? I I mean I I think that we're going to get general intelligence. Um we're going to have systems that are smarter than um than any individual. And I think it's mostly going to be very empowering for people f first of all look I mean there are already systems that are smarter than any one individual today right if you take like a company right it's like okay you got like a thousand people or 10,000 people who are all kind of like working towards you know ostensibly working towards a goal together like I you know if the intelligence of a 10,000 person company is not greater than the intelligence of a single person and like what are we doing here right so there are already these systems in the world that have this sort of super intelligence that is far exceeds what any one person can do. And I I just think like instead of having relatively few people be able to kind of harness the power of like you have the ability of you know you have a 10,000 person organization that can um that can help you build the things that you think are good. I just think in the future almost everyone is going to have that and that's cool. What does that mean? It means that more ideas are going to get tried out. Um, so we might be up like leveling up in an overall idea of creativity in the universe with AI. Yeah. And and I think it's going to be every field, right? So like science will get more advanced. Um, like we'll get more productive, but like I think a big part of the internet is stuff just gets more fun and funnier and like the memes get weirder and more specific and like that is advancement too, right? It's almost like universal basic technology kind of in a way. Yeah. just the the ability to to kind of express these like very complicated ideas in like a very simple piece of media. I I think we're going to get better and better at that and that advances our kind of understanding of ourselves as a society. So, um yeah, I don't know. I I I think we'll get super intelligence and I would guess that it will be um a continuation of this trend that humanity has been on for a hundred plus years of basically getting more time to do creative things, less time having to do drudgery, not having to spend as much time working if you don't want, but if you want to uh dedicate your life towards that, you're going to have more powerful tools than you could ever have possibly imagined. So, it's not as much a conviction as much as it is a space of choice is how you see that. Like just kind of that sort of thing. What do you mean? It's not like you're like like convicted to this sort of like future as we advance. Like it's just a space of choice. If you still want to be able to do these things, you can do those. And if you want to be able to do these things, you can do those. There you are on the bus right there. There you go. I mean, that's a little weird of a photo, but I do not think that is good. I do not think that is good. Um I don't like that at all. And we thank you for telling us that though. Horrible AI. Yeah, I think that was open AI, dude. So, sorry about that. Um, do you think you do you think you'll live forever, Mark? Is that a thought coming to your head, man? Um, that is an interesting question. I I think you have two minutes to answer then you have to leave. Yeah. No, I I don't know. Live forever. Gosh, I I think at some point we will like a lot of Well, let me come at it this way. our um outside of meta um my the philanthropy that I do with with Priscilla the Chan Zuckerberg initiative is primarily focused on curing diseases and the way we're doing that is not by focusing on any single disease it's by focused on kind of basic technology at the intersection of AI and biology to accelerate the pace of science and we originally thought that kind of a hundred years when we started was sort of around the time frame to be able to cure and prevent and like deal with all diseases. I think there's a chance that that happens sooner than um you know because of because of all the work with with AI. I guess I'm I'm more optimistic about that now. Um whether that means that like we are going to live forever or we just have healthier lives for the period that we're supposed to be living and then at some point like your human body is done. Um I I don't I don't think we understand that yet enough. But um but a lot of curing diseases is not just about living forever. It's about having better lives and and it's like and it's like while you're alive like you don't want to have to deal with [ __ ] right? It's like like where you're just like you feel terrible because you're sick or like you're injured or there's you know. So, do you think it's possible like do you when you because you have an understanding of like science and being human that is that is way supersedes a lot of people's do you um do you think it's possible that we could figure that out curing all diseases uh to be able to like live to keep life like do you think it's possible we could figure out how to do it I think it's possible um I I don't know it's honestly it's not an area that I've studied that much and it's um you didn't know because we don't know we don't know what's going on Mark and we just want you to tell us yeah I mean No, I don't know. I don't know. I Let's Let's check back in in 10 years on that. I think that as as the the AI stuff makes more progress, I think we'll we'll kind of get a sense of the trajectory for that. But but I I think it's just going to unlock a lot of creativity and productivity and fun. And like I I think people the technology industry misses fun a lot. I think that that's like one observation that I've had building stuff out here is um people are very focused on like all right, we're going to make like a better word processor. We're going to like process information better. Cool. Um, but I don't know. A lot of what people care about is just like, all right, I want to like be entertained. I want like I want my life to be fun, right? I want I want something that's funny that I can then go show to my friends and then we can talk about that and like and then just hang out and have a good time like showing each other funny things and like talking about what the world is. And I think AI is going to make this stuff all great. So, um, I don't know. I mean, it's I I do think this is this is a big a big focus for us and we're building this meta AI. Um, it's our we call it personal AI. I mean, our goal on this is not just to build something that's like I mean, yeah, it's going to be super smart, right? It's it's like, yeah, we're trying to solve full general intelligence and super intelligence and all that, but I think in order to build a product that people are going to want to use, um, you're going to want to build something that's fun to use. That means like you're not just going to want to like type to it. You want to like have a conversation, right? And and it's not just about having it be like only able to answer hard questions. It should like get to know you and like what you think is funny and like what you ate, right? So that way you know it can like or you know what your hobbies are so that way it can kind of relate to you. And um I think people don't know that AI can do that. I think we need we're we're missing quickly I think in education educating people how to what AI is and how to use it. I think I noticed even in my own life and I spend a lot of time online and involved in stuff but I think people are not understanding what's going on. So I don't know how we get people educated quickly so that they can I think whoever can also serve people the best way to educate themselves is going to be able to best exert um or um be able to best uh coagulate people to their AI um model or whatever. heard coagulate used that way or Yeah. or something like that because that's the big thing. A lot of people are like, \"We have the best eye.\" But most people are like, \"What the hell is what are we doing?\" You know what I'm saying? Yeah. So, anyway, sorry. I think I kept you longer than we were supposed to, but um yeah, sorry we got on a lot of technological stuff. I think it's just kind of like, you know, we don't know what's happening and sometimes we want to talk, we get to talk to somebody like you and it's important, you know. Yeah. No, it's good. This is a fun conversation. Yeah, man. I enjoyed it, too, man. Um Yeah. Thanks for sharing just some of what your life is like with us and um just I hope that yeah just keep make sure we stay alive or whatever if we're supposed to and just keep taking working on it. Okay, that's all we can ask for now, sir. Awesome. Mark, thanks. Appreciate it, brother. Yeah. Now I'm just floating on the breeze and I feel I'm falling like these leaves. I must be corner stone. Oh, but when I reach that ground, I'll share this peace of mind I found. I can feel it in my bones. [Music] Also want to say a thank you to the people at Grace Dental. That's Grace Dental in Palo Alto, California. They um glued my tooth was broken and they glued it back together uh before the interview uh today. So, I'm thankful that they helped and I'm grateful that I got to meet them. Thanks,"

      "transcript": "this is a a a space that I mean that there's just going to be a huge amount of leverage with AI. It still seems like there could be a lot more effort in this space around building tools and it's kind of this crazy thing that we're you know here in you know 2025 and there's not the kind of periodic table of elements equivalent for biology. We think that this is like probably one of the most important sets of tools that you need to build. When we first set out that the goal to cure and prevent disease by the end of the century, people like honestly most scientists couldn't look at us with a straight face. And that's crazy. Yes. And it was true because if you just decided to spend the money funding the next best grant for every single lab in the country, like you there was no pathway to that being true. The biology folks, I think, looked at it as if it were crazy ambitious. And then the AI folks are like, well, that's kind of boring. That's just automatically going to happen. I know. It's like, okay, there's something in between there that needs to be bridged. Mark Priscilla, welcome to the Asz podcast. Thanks for having us. Yeah, great to be here. Excited. All right. Excited to have you. You're doing exciting stuff. Yeah. Well, to that end, almost a decade ago, you guys started the Chan Zuckerberg initiative with the mission and intent to cure, prevent, manage all disease by the end of this century. There's a lot of missions that you guys could have poured your time and resources into. Why don't we talk about take us behind the conversations of why you guys picked this one? Maybe Priscilla, why don't we start with with you and you hear your side of the story. It always surprises people when I talk about how we work in basic science research. Um, I trained as a pediatrician and people always think like, oh, it must be about medicine. And for me, it w, you know, I went into medicine because I wanted to improve people's lives. I wanted to make a difference. I wanted to be able to help others. And I think training as a pediatrician at UCSF, I met a lot of patients and frankly like little kids and families for which like we just had no idea what the problem was. and they might have like a specific gene that they could name if they were lucky. Um, or they could be grouped into a bunch of other diseases and there'd be a general sort of PDF they'd print out like this is what we know. And then it was my job as an intern or resident to try to translate like like a few lines of information to how we were supposed to take care of the patient. And for me, that's when I really like realized the power of basic science and how we need to work on basic science to advance the forefront of what's possible and without that there's sort of I think of it as the pipeline of hope. Yeah. And why did you think um you could cure all disease? Because that's like a very like aggressive goal. Um do you want to do you want to answer that one? Yeah. Well, well, I mean we're not going to cure all diseases to be clear. I mean the the strategy is to help scientists and the scientific community cure all diseases. So the strategy is really one of accelerating the pace of basic science and the theory that we had was if you look at the history of science most major breakthroughs are basically preceded by the invention of a new tool to observe phenomena in a new way. Right? So think about things like the microscope, right? Being able to observe bacteria or you know other fields, the telescope or um you know, but it's just to use an engineering example, you know, it's without those kind of tools, it's kind of like you're coding without being able to step through the code and debug things, right? So it's um that's like the old days when you so so our our whole approach on this is basically let's help build tools that will accelerate the pace of the whole field and I think that that there's a niche that I think fits that because if you look at how funding works in science you know the vast majority of funding comes from the government and NIH grants. it's parcled out into these relatively small grants that allow individual investigators to investigate usually pretty near-term things. Um, and the development of these kind of new types of tools, whether it's imaging or building now a lot of AI things like virtual cell models, um, are longer term, often times more expensive to develop. So think about like on the order of a hundred you know maybe you know hundred million to a billion dollars over a um over a 10 to 15 year period and then you you try to unlock those tools and give them to the scientific community to accelerate the pace. So that's that's kind of the the theory right and and there it seems like there's also something that that's is you don't really get credit for the tools in a lot of ways. I mean, we've been noted, well, we have companies that use your tools and they're very happy about it. But, um, you know, I didn't even know that that was the case. And so, that's why it's philanthropy. Yeah. Well, it is, but most people do philanthropy to get credit, too. I mean, you know, like that's a you know, that that's kind of a part of it. So, how did you I guess did you think about that or were you just like, no, like this is going to work and if it works, that's all we need. We're super focused on like actually making every scientist better and and beyond science like startups, startup founders because I the point is we can't do this alone. And when we first set out that the goal to cure and prevent disease by the end of the century, people like honestly most scientists couldn't look at us with a straight face and crazy. Yes. And it was true because if you just decided to spend the money funding the next best grant for every single lab in the country like you there's no pathway to that being true. But if you forced people to really think about this and like okay what is the most credible pathway to doing this and what are the barriers to that credible pathway then we sort of got somewhere right? They were like, well, like there's no shared tools or like we don't have we're not working on big projects and building the right data sets. And we're like, okay, well then we can start doing something about that. Um, and so that's where the idea of building shared tools cuz no one right now in the science. Well, that's so interesting. So basically, you're like, we're going to cure all disease and they're like, yeah, can't be done. Why can't it be done? Well, because we don't have the tools. Okay, that's pretty that's a pretty cool sequence. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's also this funny thing where the the biology folks, I think, looked at it as if it were crazy ambitious. And then the AI folks are like, well, that's kind of boring. That's just automatically going to happen. I know it's like, okay, there's something in between there that needs to be bridged. And if you can like kind of use the the kind of modern AI tools in order to build the types of tools that biologists need. So that's a big part of how we think about our work is um AI has got to be the most overestimated and underestimated technology ever like simultaneously. So weird. I mean, yeah, we'll probably like the internet early on, but but we kind of think about ourselves and the work that we're doing at the Biohub as frontier biology paired with frontier AI, right? So, there's there are labs that do frontier AI that uh basically, you know, are building the most advanced models. Um and then there are lots of biological research organizations that that effectively do very leading edge research to build um you know to either discover new data sets or or or looking to certain challenges. But so far there hasn't been anyone who's tried to do both of those at once. And when you look at I mean even something like AlphaFold which is amazing right it's it was built off of this data set that was a public data set that had been produced decades ago right and um what what I think you have the opportunity to do if you do both of those together is produce specific data sets for the purpose of training AI models to build virtual cells that can do specific things right so I think that that's like a a pretty interesting zone to be in and of all the things that that we've uh that we've worked on. You know, actually when when we started CZI, we we kind of actually focused on a number of areas and what we found is just that the science research has had by far the biggest return. So, we've just doubled down on it over and over and over until now we're at the point that, you know, we're 10 years in and Biohub is really the like main focus of of our of our philanthropy at this point. Um, but yeah, I mean, that's kind of that's basically the focus. Maybe you're not giving yourselves enough credit because you're sort of saying, \"Well, there's bite-size science. We didn't want to do that. There's century scale science and that seemed like a long time horizon, but achievable, ambitious.\" But you've actually identified, you know, which I think is really fantastic, grand scientific challenges that are right in between. They're 10 to 15 year horizons, at least per kind of the way you communicate about them and the way you energize the scientific community about them. 10 to 15 is kind of an interesting time horizon sort of like similar to the time horizon of a venturebacked company similar to the time horizon on which a team can work together for that period of time I think it's how did you get to that number and then how are you thinking about the challenges that you take on in each 10 to 15 year wave because that's concrete achievable you know you build a lot of credibility around it the way that you've announced those challenges well I'm curious how you guys think about it but for us when we looked at the grand challenges for on the 10 to 15 year time horizon it needs to be like when you look at it you're like I see a path right not everything needs to be solved for us to take it on in fact if everything's solved then that feels like that should just go ambitious enough yeah like you like we we have we have some risk appetite right so we want things where we're like there's a credible pathway someone who is at the helm who can do this And there's enough ambiguity where we feel like we could take on that risk and if we do it like the the returns could be higher than even expected and the way we modeled that from you know in the biohubs is we we have three biohubs. We have one in San Francisco, one in Chicago, one in New York. The one in New York works on cell engineering. You know can we engineer cells to go in and detect signals, read it out or to take certain actions. In Chicago, we're building tissues and looking at uh tissue cell communications within tissues. And then in San Francisco, we're looking at deep im imaging and uh transcrytoics. And that work the locations are not by accident. We also look at the partner universities because we have folks who come to the biohubs to do this work collaborative, interdisciplinary um and sort of unconstrained by the traditional lab. But we also build off of the labs at these academic institutes that support the work. And so uh that's how we sort of choose the grand challenge and um and the locations. And then the sort of layering and the uh large language models and AI coming into the picture has been so interesting because we were already building tools to measure interesting data building the data sets but we didn't really know what to do with them yet. Um and large language models coming onto the scene we're like wow we can make sense of all of this now. I'm curious what you view success as in the therapeutic realm. So, you know, we think a lot about understanding biology and sometimes we bet on startups that want to unlock completely new biological areas, diseases where we don't know what's going wrong. And then there's another group of folks who kind of say, hey, okay, now that we understand what's going wrong, let's fix it. Um, let's come in with a drug. Let's come in with a new type of chemistry, a new type of antibbody. How do you what do you think success for the CZ Biohub looks like 10, 20, 50 years from now in terms of the new medicines that you've enabled? We want there to be like an explosion of a community who are building these um just the new wave of what it means to be deploying precision medicine. like we like I think for rare diseases and common diseases alike, you're really talking about individual biology that we sort of lump together. Um and uh they and we often don't know how it happens, right? We know that you have this mutation or the worst nightmare is you have a variant of unknown significance. What does that even mean? The horrible us. Yes. Horrible. And you're like you tell someone you kind of know something but we don't know what it means. But if you look at the way we've been able to look at variants and look at single cell transcrytoics, we're starting to be able to say, okay, this variant actually impacts this set of downstream cells and then we start looking at the proteins that get expressed and how it looks similar or different to what a healthy cell would look like. Then you can start targeting. Okay, like let's look at that as a target. And you both know the specificity of the target you want to build based on the ability the ability to connect mutation to protein expression as well as to be able to predict off target effects. What are the side effects? Because you also know where else that drug will be able to interact with the body. And and so those are rare like and and but I really think most diseases should be thought of as rare diseases because each one of our biology is different and right now we just get lumped right we get lumped based on age demographics ancestry if we're lucky uh to have that level of understanding but truly each one of our biology is different and say like if you look at hypertension or depression like we kind of just go by trial and error and saying like let's just try that drug and see what happens. happens. But what should really happen is being able to precisely and accurately and quickly treat people by looking at individuals biology. We want to enable the basic science and we would be thrilled if people picked up the models that we build to be able to build the diagnostics, the therapeutics that need to come. You've built amazing data sets. I have to say like I mean you may not hear the feedback from the startup community and the pharma community and the R&D community but it's there because you've committed to open source and so people may not be they may not all be writing papers but they are using those tools. Um there's a startup in our portfolio working on idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The name tells you how vexing the disease is. It's idiopathic. We don't know why it happens. The IPF is named that way. And so, you know, he was telling me that he used your cell by gene atlases to look at millions of single cells in patients with disease, without disease, try to pinpoint the fibroblasts, double click on the fibroblasts and their gene expression. It's try to, you know, use that to inform, hey, where could I go after a new drug target in this disease that's fundamentally a strange clump of idiopath, you know, idiopathic um origin. So um I think there's a huge there's a huge group of innovators who are who love the tools, the visualizations, the query systems and really the software approach that you built to making that data incredibly accessible. So cell by gene is like almost an accident though. Tell us more. So do you want to share a little bit about cellene or do you want me to start? Well, I mean, I don't know which part you want to get into, but I mean, but the cell atlas work overall, I mean, it's kind of this crazy thing that we're, you know, here in, you know, 2025 and there's not the kind of periodic table of elements equivalent for biology, right? So, that was sort of a lot of the inspiration of it was all right, how do we both through work that we're going to do in the Biohub and through other grants um be able to pull together and standardize a format where you can have all this data. And when we were starting off, we didn't even necessarily have in mind that we were going to use that to build virtual cell models. I think that's sort of just come into focus as the AI work has advanced, but that's a very exciting thing. We should definitely spend a bunch of time on the virtual cell models, but I'm not sure what you wanted to get into on the cell atlas. Well, the single cell work is was one of our first RFAS 10 years ago we started and we were like, okay, we think this is possible. We actually funded the methodology for it to to standardize how it was going to be done. So that was 10 years ago. And we then were we seated a few labs to start building out that data set. But we were like there are like millions or billions of different cell types and different permutations. Like how are we going to do this? And um especially with like a burgeoning technique. And so we ended up um seating a few groups and they started doing work and then they told us they had a problem. There was a uh there was a bottleneck in their workflow because they couldn't annotate the data fast enough. Um and so we built cell by gene was an annotation tool. That's the original source of this. So we built the annotation tool to make it easy for people to who are doing single cell science to be able to annotate the data. And then we put we put the data that we collected publicly so people could share. But because everyone started using the same annotation tool, everyone was standardized then on the same data formats and then there started being a a community around the tool and they wanted to share back and build the atlas. So now after 10 years there are millions of cells that have been built into this uh shared resource for the entire scientific community. We only funded about 75% of it. Sorry that's wrong. We've only funded 25% of it. 75% came from the broader community saying this is useful and there's an easy way for us to standardize and build the same metadata. That's right. It's like an interesting what you'd call a network effect, right? Yeah. I was going to say it sounds like the internet. Yeah. Come for the annotation, stay for the stay for the virtual cell model. Well, it was very important when we were getting started with the work to have everyone who was doing it have a consistent format. So that way it could be used and portable. And then once that kind of took off as as the way that it would get done, then other people just found it valuable. Yeah. And even relative to prior data bases like GIO and and whatnot, they're just simply not as standardized or QC. Yeah. Control. Yeah. Let's get into virtual cells. One of the the great challenges that the grandchild you would focus on. Um maybe talk about what is the promise or the hope and maybe some of the challenges or where we're at with it. Yeah. I mean, we think that one of this is going to be one of the most important tools at this point is basically building up the kind of hierarchy from proteins to um to just different structures within the cell to whole to like whole like a virtual immune system or different levels of hierarchy. And we think that this is going to end up being like a very important set of tools for people to effectively generate hypotheses for for different science work. um you know even before you get to the point where you're really running full experiments in it you can come up with some um estimate of how that might run um it will be useful for some of the precision medicine type um examples that Priscilla was talking about a few minutes ago but we think that this is like probably one of the most important sets of tools that you need to build um and it's not a single thing right so there's different angles to to come at this from the cell atlas data is helpful for understanding things on a cellular level. Um, one of the the kind of most important things that we're doing right now, the the um there's this this great company, Evolutionary Scale, who actually had a bunch of researchers who'd formerly worked at Meta on protein folding models, um, is joining a Biohub and and Alex Reeves, the the, uh, leader of it, is actually going to be the the kind of head of the whole science program, which is actually kind of interesting. Yeah. when you think about it where it's like you have AI and biology coming together and really it's like an AI person who understands biology is running it rather than a biologist who has some understanding of AI. I think just kind of speaks a little bit to where we think the the relative um weight of these things is. But I mean we basically view, you know, like Priscilla was saying with the different biohubs. Then New York doing cellular engineering will basically make it so that you can have cells that can record different things that are going on around the body and and share that data and then you can build that into models. The Chicago Biohub being able to record inflammation um and and basically study that in order to kind of help understand um like that. That's a that's a different data set. We have the imaging institute which is we just trained our our first set of models around that which are the first like spatial models around understanding like the way that that kind of cells look in different states and eventually just like you have this analogy on the um kind of the industry side around language models where you have different capabilities and then over time you train them into models and it gets more and more general. That's kind of the idea here. So we'll we'll we'll build the biohubs around grand biological challenges. The biohubs will build tools that will generate novel data sets. We will build models based on those and then eventually combine the models into an increasingly general view of a virtual cell that will be useful um both for scientists and hopefully startups and companies that are working on finding drugs which is not our part of the whole thing but but I think is obviously a really important part of what needs to happen. Yeah. And you know, you guys think about risk all the time in terms of when you make investments like I think the promise of being able to do virtual biology using a virtual cell model is you can actually take on riskier ideas. right now like grant funding can be hard to come by and the wet lab work is expensive and slow and it's not just you know money it's also time and so you have to choose something that you think is going to have some likelihood of success to keep your lab career going and so it naturally lends people to take on like some risk but not a lot of risk because they need to make sure that they are hitting like a certain percentage of the time to make tenure or publish or whatever they need to do. But if you had a virtual cell model where you could simulate really highquality biology, you could actually then start testing and tinkering on the computational side and like ask riskier questions, things that would have been expensive and t costly in terms of time and resources to do in the lab and actually see if there is promise doing the experiments in silicone before you make the time and money investment in the wet lab. Do you think of it kind of like a model organism? Yeah. like it's the new fruit of fly. Yeah. I was going to ask given the complexity of a cell, like how close um like how accurate do you think you'll get the model too? I mean just assuming I mean maybe you get it to like a perfectly accurate representation of a cell, but like how accurate to be useful with the virtual cell have to be? I think it will obviously iterate and get better and better because right now we we like right now we're still just talking about uh transcrytoics. are expanding into different ways of looking at the cell, but you get more and more accuracy and but I don't think it needs to be 100% accurate to be useful because you just want to be able to derisk the idea on the front end a little bit. Um, and the more and more you derisk it, the the more efficient it gets obviously, but it will be useful if you even get directional signal. And yes, I do. We do think about it like as a a model organism, but in a way that's like has fidelity to the human body, like you know, like I don't want to All models are wrong. Some are useful. Yeah. This is hopefully has has utility on certain access. Exactly. And just like the language models, you build in specific capabilities. So it's not so for example, you know, one of the models that uh we're we're publishing is is variant former, right? basically you know makes it so that um it's trained on a bunch of effectively pairs of you you have a cell you apply crisper to it in a place you see what comes out at the other side so it's it basically is able to make that kind of a prediction like okay if you have this edit that you're doing to to a cell what is likely going to happen um another one of the models is it's this diffusion model basically you can describe a type of cell that you would like it to simulate and it will just produce a kind of synthetic model of of of the cell Um, again, I mean, it's kind of interesting because to Priscilla's point before about how everyone is different and and like and different cells have have kind of um, you know, you want to be able to simulate these kind of rare configurations. Um, having at least a synthetic version of what that could look like is interesting and then you can test against that. The cryo model I think is interesting because it's spatial. So it kind of gives you a sense of there are all these different models that you can have that allow you to um basically look at different kinds of things and then you just train them in to be increasingly general over time. Wow. Very interesting. And is the is the modeling technology basically LLMs or like like is there is there a reasoning model? Is it like a just Oh, that's actually Yeah. I know that's a fascinating one too and because one of the new models um I think this one is very early but it's um it's it's basically the first reasoning model over biology. So the the idea is that um yeah, you you you effectively have these models that that kind of simulate world models in different ways and then you want it to be able to not just um be able to spit out correlations, right, in terms of like what it's found, but actually be able to kind of reason through how things would would evolve and why things would happen. Um I think that one's quite early but it's uh but it is interesting conceptually as what I think is clearly going to be an important direction um in terms of how these models evolve. Yeah. No it because that's what I was thinking you know that if it doesn't work the next question you have is why? Yeah. You know like but I think what you find in reasoning the the analogy you're married to your hypothesis. Well, yeah. Sure. Sure. Yeah. I mean, the the uh Yeah. I thought I thought you're saying if if the reasoning model doesn't work, why? I mean, I think the kind of way in No, it's I mean, the language model analogy for that would be you need better kind of world models or or better pre-trained models in order to get the reasoning to be good. But, but it's yeah, you just you build more you build more capabilities into it. And I think that there's probably an order, too. So the work that Alex and the evolutionary scale folks worked on is a lot of it is protein um which is interesting because that's at a kind of smaller resolution obviously than the cellular data the cell atlas but part of the hypothesis is that you can look at all these different cells and you can kind of simulate how they might behave but you're going to have a somewhat shallow understanding unless you actually have this hierarchical understanding of what um how the sub components of the cells are going to interact. So our view is that you basically want to build up a state-of-the-art protein model and then have that be a part of the state-of-the-art cellular model and then once you have that you build things like the virtual immune system which allows you to simulate um much more complicated systems. But it's sort of this like hierarchical approach to building up these these uh virtual models. That makes a lot of sense because also as you get into personalization, you've got like common proteins combining into a unique cell. So that makes it like from a systems standpoint that makes it like much more manageable. That that makes a lot of sense. Interesting. Yeah. Yeah. Know it's it's it's very fascinating stuff. Yeah. So you guys are announcing some big news this week. Do you want to give us a sneak preview? Well, I the big news is uh thinking about how we are going to be coming together as one team. Um and you know in the past we have done we've run biohubs and we've done built software we've done some AI research but all of it has been really thinking about has been a little bit decentralized but now under Alex's leadership we are going to come together as the biohub a uh an operating philanthropy where we are doing the science um in service of a singular goal together and how do we actually advance the state of biology and research um at the intersection of AI and biology. Amazing. Alex is amazing. So, yeah. No, he's great. And then and then the other thing is that the piece that that I mentioned earlier, which is just Yeah. I mean, CCI has focused on a number of different things. We've really just found over time that we we feel like we've been able to make the biggest difference in science. So, we've just kept on doubling down on it and we're going to continue doing work in education. We're going to continue supporting local communities and and in those different pieces. But going forward, the biohub is really going to be the main thrust of our philanthropy and we're very excited about that because I think that this is there there has been you know when we started the mission to see if we could help the scientific community cure and prevent diseases by the end of the century. I do think with the advances in AI that should be possible to do significantly sooner and that is a very worthy and important and very exciting goal that we think we kind of have a unique place in the ecosystem that we can help empower others to make fast progress on that. So there there's obviously like plenty of advantages to decentralization from a management communication overhead and so forth and so like what are you trying to add by adding this kind of new layer/unification on top like what what are the outputs and then I guess what are the complexities to that because that's um I'm sorry to ask a CEO question. No no I I mean I'm like super you want to go for it then I can jump in. Yeah. So there are obviously amazing groups doing frontier AI and a lot of groups doing uh great frontier biology and where we think we can do uniquely is actually tie these two together and we are we've funded data sets we've built data sets we're like building the instrumentation now to be able to look at the cell whether it's you know for at the tissue cell communication our cryoEM where we can look at the cell at nearly atomic level. So we have the ability to not only build the data sets but actually shape and form them the way we want based on what we see as necessary to complement the existing body of knowledge. And so we have amazing teams doing that work and we're building these AI models. And so what the reason to do it together is then we can actually complete the flywheel like you know the model is looking like it has some gaps and blind spots in this area. Okay, who do we talk to? How do we build um the next data set? And you know we're seeing this in the lab like the metadata is going to be so rich that we can feed back into the way that we do this modeling. Yeah. I think it's going to be incredibly powerful. And it's it's more than it's more than just like, you know, writing down a spec and saying like please deliver this. Like these people need to be sort of working shouldertoshoulder and shaping uh each other's work for this to actually um be the more and more accurate model of how the human cell works. Well, yeah. It's so interesting because that is exact like that's has been the biggest surprise in the industry for us in AI world like forget biology for one second is that the domain specific models have been like super interesting like the original thesis were like there's just some AIs are get so smart they're going to be smarter than everybody at everything but um like on video models like every video model is best at something but not everything And so knowing what problem you're solving actually turns out to be sort of ironically very important in AI um because you can actually get to a way better result. Yes. If you put the two together like yeah we're we're seeing that over and over over again uh in a way that that is I would say very counterintuitive to the whole narrative kind of going into it. And in biology it used to be the or at least you know one assumption was well the data sets aren't on the internet. So part of the reason you need a domain specific model is that the data sets are not public. you guys are kind of bucking that trend too by creating a lot of open- source access to the data and then even then it sounds like you're betting you know on the trend that we're seeing in other industries but still there will be nuance in how you annotate that data curate that data well and how you talk to a scientist right like so because you have to not only know the the data and the model and so forth but like the conversation is what we keep finding out ends up being very very important right so rich and so important how you actually a scientist isn't going to talk to it like you know I talked to chat at GPT or whatever. So, this is the fly you can talk to. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That that's really that's super exciting. And the user interface is actually really important. Um you talked about uh you guys have a founder who's using Cell by Gene. That user interface was intentionally designed to not need to have a computational or really a very deep biological background to be able to use because you want people coming from different fields to look at the problem. It's like look here, help us solve problems here. And so building that user interface in a way where it's not a very high barrier to entry to be able to poke around and learn something and bring knowledge back to your work, that's intentional. And we're really hoping when we build these virtual models um that we get to a place where we can allow a lower and lower barrier entry for people to say like you know like I have some knowledge about this maybe I can contribute. Um a very pertinent example is turns out I think immunology has a ton to do with neuro degeneration right but seems like immunology is behind all this so might be part of your century vision. Uh so you need to be able to allow the immunologists to come in and understand neuro degeneration and understand how their world fits in. And so the more you lower the barrier to entry allows people to actually think in a sort of truly collaborative and interdisciplinary way. So will the Biohub grow as a team? Like will you employ more people at the Biohub proper or are you moving towards more of a network model with more sites, more labs, more communitydriven data sets? Like which which is the thrust? Or maybe it's both. Probably a little of both. And we've added new biohubs over time. Um and then we're also building up more of this like central AI team. Cool. So um but I don't I think that these organizational questions of how do you set this up are fascinating and a lot of our approach is sort of informed by what the rest of the field is doing because I you kind of think about science as it's this portfolio right society has a portfolio of stuff that it's trying to do and as in terms of philanthropy you want to be the most additive that you can be by trying to figure out what else is underrepresented. So science by default is very decentralized, right? It's like kind of the the way that granting has worked, the way that I think scientists by default want to work. Um so I think a lot of what we've found is that figuring out ways to encourage collaboration in um ways that otherwise seem very simple but weren't happening before can unlock a lot of value. So the very first Biohub what we did there were two kind of interesting things. One was it was this collaboration between UCSF, Stanford and Berkeley and there are all these really smart people at all these different places who previously I guess in theory they could have figured out a way to work together but there was not really a formal construct for them to do that and this just allowed a lot more collaboration. Mhm. The other one is cross- discipline. Basically having biologists sit next to engineers and this view that like these two disciplines are things that need to um and I I don't know. I mean I'm sure you know you've seen this in a lot of in a lot of the companies but like it's there's so many interesting in the companies they always like set them apart. Well, it's interesting. No, it's interesting how many organizational questions or problems you can fix just by having two teams sit together, right? It's like it doesn't matter what the or chart is or like whatever. It's like you guys need to sit next to each other and until you get this thing to work and um that's something I really believe in. So, and you have 10 you have 10 to 15 years. Well, no, it's all like communication is such an underrated problem in general. Yeah. Uh in in all kinds of in building anything or solving anything. So, that's a that's pretty neat. Yeah. Yeah. And it's it's just really kind of simple stuff, but but I think it's um it's sort of novel as a model. And one of the things that's so we've now copied this from the first Biohub to the Biohub network and expanded it to other models, but it's also just been neat to see um other folks who are working in the field also adopt similar models because it's a pretty intuitive thing. But you know, at some point you'll reach the point where you know, actually it's really good to have decentralized work too, right? So it shouldn't be that like we're not saying that this is like the way that all science should work. We're just saying that there's a space for this. It can unlock a lot of value because it for whatever reason hasn't been the default. Yeah. And we still rely on like Yeah. There's famous like stories in the MIT lab about that. That's how they invented lasers and so forth is they put a bunch of people from different departments in the same the lab. Yeah. Well, actually physics is where we got a lot of the inspiration. like physics has just historically been like labs have just rallied around big projects and big shared resources. Um and we will you know we are relatively centralized but we still depend on a lot of labs who are doing sort of exact frontier work or complimentary work to come together to support this. There's that. But one more thought on your expansion question is like and maybe this is like the uh modern AI lab. We are not expanding like a lot of square footage per se, but we're expanding our compute. Um yeah, the research they don't want employees working for them. They don't want space. Yeah. They just want GPUs, agents. So it's just like in a sense that's new lab space. Um it's much more expensive than wet lab space. And you guys have always been creative on that. Even in the last few years, you've created ways to share access to compute. You've enabled academic labs to you know um I forgot the name of your program kind of like scientists and residents or something like that rental kind of hoteling. The core of it is clusters. um you know if you look at individual labs they'll have like like a large lab would have tens of GPUs um and we were the first to really build a large scale compute cluster um a thousand now we're we have plans to move to the 10,000 range and that one requires a different type of project obviously you're are able to ask different types of questions um and uh it's a resource that we use but also we've invited scientists to apply and say like what question do you have that uh could use this amount of resource and be able to uh stem uh sort of seed collaborations that way and so if a scientist is out there listening like who's not employed by the biohub or working at the biohub but wants to collaborate with the biohub that you're going to create interesting interesting doors to utilize the resources that's awesome yeah I mean the GPUs are somewhat zero sum Right. So that the data isn't. So yeah. Yeah. Fair enough. Yeah. So you're about to celebrate 10 years um doing this. As as you look out in the years to come, what else can you tell us about either things that you're thinking about for the future or maybe even principles or a northstar that's going to guide how you guys grow and evolve going forward? You know, it's been really interesting in the past 10 years because I actually spent the first few years completely envious of people working for for-profit companies because there's so much clarity. Like the market will tell you whether or not it's private or public will tell you if you're doing a good job. If they think you're doing a good job, if they think you're they're not always right. They're not always different. But I was still envious cuz that was I was like I craved that feedback like am I doing a good job? And you know 10 years in you the reason why we're doubling down on biology is like not only did we achieve what we said we were going to do and when we set out to set out on these projects it actually delivered more than we thought we were going to. And I was like okay that's a signal I can latch on to and like that's a signal I we can really continue doubling down and doing more of that. And so I think it's uh continuing to tolerate the early ambiguity when you're like, \"Okay, I'm gonna do more of this.\" Um and uh and being patient, but uh uh being willing to have a long time horizon, but be impatient at the same time. because it's all those iterations along the way that have sort of allowed us to get to this place where you know to get lucky ready having built data data sets to take advantage of AI and large language models that's because of all the work that we have been doing and so being able to continue moving forward in this ambiguity and sometimes lack of signal on a big goal like I think we've sort of set the DNA for that. Amazing. Oh, no pun intended. Yeah. But we get to see how many people use the tools and the feedback. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You have customers which is pretty cool. Yeah. For philanthropy. Like that's awesome. Yeah. No, it's it's one of the fun things about building tools is like you kind of get to see Yeah. How valuable do people find the tools? Do people use the tools in order to publish important work? Right. Right. Right. Right. Yeah. And well, I mean our feedback is they're awesome. Feedback and and completely unique by the way. So like the the other thing is like what would you use if you didn't have this? It's like there's nothing. No. Yeah. It's a real it's a real kind of void. I mean there's this whole pipeline that that needs to exist from accelerating basic science to funding a lot of people to use it to then you can get into the biotechs that basically can start to work on on on basically coming up with novel therapies and then you get the pharma companies that do them at scale. And then there's a space for philanthropy on the other side of public health of basically taking the the therapies and and kind of bring them out to everyone in the world. But this is a a space that and that there's just going to be a huge amount of leverage with AI and it is um yeah it's it still seems like there could be a lot more effort in the space around building tools and just accelerate the whole thing a lot better. Yeah. And I do think it is the place where you are completely unique. Right. The other things there are other people who can do that but there's nobody doing what that's got good good founder market. Yes. Founder market fit. I mean if we didn't exist would it be a problem? Yes. Like those questions uh really land you know as a VC like one of us as an engineer the other one scientist doctor. Yeah very happy this direction. Yeah we thank you very much not only for our companies but for us as humans um for working on this work. It's amazing work. Thank you. Thank you guys. Thank you so much. [Music]"

      "transcript": "Somewhere between 1 and 2 billion people in the world to have glasses for vision correction today, within 5 to 7 years. Is there like any world where those aren't all replaced with eyeglasses? The neural pad is going to be personalized to you over time. It's not actually picking up motion. It's picking up your muscles, firing. A lot of people who are designing technology, they make something that's kind of bulky, and they add a bunch of core functionality to and they're like, why don't people want to wear this? It's kind of a mantra internally that we have, which is this idea that AI is going to be the most important technology in our lives. We want to make sure that AI is in service of people, not just like something that sits in data centers and automates stuff. There are rumors that you're, like personally going founder mode calling researchers. What drove the decision for this llama for was not on the trajectory that they thought it needed to be on, like, why am I going out and meeting all of the top AI researchers? It's like, well, like, I want to know who the top AI researchers are, and I want to, like, personally have relationships with them. I moved everyone around me who sat with me, and now the lab is there. So, I mean, I'm pretty hands on every time I think of what a milestone would be in AI. They all seem to get achieved sooner than we think. Thanks so much for being here. Yeah. Good to see you. Thanks for doing this. So today we're talking everything connect 25. Can you give us the rundown of everything you're announcing and what you're personally most excited for? Yeah. So the main things that we announced at connect were our fall 2025 line of glasses and, you have them here. So, so we can just start and go through them. I mean, the first one is the next generation of Ray-Ban meta. So that's sort of the classic eye glasses that we've shipped so far. They're some of the most, you know, fastest growing consumer electronics of all time. We're very happy with that. And a lot of the improvements that we have for these are, you know, we doubled the battery life. We we have three K video resolution in them now for, for capture. And we're introducing new AI features like this, this thing conversation focus which, allows you if you're in a loud place, to basically turn up the volume on friends who you're talking to. So if you're in a restaurant or something like that, that I think is gonna be really neat. Then we've got this guy, which is the Oakley Meta Vanguard. So this is our second collab, with Oakley. It's, it's more of kind of a performance glasses. And, these I think are really cool for a number of things. And they're designed for, for a number of things around sports. You've got the camera that's centered. So that's great for alignment. It's wider field of view, louder speakers. They're they're water resistant. They can, you know, just just a bunch of that, they can connect with your Garmin watch so you can, you know, you can be running a marathon and, and basically, you know, like, you can tell it every mile, capture a video and then at the end, it'll produce a video for you where it stitches them all together and puts your stats from Garmin on top of it. So I think that that's that's a pretty neat thing. But I think the most interesting thing by far that we announced is this one, which we call ribbon, meta ribbon display. And that is because it is the first eyeglasses that we have shipped that have a high resolution display in them. And the other big breakthrough is that they pair with, with this guy, the, the meta neural band, which is the first mainstream neural interface, that we're shipping as the way to control them. And I think that that's pretty neat. I mean, basically every computing platform has its own new input method, right? So when you went from computers with the keyboard and mouse to phones with touchscreens, you kind of got a completely new input method. And the same, I think is going to be true for glasses and having a neural interface where you can just, you know, send signals from your brain with micro muscle movements like this. I mean, this is basically about as much movement as you need to make. And you can, you know, enter text, neurally. just do all the, all the fun stuff that you got a chance to try out. But but I think that this is a pretty big breakthrough. So I'm very excited about this, but but but overall, I mean the whole lineup is good. So so it was a it was a fun connect. So you had the Ray-Ban metas for kind of every day. The Oakleys for athletes. And then the displays now for power users. How do all these glasses kind of tie into that personal superintelligence vision. Yeah. So I mean, our theory is that glasses are the ideal form factor for personal superintelligence, because it's the only real device that you can have that can see what you see. You can hear what you hear, can talk to you throughout the day and can generate a UI in your vision in real time. And so there are other devices that people have. I mean, obviously you can have some AI on your phone, you can do some AI on your watch. You could do some of it if you just have like AirPods type type thing. But, I think glasses are going to be the only thing that can that can do all of the pieces that I just said kind of visual and audio in and out. And that that I think is going to be is going to be a really big deal. So I got to try it for this interview. Yeah. And I have to say, there were way more many use cases than I initially thought there was going to be. Like the AirPods, for example, have the live translation, but this is live translation. Yeah. Yes. The captions, there's so much more. Yeah, the subtitles are awesome. It's awesome. So I'm curious, like, what are your favorite kind of use cases that you've been using them for? I mean, the thing that, that I really had in mind when we were designing them for is just sending messages, right? I mean, this is the thing that I think we do the most frequently on our phones. I mean, I would guess that, you know, we all are sending dozens of messages a day. I don't really need to guess. And we run a lot of the messaging apps that that people use. And so I think we know that people spent sent dozens of messages a day and, we wanted to make it so that the experience is just really great. So now with the glasses, a friend texts you, shows up in the corner of your eye for a few seconds. It's off center, so it doesn't just block your view, it goes away quickly. It's not distracting, but if you want, you can just respond as easy as, you know, moving your finger like this. And you know I can, right? I mean, I'm up to like 30 words a minute typing with the neural text. So I think this is I think this is great. one of my kind of mental models for this is that, you know, in-person conversations are awesome. The one thing that I like about zoom is that you can multitask, right? It's like if we're having a conversation and you say something, I want to get some context, on what you're saying or if you remind me that I should go do something or, oh, you bring up a person and it's like, oh, yeah, I've been meaning to reach out to that person. Like if we're having a live conversation, I'm not just going to do that right then and then the chances that I'm probably actually going to forget by the end of the conversation. I follow up on most those things on zoom now. I kind of feel like you can just kind of text someone off to the side and that's that's fine. And this, I think is going to bring that to physical conversations, to where it's like, you don't have to break your presence. You don't have to like, you know, it's not it's not rude. Right? You're not like, breaking out a phone. You're not really. I mean, you can continue to really pay attention to the person at just like a very quick gesture with your wrist. And, I know I keep on having this, this, this phenomenon where there's, like, some information I, I want to have in the middle of a conversation. And normally otherwise, I would have had to wait till the conversation and text or call the person to get the information and go back to the person I was having the conversation. Now I just get the information. In the middle of the call. I just text the person, information comes in and then it's like, okay, you can have a much better and more informed conversation. So texting I think is really going to be the big thing. So how does a texting feature work? I know there's like you can talk to me I but you're saying you can actually write it down and it automatically goes to the phone is that gets the glasses to okay. So yeah. Yeah. With the neural band. So like you just really just handwriting. Yeah. I mean it's you can kind of think about it like as if you're holding a small pencil and then what, like what motion you would make to write out certain letters. But then what's going to happen is that the neural band is going to be personalized to you over time. So it's going to learn. Okay. How do you make W or J differently from someone else? And it will learn and you will kind of co evolve with it to the K to learn with the most minimal version of you making a J is or no or whatever. And, and then the feedback loop around that will, you'll just be able to make like increasingly subtle movements over time where it's not actually picking up motion, it's picking up, your muscles firing. So over time, I think you're basically going to be able to just move your muscles in opposition to each other. Not even really move your hand and, and be able to send messages or control a UI with your hand at your side in a jacket pocket behind your back. It's not. I mean, this isn't, it's not hand recognition. It's not, it's not the cameras on the glasses looking at what your hand is doing. It's this band picking up micro signals that your brain is sending to your muscles before they even move, so you don't actually have to move if you just need to, to be able to send the way to send the signals to it. And it picks it up. And yeah, that's so the wristband reads the electrical signals before you even move. Yeah. Why is that important over. Just like adding buttons to the glasses or like improving the voice commands. Well, I mean, okay, for voice, some of that, a lot of the time you're around other people. Right? So like, I just think that you want a way to control your computing device that is private and discreet and subtle. And one of the things that we thought about was, okay, can we get whispering to work? Because, by the way, voice does work too, right? You can control the stuff with voice. You can do voice dictation. You talked about AI with voice, but we just I just thought that there needed to be a way on top of that. That was in voice, for for when you want to do it more subtly and privately we could be having this conversation. I could, you know, have the glasses on and, like, a message, it comes in and. Okay, we're talking and I'm like, writing it and I've sent. It's done. I just I mean, in that time I could have sent a ten word message and that would be fine. That's so great. Okay. Then it's like, all right, now I got my response back in and okay, here, like maybe I'm writing another response and whatever. Yeah. Okay. Done. So, I think that that's going to be I think it's gonna be awesome. But in terms of buttons, I mean, yeah, that works too. I mean, you can you can take a photo by by tapping the button on any of these, you can hold it down to take a video. You can, you know, skip to the next track with the swipe or you can, you know, start or stop music by tapping on it. But, but I think the point is you don't want, you don't necessarily want that to be the only way that you could do it. Like now with the neural band, I can also just be like, I don't know, start and stop music with it in my hand, on my side. It's like, all right, like, it's like it's very subtle gesture. Like you can't even tell, right? Yeah. We were joking in the demo room that it's almost like right now when you go to classes, all the teachers are like, oh, put your phones down, they can see you. And like, students are like just checking their phones, distracted. But now it's going to be like, hey, like, keep your thumbs out. Almost, because it's like, I think it'll be take your glasses off or take your glasses off and show your thumbs. Maybe both. Yeah. But, yeah. So looking ahead, I guess, what you're saying is, like typing and speaking might not be enough to give you enough data to I. What you've been typing and speaking might not be enough to give. Well now we have electrical signals. We can also give to, to the. Yeah. For the UI. Yeah. For controlling the UI. Do you think like, the neural band is almost like a new interface to it? I, yeah, I mean, I think it's it's AI and it's the glasses. I mean, there's some parts of the glasses that are like, okay, you just have a menu of your apps and you basically can just, like, swipe through it very subtly with your hand and it's like, okay, now I've selected okay, now I've picked up that, you know, it's I mean, this is basically what the interaction looks like is like effectively it's like, okay, swipe a couple of times, I brought up the camera. Oh, now I have a viewfinder so I can see exactly what the what the image is. I want to zoom in. I just turn my finger a little bit. Actually, that's one of the coolest is when you're playing music. The way that you change the volume is you just pretend that there's a volume dial and you just turn your wrist and it's like, it just feels like magic. It's like really fun. The way you can bring up meta AI anywhere, you just tap twice. It's like. But but it's like. But I mean tiny, right? It's like the kick be your side. Like no one would even notice. So. Yeah. No, I think it's, I think this is just going to be by far the most intuitive way. But if you don't have it, yeah, you can control them with voice. You can control them with, with, with, with the buttons. I mean, different ways to do it. Yeah. So it's going to be both the AI and the, the UI of glasses and potentially over time, other things beyond glasses. I think that you'll be able to control with the neural band. That's really fascinating. Yeah. How long did it take you to pick up the controls? For the neural band? Yeah, for the neural band. Not that long. I mean, it's pretty intuitive. I mean, the way that you kind of think about it is, navigating. It's kind of like a D-pad. You kind of swipe your thumb right, left, up, down. You bring up the, the, the menu by kind of, you know, you can tap twice. You bring up that AI by tapping twice, you type as if you have a there. Enter text as if you have a pencil. The trick is that when you're learning upfront, the motions are a little bit bigger. And then very quickly, within a few days of using it, you get to like very subtle movements. and the reality is, is that a lot of the optimization isn't going to be on our side or your side, it's going to be the machine learning system over time, getting personalized to you and getting better. And, you know, it's the the times when the the neural text entry is slow. It's because I make a mistake and the autocorrect doesn't fix it. So now I have to go back manually and re enter the text. But yeah, I mean this is just like standard machine learning stuff as this just gets better and better and learns your patterns better, that just it's gonna be able to autocomplete more of what you're doing so you won't even have to make all the motions. So you've been calling classes kind of the next platform for years. Yeah. But the original or even met has really took off with just audio, and I, what did you guys stumble on there? So we have a few principles and building glasses, and the three principles that we talk about the most are they have to be great glasses first. Right. So you have to think about, okay for any of the before you even get any of the technology. You if you're going to wear these on your face all the time, they need to be good looking. They need to be light. And these are right. I think a lot of people that design, who are designing technology, they make something that's kind of bulky and they add a bunch of cool functionality to and they're like, why don't people want to wear this? It's like, well, most of the day people aren't taking photos or something, right? It's I mean, most of the day it's just there. And the magic of these is that they're good looking, comfortable glasses that you want to wear, and then you have them on your face. So when you do want to listen to music or call I or whatever, it's it's available to do that. So good looking glasses first. The other big principle is that the technology needs to get out of the way, right. So I think a lot of people, when they're designing technology, they, you know, they have this impulse to kind of add a lot of flourishes and, make it so that the thing that they've built, is kind of center stage. And, one of the things that I keep pushing back on with our team is no, actually, look, especially if you're building glasses, it is extremely important that whatever technology you have, it is there when you want to use it and then it gets out of the way. Right? You don't want random stuff in your vision, right? It's like, I don't care how cool of an animation you made on the design team, right? It's like like people, we want this to be super minimal, right? If message comes in, you see the message, it goes away when you don't want it. that I think the, the classic design just distill those principles. So yeah, I think it was kind of a hit for those reasons. The third principle, for what it's worth, is take superintelligence seriously. So it's a it's kind of a mantra internally that we have, which is, this idea that AI is, is going to be the most important technology in our lives. And, we want to make sure that AI is in service of people, not just like something that sits in data centers and like automate stuff. And, so we design these, even the early version, the first version of this, to be able to just have easy software updates to have improvements like the conversation focus thing that we talked about. So that way you can get like, can I have this great accessibility feature, you're in a loud place. You can turn up the volume on a person, right? It's like kind of crazy, but it's like, okay, so you build in the sensors first that you think that the AI is going to need over the next couple of years, and then you make it so as you get the software working, you can just update it so that we can bring the latest AI technology to two people, make them smarter with a software update. Well, I'm a big fan of personal question. Yeah. How far away do you think we are from these glasses being so good? You just replace your phone? So I think about it a little bit differently. I think about what is your main computing device right now? Phones are your main computing device. It's my main computing device for sure. But I didn't get rid of my computer, right. I just I have my computer, but I just use it less. Even a lot of the time. I'm even at my desk, and, my computer's right there. But if I want to go do something, I just take out my phone because that's like my primary thing that I do. So what I think is going to happen here. Is that I don't think we're going to get rid of our phones anytime soon. I just think our phone is going to stay in our pocket more or in our bag. And, even very subtle things like, I don't know how many times a day I used to look at my phone to see what time it was. Now, I don't do that when I have the glasses. You just tap quickly. The clock comes up done right. It's like, okay, I don't need to take out my phone to look at the time, okay? Now, like I don't need to take out my phone to look at messages, right? It's like, okay, now with these, the camera's great. But now with the viewfinder, I know, like, exactly what I'm capturing. So, so just, I think you just go kind of use case by use case and all these things I would have used to have taken out my phone for, I now don't, I think that's sort of the way it's going to go, but I would be surprised if. If we kind of get rid of our phones anytime in the next five years, I just think it's going to be less and less use slowly using the phone less. Yeah. I mean, the GPS feature is another one, right? Instead of having to look at my phone constantly, I'm going to use this like all the time. Yeah. Just have it in my glasses. Yeah. Navigating me where I'm wearing to go with the lines. Translation even was useful. Yeah, there's a lot I'm curious to see how other people are going to be using it, but, I think and I think people are going to be really curious about is the metaverse. How much of the vision is still distilled in these products? Well, I think we're getting closer to it. Right. So the metaverse is obviously it's a very visual experience presence. There's some parts of it like stereo audio, which, I mean, you can 3D audio which you can, you can get that as great. But, you know, starting to get the display, and then, you know, the Orion prototype that we showed last year, it's a wider field of view. It'll be a more expensive product when it's, when it's ready, but I think you're basically going to get to, you know, this is one where you can you can have a hologram. You can you can kind of have context. It's enough to kind of watch a video or have a message thread, but this product, especially because it's monocular, it's not putting 3D objects in the world. Right. So there still are things around delivering the sense of presence, like you're there with another person that I think is going to be really magical. And when we get the consumer version of Orion, you'll you'll really be able to, to start doing that. So I think we're kind of inching our way there. But this is a big breakthrough. I think the first kind of high resolution display with the neural band, and it's going to be a good step for learning how that goes. But yeah, no, I think the vision is that all of the kind of immersive software around presents that we have for VR, we would like a version of that to run on glasses, too. I want to switch gears to the the Vanguards. Yeah. The other fun, really stylish. I love to design, a recreation. We go on runs and on cycle. So I am using those. Well, how did you build these with athletes in mind? Well, I think a lot of people on the team, are pretty intense athletes, and and some of it is, you know, we just use the Ray-Bans, and, you know, I can't tell you how many pairs of Ray-Bans I fried taking them surfing. But it was worth it. But they're not water resistant, so. I mean, it's pretty obvious, like, you were like, okay, we want something that's water resistant. The extra, sound, the kind of power in the speakers. These are six decibels louder is really valuable and helpful when you're doing loud things. So, if you're cycling at 30 miles an hour and it's windy. The other day, a few weeks back, I was taking a call on a jet ski, and I could hear the person completely fine over the engine of the jet ski. And, and we have this advanced, like, noise reduction in the background. So we've designed these. It's got the microphone in the nose pad, which basically means that you could be in a wind tunnel and the other person on the other end of a phone call would not be able to hear any of the background noise. You just come in crystal clear. So, I think stuff like that is awesome. Then, you know, pairing it with, and then there's all this other stuff that I think you want for sports. The video stabilization is good. The pairing with Garmin and Strava, I think is good. We put an LED in the corner, so that you can have it light up when you're, to give you a reminder if you're to, to make sure you stay on pace that you want or in your target heart rate zone. So yeah, I mean, there's a lot of there's a lot of things like that that I think are going to be are going to be pretty neat for athletes. Yeah. It's fascinating. Why do you think it was important to design so many different glasses for different lifestyles? And how much broader do you really expect to go from here? Well, I mean, I think people have different styles, right? So, this isn't like a phone where everyone's going to be okay having the same thing and just like, can maybe have a slightly different color case or like put a different sticker on my case and then I'm good. Like, I think people have different face shapes. They have different esthetics. Like it's I mean, people wear different kinds of clothes. I think this is like an important part of our identity and sense of style. And some of it is functional too. I mean, some of it is a little more lifestyle, some of it is more active. And, you know, part of this is, some people prefer thinner frames, some people prefer thicker frames. You will always be able to fit more technology and thicker frames. So as we get to more display, like more advanced holograms, it will always be a little bit thicker of a frame than what you can do for the thinner ones. So I think that there's a choice that people will make around okay. Like, do I prefer the esthetics and the kind of the simplicity of the thinner ones, or do I like the esthetics of the of the thick ones? It's unfortunately, fortunately, kind of big glasses are in style so that that kind of work. So there's that, there's the whole, spectrum. And then there's also the price point in affordability. Right. And less technology. You're always gonna be able to offer for, for, for a more affordable price. And that's going to be great too, because we want to make it so that, you know, there's like more than a billion people. It's somewhere between 1 and 2 billion people in the world to have glasses for vision correction today. And I don't know, I think within, you know, whatever it is, 5 to 7 years. Is there like any world where those aren't all replaced with eyeglasses. And it feels to me like it's kind of like the iPhone came out and everyone had flip phones, and it's like just a matter of time before they're all smartphones, right? So I think that that's going to be the case with glasses too. But people have different glasses and they want different glasses and they want different glasses at different price points and style. So our goal is to just, work with a lot of iconic brands to do some, some great work. So on the Vanguards, you mentioned the Garmin integration. I thought this was fascinating. Yeah. Because this basically allows AI to kind of see your heart rate pace, location, everything kind of all hands free while you're running or cycling. How long do you think it will be before we have like a personalized coach that's there, like proactively in your ear? Yeah. I mean, it can do that a bit. So I think, for running, for example, if you want to ask it what your heart rate is or what your pace is, it can answer now. I mean, I don't know how hard you run, but when I'm running, like for performance, I don't really want to talk to something. Right. It's like there's you're probably above that heart rate zone. But there are times when I'm like skiing really fast and I want to know how fast I'm going because that's kind of fun. And, you know, you're not necessarily out of breath doing that. So, yeah, I mean, part of it is being able to talk to it and it can give you the stats in real time. That's one of the reasons why we built the LED in is, we want to make it so that, you just have a very simple visual indicator of, okay, am I on my my kind of pace target? Am I on my heart rate target? But I know you can kind of get a sense of, like, over time, it's going to be pretty good to have a display in those, too. Yeah. I mean, the real time coaching is. Yeah. So, like, I guess for an example, if I'm running and I want to say in zone two, which is, yeah, below a certain heart rate, I don't wanna go to too hard because I want to stay in the zone. I guess my question is, will I be able to have a coach that's telling me, oh, hey, slow down a little bit. You're all too fast. Yeah, that's the goal of the LED to start. And if you're trying to stay in the zone two, you probably can't talk to it. Right. Because I mean that's kind of the definition of zone two, right. It's like you should you should be able to. Right. So it's I don't know if it's the definition, but it's a proper answer. Yeah. Yeah. So, so you can, you can, you can basically you can ask at different stats and, and it knows if you're connected to Garmin. Yeah. So I know you've been training a lot. Have you like found any good use of it too in your training as, like almost like a coach or. Well, I take them surfing and they don't break, which is nice. There we go. Yeah. So, there's the ravens are good. But like I said before, I've, fried a few pairs of those, okay? And they captured moments, like, in real time too, right? Yeah. I mean, one of the nice things about this is because the camera is centered. It's like, really perfectly aligned. I mean, the image really in the video feels like it's coming exactly from, from your perspective. It's nice even when the camera's off to the side. But it's like these things about delivering a sense of presence. They kind of have this feeling where it's like when you get it to be perfect, it really feels like it clicks. And if you're like two degrees away, it's still pretty valuable. But it's not. But there's something about having it in the middle that I think is really quite compelling. Okay. And wide field of view. I'm excited to try them out. Yeah. So you're raising three kids while building superintelligence. I'm curious what conversations you're having right now about what? What was the about to grow up in, Well, I mean, it it comes up in a bunch of different things. But, in our family, we build a lot of robots. I, I'm really into 3D printing. I think that's like a really fun DIY hobby. My daughters are really into it. They're like making stuff. Kind of got to the point where I'm like, all right, you need to design your own stuff. I'm not just going to print stuff that we find on the internet. So now they're using all the different tools to to do that, and I work with them on that. It's like a fun hobby, but in a bunch of ways. I kind of think of robotics as like the thing after you get I mean, obviously they'll they'll kind of develop contemporaneously to some degree. But, but I think we're gonna have a really smart, kind of just kind of intellectual eye. And then you get the robotics, which is going to be the kind of fully embodied version of it. So, so, yeah, I mean, there's there's not that much that, you know, the kids could do with, you know, developing AI at their age, but you can actually, they can and they just enjoy making stuff. So, I mean, it's like kids love 3D printing and it's like, not very complicated. And it's just a fun hobby. And so yeah, so we have this project going on right now. First I just ordered a bunch of robots from the internet that you could assemble. That because there's like a bunch of starter packs and things like that and all of that. And then, the next one is basically designing our own and basically just like, you know, okay, 3D print the shell is you have the, the, you know, whatever the, you know, you do a version with the Raspberry Pi or the, the, the Jetson, you know, and just like, get that to, to to work pretty well for, for running language models and doing interesting stuff with it. Yeah. That's, that's a step up over Legos. That's fun. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. No. That's true. It's nice because Legos are, You run out of blocks. Yeah, right. But true. But with, like, the internet, you don't you don't run out. Are there any, like, specific, I guess, traits or skills you're trying to teach your kids? So, for example, Dennis Hassabis, he said learning how to learn is a really important trait is I think you're thinking of teaching, I mean, I mostly try to teach our kids to be good people. I mean, I guess there's like the there's all the intellectual stuff they're talking about, like, what's interesting, robots or whatever. But, I don't know. I mean, I think, like being caring and kind and things like that, I think are really important. So just a, a bunch of values type things like that. But yeah, I mean, I, I agree with Dennis's answer too. It's less about like learning a specific thing and more about kind of learning how to go deep on a thing. So I'm I'm a big believer that. So a lot of people say some variant of like, oh yeah, you want to learn how to learn but okay, but how do you do that? Right. And I guess my theory on how you do that is basically a very depth first approach. So rather than just like trying to have some conceptual framework, you complete a project, right? So like you will learn a lot by building a robot, like, whether you, actually care about robotics after that is completely incidental to, like, you took a problem with decomposed into all these things we needed to figure out, like the design for the 3D printing. And she needed to get the printers to work and then like, and then we needed to, like, get the Raspberry Pi to work, and it's like, okay, we're like learning a lot about wheels right now, right? It's like, okay, we're going to do treads. Are we going to do wheels? Like, how many wheels? Like, how do you want to, you know. So and that stuff, I think you basically it's like you're learning how to decompose problems, how to debug things. And that's like you just learn by doing. So that's, that's kind of my, my philosophy on it. Yeah, I like that. And I think just doing stuff we have common interests. So yeah, you know, it's like sometimes we, build a robot, sometimes we watch K-pop doing hunters, you know, it's like you got to have fun. Okay. Okay, so when we do achieve superintelligence, these glasses are going to see everything we see here. Everything we. And now even some of our muscle impulses. What human traits should we fight to preserve? And what should we just let go? Well. I'm not sure I agree that they're going to see everything. Or maybe there will be like some sensor that does, but they're not necessarily going to retain it. I'm not sure that you I mean, do you want them to, but so that's a whole separate direction that we can that we could go into. But I think just kind of like being able to pick out the salient bits are important, and giving people control over that is important. But, but that's not really the core of what you're asking. So the, I think like to me creativity is very important. And, like having a sense of here's like what you want to make in the world, And like, having an idea of how you, I mean, it's, it's some of the themes that we just talked about, like, how do you decompose that? What are the steps to do that? What are the tools that are going to be most helpful in doing that? I think is part of the job of a creator or a builder is to, like, be a kind of master of the tools that are available to them, right? If you're not, then you're not going to kind of be at the edge of, of your work. You know, it's a that's a competitive world. So, yeah, I kind of think. I don't know, I think the, the, all of the AI progress, I think has been very fascinating because people have sort of conflated intelligence with, like an intent or like a desire to do something. And I think part of what we've seen so far from the AI systems is that, you can actually separate those two things, right? Like the AI system has no impulse or desire to create something. It just it's kind of it sits there and waits for you to give it directions, and then it can go off and do a bunch of work. And so I think the human piece at the end is going to be, well, what do we want to do to make the world better? And I think some of that will be around like a personal kind of creative manifestation of what you want to build. But I do think some of it then, and I think in our industry we probably underplay this a bit, is just like caring about other people and, you know, taking care of people and spreading kindness and like so I think that that stuff is really important too. And I think I will help with that as well. So this conversation wouldn't be without obviously, the superintelligence labs that you've you've been on a spree over the last couple past months and all over the news. Yeah, it's been busy. Yeah, yeah. When did you decide to kind of make that change from the outside? There are rumors that you were, like, personally going founder mode, calling researchers, emailing all that stuff. What drove the decision for this? Yeah. I think I mean, it was largely lama for was not on the trajectory that I thought it needed to be on what I mean, Lama for was in many ways a big improvement over Lama three. But like, we weren't trying to be a bit better than Lama three, right? We were basically trying we want to build like we're a frontier lab, right? That's who wants to be doing leading work, right? That, so I kind of felt like. I learned enough about how to set up a lab that, that I wanted to kind of reformulate the work that we're doing, with a few basic principles. So one is huge focus on talent density, right? So you don't need many, many hundreds of people. You need, you know, 50 to 100 people. It's a group science project who can basically keep the whole thing in their head at once. Like, seats on the boat are precious, right? It's like, if someone is not, is not, isn't pulling their weight on that, then that's like it has this huge, negative effect in the way that it doesn't for a lot of other parts of the company. So I think like just this absolute focus on, like having the highest talent density in the industry, drove a lot of what you heard about. Okay. Well, like, why am I going out and meeting all of the top AI researchers? It's like, well, like, I want to know who the top AI researchers are. And I want to, like, personally have relationships with them. And, and I want to build the strongest team that we can. So that was that was a big part of the focus. There are other parts to like, I think when you're doing long term research, one of the principles that we have for the lab is we actually don't have deadlines that are top down, right? It's like it's research, right? You don't know how long the thing is going to take. All the researchers, you know, everyone's competitive. They all want to kind of be at the frontier and doing leading work. So, you know, me setting a deadline for them isn't going to help. It's not it doesn't help them at all. Right? It's like they're moving as fast as they can to try to understand, the, the kind of what we need to solve the problem. So, but that's, that's kind of. Yeah. So we organize the lab to be very flat. We don't want layers of management that are not technical. Right. It's a the issue is people start off technical and then they go into management and then six months or a year later you like still think you're technical, but you're actually like haven't been doing the stuff for a while. So you're the, the knowledge just kind of slowly decays or quickly decays in a, in an environment that's moving as quickly as that. So anyway, those are the basic principles. But I think that overall, taking a step back, I think that AI is going to be the most important technology in our lives in our lifetimes. Building the capacity to build absolutely leading models, I think, is going to be a really critical and very valuable thing for, for unlocking creativity, building a lot of awesome things. So, yeah, I'm absolutely just going to focus and do the things that we need to do in order to, to to make sure that we can continue to do that. How hands on are you still with the lab? Well, I'm in the lab. I moved everyone around me who sat with me, and now the lab is there, so. I mean, I'm pretty hands on. That's like. I mean, I mean, you the chief scientist, you know, sits right next to me. So. And, you know, a lot of the, the other teams sit within 15ft of me. So, so, I mean, what would I say? I, I mean, look, I'm not an AI researcher, right? So it's not like I'm, like, in there, like, telling them what research ideas to to do the things that I can do is as CEO of the company, I can make sure that we have the very best people and talent density. I can make sure that we have by far the highest compute per researcher, and that we do whatever it takes to go build out all that capacity. I mean, you probably saw the announcement that we had we're building this, Prometheus cluster, which is I think it's going to be the the first kind of gigawatt plus single cluster that's like a contiguous cluster for training coming online next year. And, we're building a, cluster in Louisiana that is, it's going to be five gigawatts, and we're building several more clusters like that that are that are just going to be multiple gigawatts. So, yeah. So I mean, that's that obviously takes some conviction. I mean, we're talking about many hundreds of billions of dollars of capital. So you both need to have like a good business model that can support it and you need to believe in it. So I, that's that's one thing. And then like, there's all these other parts of running a company where, I don't know, I mean, like big companies have positives and negatives, and it's sort of my job to make sure that we channel all the positives that, that we can towards this effort. And then I can clear as many of the kind of things that would otherwise be annoying about running a company out of the way. So, you know, when we build something awesome, we'll get in our apps and get it to billions of people quickly. That's a good thing that you can do inside a big company. And then like whatever the other kind of things, that would be more annoying. It's sort of my job to clear them out of the way. So how do I do that? Well, I want to make sure that I know the researcher as well. Right. And that they, you know, that, like when they have an issue that they feel comfortable texting me or just like walking over in my desk. And, so I think that that's actually part of running the whole thing well is like, is that the kind of like I have that rapport with them? And, in that way I can be in the information flow to understand what the issues are that they're having so I can go sell them for them. So it's like building the culture of everything. I was open, everything moves fast. Yeah. And you're personally talking with all these researchers. Yeah. I mean, I'm doing other stuff for the company too, obviously. But yeah. And but yes, I'm just trying to make sure that we move as quickly as, as, as, as we can to get the researchers what they need to do the best research in the industry. Last question. If we do achieve superintelligence, then whenever that is, what are the plans to integrate it into existing products? Yeah. I mean, I think when you have superintelligence, the nature of what a product is will change pretty fundamentally. I mean, you think about our products today, a lot of the big ones, or if you look at Instagram or Facebook or our business model around ads, they're basically already these very large transformer systems or the recommendation systems, not language models today, but they're basically already these big, massive scale machine learning systems. So, I mean, in the future. Do you think we'll, we'll get to a point where, you know, instead of having it be a recommendation system that, you know, has some kind of basic understanding of what you might care about and therefore can kind of spit out an idea for a story. And then you have the app that renders it. I just think you'll have models that you'll interact with directly that, that, that it'll, it'll recommend content. It'll generate content. You'll be able to talk to it. Right. It's like just so I think it's this stuff will be much more integrated. And then, I think that that sort of culminates in the glasses version where I think what you're going to get is eventually this always on experience that, I mean, you can control when it's on and off, but it can be always on if you want where it can, you can just let it see what you see here, where you hear it can go off and think about the context of your conversations and come back with, with more context or knowledge that it thinks you should have. When you need an app, it can just generate the UI from scratch for you. In your vision. I, I'm not sure how long it's going to take to get to that. I don't think this is like five years. I think it's going to be quicker. So, two, three. It's hard to exactly know, but, but I don't know, I would guess it's, every time I think of what a milestone would be in AI, they all seem to get achieved sooner than we think. So I think like my optimism about AI has generally only increased as time has gone on. In terms of both the timeline for achieving it and how awesome it's going to be."
